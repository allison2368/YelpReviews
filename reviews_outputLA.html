<p>This is my second review on Granville in Weho and this place never ceases to amaze me. Our server Sebastian served us Sunday brunch on the patio and he was absolutely amazing and attentive. So polite and friendly. There were 3 of us seated. We had the smoked salmon and rye crisps, eggs in purgatory (shakshuka), and the Granville salad with added sliced medium cooked steak. All was excellent but my favorite was the smoke salmon dish. I actually had my husband do take out on that and avocado toast when I got sick the following week and it was exactly what the doctor ordered. My girlfriend had the California Love and the Hibiscus rose which was absolutely delicious but I'm a whisky lady and I prefer hot alcoholic beverages (like hot totties) So I asked for bourbon neat with green tea on the side and then after the meal had an Irish coffee. I am a caffeine addict and do not like weak flavored stuff. I like my coffee strong, so strong that it'll show up on a drug test strong. Granville has the good sh*t. So I've been at this location a few times now and I've not had a bad experience yet. Call me a regular now. I also want to do a shoutout to Katie our dinner server and to the dinner kitchen staff, a few weeks prior, Katie recommended to me and my husband to get the pork chop and ahi tuna entree. We were there to get a super quick bite before a special event and she prioritized our meal to come out quicker than normal. We had to be in and out within 45 mins and we were lucky that it was early in the evening and the restaurant was not too busy yet. We licked our plates clean and had time to spare for a quick coffee. I just love how the whole staff looks out for one another and several of her co workers checked in on us. Honestly I would be here everyday if parking was a bit easier. Since it's right across from the hospital, neighborhood and meter parking can be difficult if you don't want to valet.</p>
<p>Not great, not bad, just ok. I wouldn't come back.Our waiter asked if it was our first time there and gave us menu recommendations when we said yes. We ordered things which were all from her recommendations.Grilled cheese dippers - These were decent. Came with 4 pieces which added up to about 1 sandwich and a small cup of soup. I've had much better, it wasn't my favorite. If you don't like caramelized onions, steer clear of this - I feel like that flavor was very apparent in the grilled cheese.Thick-cut pork chop - She said this was probably the most popular item on the menu. I will say it was the juiciest pork chop I've probably ever had. It was a nice thick piece of meat and the char added a nice flavor. The cranberry-mango compote added a nice sweetness, but I think the pork chop could've had more flavor overall.Angel hair - This was also decent. It had a very light sauce (white wine clam sauce). I don't have much to say about this one to be honest, it wasn't that memorable.Flourless chocolate cake - This was pretty good, but again, I've had better. I didn't find myself NEEDING to go back for another bite. It would be better with vanilla ice cream, not sure whether or not that's an option.This restaurant is very cute and our waiter was very friendly. It's honestly what I would expect from a pretty LA restaurant - very well decorated and a lovely place to visit with friends, but mid food. Nothing that great!</p>
<p>I came here for my birthday lunch, and it was a great spot for the whole family. There is so much seating, and a variety of seating at that. The menu is also super extensive and flexible. My family and I chose to sit outside since it was a nice day. I ordered the santa barbara chicken sandwich. This was just an upscaled version of my weekly panini, but it was tasty. I had that with sweet potato fries, which were also really good. My family got spicy pasta, village wagyu burger, and spicy chicken plate. They all enjoyed their meal as well. One note is that only the pasta was piping hot, all of the rest of the food seemed just warm. Not the biggest issue but just something to note. The service was also fast and nice.</p>
<p>Granville had an eat and drink week so my friends and I met there to indulge in a 3 course meal for a set price. The food was good BUT the server was swamped and the service was not the greatest. My friends and I originally ordered 3 soups but the soup that me and another person ordered was not available. So we swapped to the Macaroni and cheese as our starter and my other friend ordered the Tomato Bisque. You would think that these items would be already made. Especially the soup, NOPE. We received our starters AFTER our meals. The vanilla craft soda was really delightful. The salmon was really good as well as the Mac and cheese once received. The dessert, flourless chocolate cake, was really nice.Parking sucks BUT if you park on the other side of the block, there's ample metered parking. And the place is a beautiful location.</p>
<p>Came in for brunch on Saturday morning. No issues getting a table and service was fast! Plenty of metered parking down the street. Food was amazing. The potatoes and sausage in the village breakfast were delicious. The French toast was also so good! Can't wait to come back for lunch/dinner.</p>
<p>Food and service were pretty good and there wasn't much of a wait when we came with a party of 8. We celebrated a birthday and had brunch + drinks here and it was a fun time! From what I remember, the server we had was nice and very attentive to us. The restaurant is very clean and modern inside, with a lot of light coming in through the windows and ceiling so there's nice natural lighting. I believe there is valet parking available, but we just found street parking on the side street of the restaurant. We ordered a lot of different appetizers and entrees and their portions are pretty big even when you're sharing!</p>
<p>Service - 5/5 (server was Jake)Ambiance - 5/5Food - 4/5Had an 8:30pm Friday reservation for a party of 11 and was seated immediately. Jake was our server and took excellent care of our boisterous family (provided recommendations, joked with us, attentive).This restaurant is ideal for big parties because you are seated in your own area. Spicy chicken pasta - creamy farfalle pasta with a kick. Would order again. Rainbow trout with green beans - star of the show for me. Cooked to perfection and seasoned just right.</p>
<p>Granville is a nice restaurant located on the edge of Beverly Hills and Weho. We went there for brunch, they have street parking as valet. The ambiance is casual and the sun shining through the ceiling gives it a nice touch.For brunch they have brunch as well as lunch menu available. For appetizers we ordered the lettuce cups and heirloom burrata. The lettuce cups are amazing, very fresh and good. The heirloom burrata was alright. For entree I had their skirt steak and eggs. The steak was good but the potatoes came out a little dry and under seasoned. Drinks and service was great overall. The host was really sweet.</p>
<p>I thought the the menu and website vibe looked pretty good, so we decided to try this for lunch. It's located on a nice corner in West Hollywood right near the Beverly Center. They've got some nice out door sidewalk seating for your dog and it's all open to the street when the weather is good, which is most of the time in this part of the world.Our server was friendly enough but seemed like he was highly stimulated with i don't know what, but he was talking a mile a minute and it was a bit intense. Just like "too much information, please slow down." In any case he got the job done and didn't hang around too much. He was just way too intense though friendly enough.I had the piri piri chicken lunch plate, which was good but the piri piri  had no heat/depth and could be improved on. The slaw and mashed potatoes were good. I also had a side of brussel sprouts with currants and toasted almonds in a delicious vinaigrette-I think this was the best part of the meal. My companion had a burger-they wouldn't cook it rare, so medium rare was the request, but it came out much closer to medium/well instead of rare. Finally, we had the flourless chocolate cake which was neither here nor there-not bad but not exciting. It was served with I think port cherries, good because they're not too sweet, and a pool of creme fraiche, which is a good match for a chocolate dessert.At the end of the meal our high intensity server somehow managed to forget to add in the coffee and cappuccino. When we mentioned the overdone burger, he said so sorry, and I'm gonna comp you the coffees, let me know next time please please, so no charge for those, which was at least a good touch. While the food was pretty good and service was friendly enough, it's not really anything special or great, nor bad in any way. Just middle of the road, not too expensive for the area, and decent. I would not rush back, but if I were in the area and looking for a place to eat that's reasonably good and I'm not being too picky, I would go.</p>
<p>We enjoyed our visit to Granville. We were able to secure street parking close by. I had the chicken soup with a matzo ball. It was tasty. My entree was the vegetarian lettuce wrap. It was delicious.  The sauce added a sweet and tangy touch. The burgers god raved reviews as did the steak sandwich. Service was good</p>
<p>No Fees</p>
<p>The food was fine and the ambiance was nice. Our server was the bartender and he was kind enough but a bit too busy to focus on our refills and checking in.I ordered the salad with add on veggie chicken. It came out to $23, which I would call very over priced for the portion size. The taste was good but it was a small salad and the $6 add on protein was super bland without much thought given to its preparation.My husband got the Caesar salad with an $8 salmon add on. He enjoyed it but, again, it was small.I don't think our waters were ever refilled. I can understand being busy but I probably wouldn't revisit simply because of the unwarranted high prices.</p>
<p>The food here it's always spot on. This particular place is quite sexy with this openness and light that comes into the room.  Not every room it's like that but they do have a section that is very beautiful if you come here for the daytime.  Like every location, you are seated when  all your party is there. The wait time is not as extensive it feels here than in Pasadena.  Food wise had the pasta and salad and there was nothing to complain about because I always end up finishing it and wishing I had more. The portions are just right and of course I wish just more!Certainly a service here is very friendly. It could be the people the vibe and the energy. If you like talking it seems like every waitress and server here will talk to you. Love it.</p>
<p>These five stars are for the food, service, and ambiance. First off, I love how this location allows reservations unlike the one in Pasadena. Secondly the customer service was off the chain. I know there are plenty of snooty customers here daily, I witnessed many while dining here. But that's not what we are here for lol our waitress Charis M and manager Celine were exceptional. This was the first time my friends and I dined here for brunch and we will definitely be coming back. From the drink recommendations to the food everything was delicious and tasteful, It was a group of six of us and we all enjoyed a variety of items on the menu. I will say the grilled cheese dipper and skirt steaks were highlights of the dishes,The cucumber martini was phenomenal , lemon drops were also delicious! Overall our experience here was a really good one thanks to Charis and Celine please continue to hire wonderful employees like these ladies!</p>
<p>Pleasant location, quick service.The food was tasty, well prepared and fresh. Loved it</p>
<p>Stopped here while visiting LA and it was amazing!! We were able to get a reservation on a Saturday  for party of 10 and due to traffic we were 30 mins late. The hostess and staff were SUPER accommodating and understanding and we were able to get in without issues. We tried a few apps and ahi, spicy pasta, steak and angel hair pastas. Others at the table tried a few other things but I didn't get a photo. Everything was amazing and the portions were huge. Our server Ken was GREAT!! We had so much fun with him and he gave us great recommendations. I'd absolutely visit this place again just to see Ken lol</p>
<p>Sunday brunch! The pancakes and bacon were delicious. The wagyu tacos weren't my favorite. But everything else was top notch including the lemonade.</p>
<p>Great food, close to Cedar's, for those of us who are waiting for someone in surgery. Service is good, but sometimes inconsistent. Still, it's my favorite close-by restaurant..</p>
<p>Stopped by Granville for Happy Hour (3-6pm on weekdays). Happy Hour is at the bar only. I was pleased that they have some bar stools with back support. There's also an option to sit at the high top tables around the bar if you want.  We got the taco trio with plant based chicken, the mac and cheese with plant based chicken, and the butter lettuce cups. I split a picante pineapple margarita with another diner in our party.Granville's happy hour has lots of vegan and vegetarian options. We enjoyed everything we ordered. Prices are very good. This happy hour is great for solo dining as well as small groups. They do not offer free wifi. We found parking on the street but there is also valet in the back.</p>
<p>We've been to many of the Granville locations. We've had great experiences. This one in WeHo was just ok. We were there for 40 minutes. And I eat slow!  The food was great, it came out really fast. Really fast! I had the steak sandwich with chips. The husb had the beef stroganoff. Both dishes were tasty.</p>
<p>I went here for dinner on a Friday night, and I was able to make a same-day reservation for 2 at 8:45 pm which was super convenient. I've only ever been here for brunch, so I was excited to try their dinner menu, and it did not disappoint.We ordered the grilled cheese dipper to start which was delicious, and the caramelized onion inside was a nice touch. The tomato bisque was flavorful and paired well. For entrees, we got the angel hair pasta and the peri-peri half chicken. The pasta had an awesome balance of flavors and I could not stop eating it. The chicken had great flavor too and wasn't all that spicy as advertised. The broccolini was seasoned perfectly and the mashed potatoes were creamy and tasty.Overall, the portion size was great for relatively reasonable LA prices. We ended up taking boxes home because there was so much food. The restaurant itself is a very cool space. It looks different during the daytime and nighttime so I would recommend going both times because it gives a different vibe. I would definitely go back for dinner and brunch, and I recommend this as a good spot to catch up with friends or for date night.</p>

<p>My favorite restaurant in Hollywood! It's so perfect for solo dates and the Owner and his family offer great service! I love Running Goose</p>
<p>Running Goose is a hoot! Me and my kids wanted a good spot to eat with great quality. One of my kids is vegetarian so it can be hard to find good options of him, but their vindaloo was delicious. These were the appetizers we got baked Brie and potatoes and they were scrumptious!  A bit pricey but worth it for the quality and portions.</p>
<p>We found this place on yelp after searching dog-friendly eating establishments. I love bringing my fur baby everywhere, so that alone is an instant win in my book. We arrived a little after 1 PM on a Saturday. It wasn't too crowded and the noise level was perfect. The restaurant is situated near a busy street so you will hear cars and passerbys occasionally. I loved how quaint and relaxed the space is. We sat outdoors on the patio and instantly felt at ease.  Soft lights twinkle overhead, strung along the canopy while bossa nova music plays gently in the background. An abundance of plants and trees are strewn throughout the space. It felt like a nice weekend reprieve. The service is very prompt and attentive. Waters and wine refills were also quick and the appetizers and courses were timed perfectly!Now on to the food! We tried one of the daily specials which was the roasted carrots with carrot aioli and it was fantastic. There was a nice crispy texture and crunch to the carrots and the middle is soft tender and moist. They tasted almost caramelized and it was so so good! I am not one for ordering vegetables as appetizers so I was pleasantly surprised.I ordered the duck confit and was not disappointed. The duck skin was crispy and well-seasoned and the meat was tender. The sweet potato and broccolini were seasoned wonderfully. The wine reduction was slightly tart which was a perfect offset to the sweetness of the vegetables. For the portion size and quality, I felt as though the price was really affordable. I am used to paying a lot more duck so this sold me. I could see how this dish is one of the most highly rated on the menu! My date had the salmon fettuccine which was rich, decadent, and creamy. I didn't get to take a picture because guys like to inhale their food) The portion of salmon, pasta, and vegetables was also very generous! Since dessert has its own stomach compartment, we ordered the coconut pudding. It had a nice hint of coconut with a strong caramel flavor, and a hint of nuttiness from the sesame garnished on top. A perfect blend of flavors. I loved how chewy and moist the bread pudding was. It was very reminiscent of butter mochi desserts from Hawaii. Overall, amazing food and ambiance. I left a happy customer and will be returning to try more of their dishes again soon!</p>
<p>Lovely and helpful staff and fantastic food. The Short Rib is stunning. We also took a few other dishes to try something new and overestimated ourselves a bit. 1 portion of soup can feed 2 people, and the pork for 2 is more like for 3.Anyway, great evening and would recommend it. And btw the menu is huge so everyone can sth to taste it.</p>
<p>My friend had her birthday dinner at Running Goose and it was AMAZING. I was the first person there because punctuality is important for me and apparently I needed to get with the program lol.Howeverrrrr, I would presume it was the owner, a slender man. But he was so gracious and open and already knew of the reservation. He inquired if we would want to sit inside or outside on the patio. Well, since it was only me to make this TOUGH decision, lol, I chose outside... YOLO.Running Goose was perfect. The staff was kind. I ordered the Smoked Beet Quesadilla and that was very unique. I would have never even imagine a beet quesadilla and it was interesting. I was not mad at it. I would have LOVED chicken in it BUT it was still good lol. They have a fire pit to sit next to and enjoy your meal as well. It was perfect. They can accommodate large parties. It IS in Hollywood so parking is tricky.</p>
<p>A peaceful hidden gem in an otherwise bustling area of Hollywood. The chef is very thoughtful about his dishes and the service is remarkable. I loved the white sangria. I'll definitely be back! Food: 10/10 Drinks: 10/10 Affordable: 6/10 Atmosphere: 9/10 Vegan-friendly: 7/10</p>
<p>I ordered the Duck Confit Kak'ik and the Lamb Tagine which was okay. Both dishes looked wonderful. I also ordered a glass of red sangria. I think my favorite part about this restaurant is the outdoor seating and the service. Overall, nice ambiance.</p>
<p>We had eaten at the Goose once before the Van Gogh exhibit. Our party of 4 were headed to the Vampire Circus show at the Mantalaban Theatre on Vine St. The Goose is short walk from there. There are many interesting storefronts on the walk to the Goose from our parking spot. Being in the heart of Hollywood it's no surprise there was a definite aroma in the air, not tobacco. The Goose specializes in Latin flair in their cuisine. The main eating area is a cozy covered patio to the side of the entrance. Our orders included 3 Gringo Burgers and an order of Moroccan style lamb.  The lamb was deemed excellent and the Gringo Burgers were also excellent. The Goose has a good burger choice. The ambience of the Goose is vibrant on show nights and the staff are eager to please. Give it a try if you venture into Hollywood.</p>
<p>This is one of my favorite places I've tried in LA when looking for a place to eat lunch in Hollywood area.The corn tostada ($4) had this burnt corn aioli that was smoky and delicious. The tomato tostada ($4) was intimidating since it had so much queso fresco, but it perfectly contrasted the charred heirloom tomato jam. I definitely recommend trying the tostadas because they are so unique in flavor!As mains, we had the chilaquiles ($18), which was slightly on the saltier side, but had very tender short rib. I liked it better than typical chilaquiles with a lot of chips overpowering the dish. The real winner was the vegan pesto vindaloo ($20) though -- it had such great flavor, texture, and exactly what I want all my vegetables to taste like. I'd definitely come here again to try more of their dishes :)</p>
<p>This week I was lured into Running Goose by their baked brie (thanks fellow Yelpers!) but they've now made a future repeat customer out of me. I had delivery this week and was happy everything arrived safe & sound. I started with coffee and it came hot & ready to go down the hatch.Their tostadas were so bomb! The carrot tostada had so much fresh, shredded carrot piled high sprinkled with herbs and queso fresco. Then the Corn Tostada had burnt corn aioli, lime, parsley and basil. Both are huge wins and I'm already craving them again. And just $4!? Yessss, please!The baked brie was a huge hunk o' cheese topped with apricot compote, roasted pepitas, roasted garlic, and sage, plus served with some toast pieces for $17. Don't get me wrong, I like the pepitas but those little things are so annoying getting stuck up in my teeth like they're corn on the cob! lol! Not holding it against them I had to floss after eating this and it was great. Cheese and fruit is a failproof method of creating a great dish but they've done it perfectly here classing it up with a lesser used fruit and accompaniments.I've become a big fan and can't wait to try more off their menu~!</p>
<p>No Fees</p>
<p>A gem just off Hollywood Blvd. Looking for a dinner place before hitting the Pantages Theatre, the Running Goose was a perfect choice. It turned out that the valet parking proved to be a whole evening bargain compared to area-prizes otherwise. Most importantly, however, the place was very cute, the staff knowledgeable and attentive, and the food just perfect. Light, fresh, tasty and excellent to share.</p>
<p>Visited this restaurant based off of a recommendation on Instagram, and needless to say had a very mixed experience. First, the service was very good. The staff was very nice and helpful when describing the menu and some of the more popular items. Secondly, the food was delicious. My friends and I each enjoyed our plates as we ordered everything from the calamari to the chilaquiles and steak.  The short rib in the chilaquiles was super tender and flavorful and I could've eaten bowls of it the remainder of the day. The biggest issue we had while dining was simply the flies that were around due to a lot of the live plants from the environment of the restaurant. So that was a bit of a nuisance when dining and trying to fight off the gnats a little bit during the earlier hours of brunch.Unsure if that's a normal experience, but aside from that definitely recommend the cuisine here.</p>
<p>Running Goose is the best. Their food is absolutely amazing, and their service is spectacular! Narine went above and beyond for us! Such a romantic ambiance in their outdoor patio in the evening. I would highly recommend visiting and ordering their Alfredo, it was the best I've ever tried. I will 100% be returning. Thank you guys for being the best!</p>
<p>A fun, eclectic menu in an adorable patio setting; I love when Hollywood isn't always mega-glam. The menu is definitely fun and a little pretentious, but in a good way. It explored many interesting flavor combinations, and most were very successful. Baked brie was 5/5 exceptional; the housemade apricot compote pairs wonderfully with the cheesy, gooey brie.The soup of the day was a spicy orange gazpacho which was also a 5/5---I think it was basil-y &/ cantaloupe-y? Super refreshing, and perfect for the season.What was really interesting was the Vegan Pesto Vindaloo (4/5) --- what a concept right? While the flavors were excellent and warm and spicy, the dish itself felt a little half-baked and confusing. I wasn't sure it was meant to be consumed in the medium it was presented in, and it felt a little unfinished. That said, I enjoyed the tapas/appetizers enough to definitely keep Running Goose on my radar and return to explore a menu that I expect to change soon.</p>
<p>We decided to have dinner before attending our Mamma Mia musical at the Pantages. It's definitely a nice walk. Lots of restaurants to choose from in the area. Great ambiance, great service. Delicious food</p>
<p>I want to say the nicest things about this place because the waiter was so genuinely happy and kind to us. But the food was just not on point in my opinion. I love the vibe. I love the service. I wanted to love the food too! Will be back again though to try a different item on the menu.</p>
<p>Second time I'm here, and the dishes are as good as if not better than last time. Consistency and quality is the name of the game here.The bun on the burger toasted just right, with the flavor of the grill coming through strong on the patty, the burger being the right size to not be obnoxiously hard to eat but also be a mouthful of flavor. I'm not sure if the farm vegetables are different seasonally, but the carrots they used for this dish were awesome, and the crisp on it along with the seasoning, could definitely go for a whole bowl of this if I could.</p>
<p>I highly recommend getting the duck confit. Delicious tender duck, which pairs really well with the carrot purée which is incredibly flavorful without being too much. The lamb chops were delicious with the sauces to pair with. The short rib dish, French onion soup, and chocolate dessert were definitely not bad, but aren't the type of dishes I would get again. Service was attentive and nice and the outdoor ambience was cute. You can tell the owner (or manager?) cares a lot about how the food comes out. And it's a nice little getaway from the hustle and bustle from Hollywood even though you're smack dab in the area.</p>
<p>VEGAN REVIEW Had dinner here before at the Pantages (east walk).There are not a ton of vegan options, but this place would prob be great for vegetarians (lots of cheese). Had the beet quinoa salad as my starter (hold the cheese) & vegan pesto vindaloo as my main. Both were ok, nothing to write home about. The vindaloo is oddly served with 2 small pieces of sourdough bread,  no rice. Seemed like frozen peas & carrots? Service was good. We sat on the patio, which was nice.</p>
<p>Ok so the salt cod churros aren't exactly the most photogenic appetizers but they are absolutely delectable. I drive all the way from Orange County to indulge in these umami treats every once in a while. The way the waiter confirms the order: "salty, fishy, savory, earthy" is so smart, on point and begins to excite the taste buds before the snack is even delivered. If any street art fans out there are reading, these would have made for an amazing concessions at Banksy's Dismaland in place of the sweet dessert churro but not in a negative way, just pure trickery.I crave this confusing crispy concoction constantly and have to recommend it to my fellow advanced-pallet wielding foodie friends. Don't knock it, just eat it. Trust me. I dub thee the five star fish stick lol</p>
<p>No Fees</p>
<p>Where they have been serving their famous Kimchi Bacon Pasta for over 20 years! This top menu item is a creamy linguine dish made with their house-made kimchi, bacon, secret spice, and packed with incredible flavor. You'll be blown away by the combination and the perfect balance of spices.In addition to their renowned pasta, Anju House offers a variety of other mouthwatering dishes. We highly recommend trying their Asado Plate, featuring perfectly grilled Argentinian short ribs served with chimichurri and a steak sauce for dipping. The flavors are rich and satisfying, making it a must-try for you meat lovers. For those craving something crispy and flavorful, the Korean Fried Chicken with Green Onion Salad is a winner. The chicken is perfectly fried to achieve a crispy exterior while maintaining juicy tenderness on the inside. This is paired with refreshing Green Onion Salad and a side of sweet chili sauce. To complement your meal, don't miss out on their in-house creation, Melona Soju. This unique beverage is made with the flavors of the popular Korean melon ice pop, resulting in a refreshing drink that perfectly complements the flavors of the dishes.Located in Koreatown, Anju House provides a cozy and inviting atmosphere, complete with a relaxing outdoor patio. Whether you're looking for a fun date night or a late-night hangout with friends, this is the perfect spot to enjoy exceptional food. We were pampered by Jason who provided the warmest service I've experienced in a very long time..</p>
<p>Wanted a late night bite and this place is open late. Mind you, the seating is outdoors and the outdoor heaters aren't that great. It reminds me of a backyard picnic. I think it was around 10pm that we dined in and it took me 10 minutes to get seated and that's because I walked all the way to the back to ask for a table. The food is okay. I've had better tteoboki and Korean dishes but like I've stated, it was late - I was hungry. They also service American food like burgers and animal style fries which are also okay. As far as ambience and crowd goes, it was a weekday and late and there was a table next to us with an extremely drunk girl. I normally wouldn't mind but she obviously needed to be cut off and sent home as she was falling off the chairs and being obnoxiously loud. Safe to say we ate and left quickly.</p>
<p>Thursday 8pmParking/Wait: They have a small parking lot with $3 valet. There is street parking but quite a bit of open spots when I went at night. No wait and my party of 2 was seated right away.Food/Drinks: Ordered the Miso Mushroom Pasta and the Seafood Risotto. Both were pretty solid 4/5. They have a wide variety of food here, and their menu is pretty huge. They also have quite a large drink selection (cocktails, beers, coffee, etc.). It is hard for places to have extremely good food quality when they have a huge menu, so I wonder if anything on their menu will give me that 5/5 food experience. But what I tried was still fine.Ambiance/Service: The inside of this place was very cute and comforting. They had some Christmas decorations in the front, and the back dining room had lots of large heat lamps to keep the place warm. Good service and food was out in about 10 minutes. Summary: Cute place in K-Town. This would be a good date spot. The food is pretty good, with a variety of Korean-American-Italian options.</p>
<p>Woah woah woah. Best place ever to come with your group of friends or for a chill date. Interior is SO BEAUTIFUL AND SPACIOUS. It doesn't even feel like a bar, more like an outdoor patio to hang out and chill. There are several patio heaters throughout the restaurant when it gets chilly, and a mosquito light zapper in the corner. Parking: Came around in an early evening and was able to find parking up ahead at one of the side streets. They now have a valet at the front and you are not able to park on the side parking lot (parking person will call the towing company).Okonomiyaki (Japanese savory pancake) was crispy and warm on the inside. My favorite dish out of the whole meal. There were savory octopus bits dancing and wafting on top of the pancake. Size was about two hands combined together. So worth, you'll devour it!Grilled corn was okay. Came in about 5-6 pieces?Spicy Jambong came with udon noodles, crab, mussels, bits of octopus and bok choy. For spice lovers, it's not going to be really spicy just enough to warm you up like Shin ramen. There was one dish that I couldn't recall it's name. Tasted similar to Japchae encompassing: veggies, noodles and sauce that mixed very well to altogether.</p>
<p>Good food, friendly service, & excellent ambience.Came here a few minutes after opening for early dinner. Wife & I were the only ones here for the first 30 mins then it started to fill up. Menu has tons of choices & even though I had researched it well before coming I still had a hard time choosing. Ultimately went with the Cheese Pork Cutlet & wife had the bulgogi burger.Would be a great place to hang with friends & drink but we had an early flight so it was not a late outing for us</p>
<p>Came for DineLA. Very filling!The DineLA menu is designed for two people so it was good that the server stopped us from ordering more dishes!  It's $35 per person and you have a selection of corn, a side dish, and a hearty main course to share with salad. The sides and corn dishes are unique and is not on the regular menu!You can also order dishes to share, ranging from small anju (like fries, musubi) or big anju (fried chicken, rice cakes) as well as selections of fried rice, noodles and soups. You can get reservations but we were seated pretty quickly lots of room. While there is "standard" and outdoor pretty much all the dining is outdoors to some extent, but well covered with heaters available. Bathrooms are clean. Valet is available for $4.  We just parked in the residential area one block walk away.</p>
<p>Ktown isn't as poppin as it used to. The restaurant seem to have valet-only without a parking lot, but we were able to find street parking nearby on a weekend during dinner time. This place is aesthetically pleasing with a lot of decor, under what seem to be a covered patio. It had a free Photo Booth that my friends really enjoyed! It had a bogo cocktail pitcher so we ordered a melona and yakult (most likely soju) cocktail which was a good amount for 4 people. The melona one was a bit sweet, but not bad !The kimchi pasta and carbonara was decent, just wished there were more meat. We were contemplating on the kimchi pasta or kimchi fried rice, we should've chose the fried rice. The garlic chicken was pretty good, but not garlicky enough unfortunately. We thought it was wings or boned but it was boneless, similar to orange chicken. We also ordered fried beef intestines, it was apparently a new item. It was just ok. I go to enough kbbq restaurant to cook my intestines. It just wasn't fried enough and it also came in such a small portion. I would suggest to use less oil, cut it in smaller pieces to make it crispier and to have it seem more on the plate. The garlic sauce that went with it was delicious though! Overall food isn't bad, but not amazing- just average. The cute ambience of the place is what makes it worth checking out!</p>
<p>Food was actually pretty good.They also had buy one get one free drink specials on a Saturday night.I liked their indoor/outdoor space. Would be good for large groups</p>
<p>I had higher expectations for Anju House given the location, reviews, and photos. Unfortunately, the visit was marred by a lack of customer service. Confusing instructions on seating, malfunctioning heat lamps, and a mix-up with our order left us disappointed. The attempt to serve us food from another table was unsanitary, and the overall experience was marked by a lack of attention from our original waiter. Doubtful about returning after this experience.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, yes, my boyfriend and I were looking for musubi, and came across this place. What a beautiful place to eat at, the ambiance is great and of course the food is better. We came in around 4, and we were seated fast. The server came and got our order, and we quickly received our drinks. Wouls definitely come back</p>
<p>No Fees</p>
<p>I was craving Korean food so my friend suggested to go to this place. I was excited to go since the owner posted that they were "dog friendly", and we could bring our fur babies. The place has a homey feel to it, like you're invited to go into someone's cutely decorated backyard. It was a nice day out so we really enjoy being outside in the patio area.Now to the food... we got Combo B that included the Asado Plate, corn cheese, fries, and a side salad. We also got the Korean fried chicken with green onions and the army stew. Everything was seasoned well and came out at a pretty good pace. We really love the Asado plate with the chimichurri sauce, but next time we order this, I would get the sauce on the side. We like the fried chicken, but wished it was with bone like a chicken wing or a chicken thigh because I think it would've been more flavorful. Also wish they served some white radish kimchi with the chicken, but the green onions were a good touch. Their fries were seasoned well and their corn cheese was delicious. Their army stew was pretty standard but paired nicely with the rest of the meal.All in all, I would recommend this place, if you're looking for a cozy little place with good food to eat with friends or looking for a spot to eat with your fur babies.</p>
<p>Just so incredibly disappointed. I was a huge fan of yellow house before so I came by to finally try it as Anju House. First impression, I was quite happy! The place was still very nice with plenty of plants and a cute homey feel inside with the decor. It was so cool that I felt like I could just hang out inside forever on a weekday with friends. Then my table ordered the chicken & fries combo, the penne carbonara, and the mushroom pasta. Which I think was all a mistake :( the chicken and fries were crispy and seasoned well, but not at all impressive by any means. The chicken was very much mostly just breading with little chicken inside and was dry.The penne carbonara was SICKENINGLY sweet I have never had a carbonara pasta taste just so sweet. I could not even finish it after the first couple bites. I was just so disappointed after seeing the rave reviews, but I think I just ordered something wrong instead of what was proven to good. I even had to ask the server if the carbonara was usually this sweet and they said no then proceeded to leave afterwards. I had to ask for salt and pepper on the side which unfortunately could not save this incredibly sweet pasta dish. The mushroom pasta even had the same taste where it was all just incredibly sweet to the point that not even salt or pepper could save it. Just a crazy amount of sweetness in dishes that I wasn't expecting to be sweet at all. Cocktails were a great deal though and were very yummy but were very weak which hey it's buy one get one free so I can't complain. Not a very good experience and I don't think I'll be coming back just at how sweet the food was to the point that it wasn't enjoyable. Not sure if it was a mistake or an off day but I don't think I'll be back to find out. So I warn everyone to watch out when coming here and to stick to the popular big anju items! Let my headache and upset stomach be a lesson that I hope you never have to experience</p>
<p>Food: 4 starsService: 5 starsAmbiance: 4-5 starsI recently learned that old Yellow House was changed to this new place. Went there on Thuraday night with a friend. Upon arrival, you will no loner see the "yellow" house since it's now blue colored house. I guess they made some interior changes, but honestly, it was very similar to Yellow House.As for the menu, I hadn't been to old Yellow House in a long time, so I can't really say if there's a big change. Ordered Anju House Dukboki, which seemed to be their popular dish. It was special that they had more than just the rice cake. However, it wasn't the Wow Dukboki. I would prefer Yupduk for Dukboki.</p>
<p>Very cute outdoor seating and the staff was very nice. Not much street parking but they do have a valet for a few dollars. No wait on a Saturday at 2pm. I recommend the Korean fried chicken with green onion. The chicken was boneless giant nuggets the size of Italian meatballs and they give you a lot. More breading to chicken ratio so you'll definitely have a food coma. The pickled vegetables were okay: pink radish, kimchi, and yellow cauliflower. The okonomiyaki wasn't great as it wasn't crispy and had too much mayo. It looks better than it tastes. Overall, definitely recommend coming here just because it's a cute area and they have a lot of dish varieties like pastas and soups.</p>
<p>We came here for the Asado Plate. Arrived and location is small with limited parking.The restaurant front looks like a little home. Walked in and through the hallway it opens up to a small lighted patio. Super cute and relaxing. It feels like you're sitting in your backyard.Came here on a Saturday night and Combo A with the Asado Plate was sold out. Sad and disappointed. All combos includes a pitcher of beer or bottle of Solju which we opted out to get.Ordered Combo B. We got Grilled Galbi, Budae Jigae and a Korean pancake. On the side we ordered Kimchi Bacon Pasta.3/5 - Combo B - To sum it up all the dishes was just okay.3/5 - Kimchi Bacon PastaAmbience was great until you have young adult kids drinking, cursing, FaceTiming and just being loud. The way I read the room that night was very quiet. It was hard to finish dinner without being interrupted. Maybe we might come back and try the Asado plate and in hopes it might change my review.</p>
<p>Love coming here. Even before they changed their name. I love the Kimchi bacon pasta! They got rid of some menu items but they kept the most popular so that's good! They have gender neutral restroom and if you're looking for a quiet place to study with nice aesthetics this is definitely a nice spot! Their service is quick and attentive!</p>
<p>Surprisingly did not meet expectations for me. As a former yellow house restaurant, I was hoping the quality of the food followed its predecessor - simple and delicious and never the wrong choice. But unfortunately, this place missed the mark on the food. It wasn't awful but it wasn't really memorable either. Ordered the kimchi pasta, spicy fried chicken, and cracked corn and I couldn't say any of it rocked my world. Service was okay and often had to flag people down more often and it wasn't very busy.</p>
<p>Was a big fan of Yellow House, so when I heard they reopened after some remodeling I had to come back for their signature kimchi bacon pasta because I am absolutely in love with it!!  (I even tried to make my own version but it just never hits like theirs) The pasta was so rich and creamy with the slight spice and savoriness of the kimchi - never disappoints. We also got the garlic furikake chicken which was nice and crunchy which was marinated in a likewise sweet/savory sauce. Ended it off with the fishcake stew which was nice and warm, one of my favorite anjus. Interior is cute as usual with all the decorative signs and even the outdoor seating is cozy and aesthetic. Service was very nice;  overall a great dining experience :))*edit: for parking they have valet for $3</p>
<p>If you're looking for a chill hangout spot, look no further. The decor is cute and the seating is all outdoors (covered), which lends to a laidback vibe - especially at night. Parking is valet or street parking only, but the valet is only $3. Staff is friendly. I wish I had gotten my server's name because he was incredibly helpful and took good care of my party. The food comes out pretty fast. They have a lot of options, and everything we ordered was delicious. The Bulgogi Dukboki is a must try - so savory and flavorful! The pickled veggies and green onions are fresh and delicious. The fried chicken is outstanding; it's crispy and not too salty. The cocktails are really good. The alcohol is barely noticeable, and they're not too sweet. Their hot teas are yummy as well.This place has definitely earned a spot on my go-to list!</p>
<p>The food is great and comes out in a good time. The garlic bread is my favorite part and the spicy sauce that comes out with the chicken is sweet and spicy which is a good break from just plain fried chicken. Perfect pairing with a terra beer! Service was great when we entered but some of the servers during our meal seemed a bit unfriendly. There are also a lot of flies fyi since you will be dining outside so we were swatting off a lot of flies. I think the ambiance would be a lot better at night also but we wanted to just quickly stop by and check out the rebrand after they switched from yellow house.</p>

<p>Visited L'Antica Pizzeria Da Michele before a matinee show at the Pantages theater. Tucked away in what seems like a former residence, it's a bit off the beaten path in Hollywood, but well-marked signs guide you there. Valet parking is available, which is handy given the location.On a Friday afternoon, the place was moderately busy, but we were seated quickly at the bar. The wait staff was attentive, and on their recommendation, we switched our order from pasta to pizza. This turned out to be an excellent choice. The pizza dough was exceptional - thin, chewy, and glutinous, just like in Italy, topped with eggs, Guanciale, and possibly ricotta. It was a melt-in-your-mouth experience.We also tried the steak salad, which was fresh and beautifully prepared, with the steak cooked perfectly to medium. The visit left us eager to return and explore more of their pizza offerings.</p>
<p>Came here on my boyfriend's birthday on a Tuesday to surprise him with a nice Italian dinner. I was super excited, made reservations far in advance and of course put in a request to sit outside in the cute backyard patio area, and was looking forward to it. The experience, though, was not really a good one. We got to our 6pm reservation on time. Walked up to the host, told him we had a reservation, and he was just SOOO dismissive to us the entire time, not nice at all. He led us to a little table right near the front door, and kind of just dumped us there. As he was leaving, I asked "oh is there any way to get a table outside?" and without any explanation or anything he just said "no" rudely and walked away. Fine, I get it, a request is not guaranteed and I respect that, but I do not appreciate being treated like crap at a nice restaurant. We sat down upset, and to make things worse: the table was wobbly. Also while we were sitting there waiting for our server, we could see and hear customers who came in AFTER US ask to be seated outside and the host said "No problem!" and walked one party to sit out there and to a another party he was at least kind enough to say "there's no availability outside and there won't be for maybe 45 minutes." I wish he had taken the time to at least tell us something like that versus just writing us off. Anyways.. We waited like 5-10 minutes for our server to finally walk up to our table, where I then told them our table was wobbly and we would like to move. Our server was kind and said she would see what was available, then walked off. Then about 2 minutes later, the rude host walks over to us and says "oh a table just opened up in the outside patio are let me take you there now." Keep in mind again, we were sitting near the only front/exit door, so we know NO ONE had left while we were sitting down. So he definitely lied and just didn't want to give us the outdoor seating in the first place??? And when we got outside, there were plenty of open tables. I wish I got that male host's name that was working on Tuesday 11/21 ~6pm because man, he ruined the entire experience for us. Our new server came over and was nice, took our order, and was attentive enough. Drinks were good, food was good, however birthday was not acknowledged even though I said it was his birthday, but I think overall the service we got in the beginning put a bad taste on the experience from the beginning and was enough to keep us from coming back here. Service REALLY matters, especially when you're the first person customers are interacting with. I wish we could've had a better experience or I wish I took my boyfriend somewhere else for his birthday, but what's done is done and at least the drinks were enjoyable.</p>
<p>Came here for an early dinner before a show at the Hollywood Bowl and had a good time! We sat in their enclosed patio outside which is nice and has lights, heaters, and a cute fireplace. We parked in a structure nearby but they also have valet parking available.We ordered:- orange wine- shirley temple- caesar salad- cacio e pepe pasta- pesto pizzaEverything was delicious! Service was fairly slow but it was okay because this is a good restaurant to hang out and have conversation. Great option if you're in the area and if you have a show at the Hollywood Bowl to catch!</p>
<p>Came here after watching a show at the Dolby for a late night dinner.  Pulled up to valet across the street and the Attendant wanted to make sure we had a reservation and that the kitchen was still open since we got there around 10pm.  The posted closing time on Yelp was midnight so we were fine. We didn't have a reservation but we were seated quickly and waitress was very attentive.  Of course after reading all the reviews, we ordered the margarita pizza added the prosciutto and arugula.  Wow this tasted soooo good.  Crust was super thin, sauce was so tasty and the combination of toppings hit the spot.    Even though we probably could have just stuck with pizza, the pastas sounded delicious so ordered both the pappardelle genovese and the bolognese tagliatelle.   I liked the bolognese better as the pappardelle had a sweeter sauce.  Overall very delighted with dinner, service and ambiance.</p>
<p>This restaurant is a chain of the famous restaurant in Naples, Italy. Since I had tried the location in Naples, I wanted to see what's the difference. And I can tell this Hollywood location caters to the Angelenos because they add a lot of extra toppings while in Italy, pizza is very simple. Food was delicious. Pizza was authentic Italian and flavorful. I loved how the pizza dough was thin yet chewy and fluffy. My only callouts were the dough was a bit undercooked and the pizza had extra toppings of cheese that really wasn't needed and felt a bit heavy since there already was globs of cheese at the bottom. Grilled octopus was delicious. Squid ink pasta with seafood was very tasty but a bit spicy for my palette. If you have heartburn or indigestion, you might wanna avoid this dish. Calamari was also yummy, crunchy and perfectly battered. Branzino entree was excellent with clean flavors.  Service was very nice. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. Orders came out on time and paced well. Ambiance is an interesting mix of modern contemporary and classic. Courtyard is lovely with fireplace and lights while the patio was just typical outdoor simple modern. I would definitely come back here again and try new dishes.</p>
<p>Food is AMAZING! Celebrated my partner and I's anniversary! In the past for to go: We have ordered a double margarita to go before, and it was literally eaten within 15min because it was so good.   this made us come in for our anniversary! We ordered the Truffle Pizza (real truffles as is) and the quality and flavor is worth every penny. We also ordered the beet pizza which balanced the dish. The flavors are incomparably fresh , flavorful, and complimentary of one another. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! The ambience is beautiful. Good date night. Service was little slow overall - definitely professional and made the night wonders. The server was very knowledgeable and kind. It seemed busier for a week night since we sat around waiting for a bit between water/drinks, food, and dessert. Everyone here from the hosts to the busser/food runners were very kind and helpful. They did take care of our desserts for our anniversary which was very sweet! Definitely coming back!</p>
<p>Went on a Saturday night. Very vibe and atmosphere was great, food was amazing and delicious, and the staff were friendly and nice! We got 2 drinks, 2 appetizers, and a pizza - our total was $140. Will def go back.</p>
<p>My brother raved about this restaurant that he first had in Italy so while we were visiting LA, we thought we'd give this location a try. It probably goes without saying that parking is a challenge. Inside, the place is trendy, very "LA" - not sure how to describe that vibe. Initially, our table was very dim, but we asked for a light to be brought over.The food overall was yummy. Solid pizza, I loved the mushroom tortellini, and the pumpkin panna cotta was good too. I think the pizza was authentic, the crust was fantastic. However, one of our pizzas was missing the toppings on an entire half (see photo). For its price, I expected more.Update after the business response: We did bring up the sloppy pizza to our waitress. She laughed and joked about it, like "what was the kitchen doing with that one?" Honestly, I was dining with family so it wasn't a big deal for us to pick up the tomatoes and spread the cheese around more evenly. But it doesn't change the fact that this was an unprofessional presentation. And I don't appreciate the business owner assuming we didn't bring it up then and there. We did. Nothing was done to address the issue.</p>
<p>One of the best pizzas in LA! Absolutely everything on their menu is delicious! Their appetizers, salads and sides, you can't go wrong with anything you order here! The restaurant is beautiful, ideal for date, night, special occasions, or simple lunch with friends!service is exceptional, very friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient! You can see the pizzas being made, and the care they put into each and every one of their products. High-quality ingredients, make it worth the splurge, highly recommended!</p>
<p>Ambiance 5/5The ambiance of this place is wonderful! You wouldn't think such a place can be found in such a gritty area of Hollywood but lo and behold such a place does exist and is tucked away nicely and transports you into another realm when you pass the gates and into the restaurant.  My friend and I came by here for lunch and I was impressed with the atmosphere and can only imagine how much more impressive it would be when it's evening time.Food 5/5Wood fired pizza in and of itself can't be beat but wood fired pizza like the ones they have here are on a whole other level! Wonderful flavor and texture! My friend and I decided on the Diavola and added burrata cheese as an extra. If you just look the photo of the pizza, you can tell that they are strict about keeping an eye on the pizza during the entire time it's in the oven because of how evenly cooked it is. Just a note, if you're not a fan of pizza with a thin crust, you may find you'll have a change of heart after having their pizza.We also had their Linguine Pescatora. It may sound harsh but I wish I ordered another pizza instead because this dish was not on the same level as their pizza and really missed the mark. The flavor of the sauce was good, nothing special, but the shrimp, clam, calamari and mussel were a bit over cooked and were on the chewy/rubbery side. Maybe this was an off day but I don't think I would take a chance with the pasta the next time I have a meal here. Service 2/5This is the only category that really missed the mark. Our server was not very enthusiastic or friendly. It felt like she was mildly disinterested at best. I don't really ask for much when getting service at a restaurant but a warm smile goes a long way and saying THANK YOU when bringing the bill can put a cherry on top. All this woman did was take our order, pass by once to see how the food was all with a forced smile. At the end of the meal, she placed the bill on the table and walked away without saying a word. Maybe she was having a bad day? All I can say is the guy who brought the food to our table, cleared our table and brought the box for the leftover was much friendlier and made us feel appreciated as customers. Looking back on it now, since I paid my bill with cash, I should have given him most of the tip. I'm hoping they all split it evenly but I have a feeling our server is going to keep most of it for herself. In conclusion, the pizza was delicious and the dining atmosphere was wonderful even with the tepid service. Regardless, I would definitely come back again to do a dinner there!</p>

<p>L'antica Pizzeria da Michele is a true Italian gem nestled in the heart of Los Angeles. From the moment you step in, the aroma of authentic pizza fills the air. Let's talk about their Margherita pizza; it's not just good, it's exceptional! In fact, it stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the revered pizzas from Bestia and Desano. The balance of flavors, the freshness of ingredients, and the perfect crust make it an absolute delight.Now, the Chicken Scaloppina - an absolute winner. The chicken is tender, cooked to perfection, and the lemony sauce is a burst of flavors that's hard to forget. The recommended pairing with the Menabrea La Bionda beer enhances the experience to another level.And then there's the Tortino Al Cioccolato - a true decadent delight. Each bite feels like a taste of heaven, and when accompanied by a scoop of vanilla ice cream, it's simply sublime.What adds to the experience is the charming ambience. If you're lucky enough to snag a spot outside near the pizza table, you'll have a front-row seat to the mesmerizing dance of the talented chefs crafting these delicious pizzas.Plus, for convenience, they offer valet parking, making it hassle-free to visit. However, street parking is also available nearby, giving you options based on your preference.L'antica Pizzeria da Michele isn't just a meal; it's an experience. An authentic slice of Italy right in Los Angeles. Highly recommended for anyone seeking an exquisite taste of Italy's culinary finesse.</p>
<p>Service here seems rushed.Street and valet parking available.Ambiance is very LA, different from their Naples location.The food was good overall.My biggest ding is the pesto pizza you can see all the toppings slid towards one side. Not very professional in the execution.The pizza crust has more of a burnt taste than the Italian version.It's good and I crave Italian pizza once in awhile. But not sure I'll frequent.</p>
<p>I've never been so excited about pizza. I'm not the biggest pizza fan but me & my fiancé couldn't stop talking about how tasty the pizza here is. Now I can't wait to try the other ones on the menu. We ordered the classic margherita pizza with prosciutto, and everything from the sauce to the crust was.. *chefs kiss* we were both like, "I wanna become one with this pizza" lol. We also ordered their cacio e pepe (cheese & pepper pasta). Super simple yet also tasty. I loved the firmness (yet chewy enough) of the pasta.We sat in the secret garden with our server Drew. It was a bit more quiet outside but we honestly didn't mind it since we were able to hear each other talk. The ambiance of the inside was lively and fun though, but I would choose to sit outside if you want a more intimate dinner. Our server was sweet and friendly, and he's from TX like us! We'll be regulars here so hopefully we'll get to try almost every item on the menu :)</p>
<p>Came here on a Friday Night - parking is pretty much only valet or your parking on in not so nice areas and walking. The food was pretty good - the Brussels sprouts were bomb! Not pictured was the pesto pasta and the lemon chicken (I forgot the name). Both entrees were pretty good. Chicken 5/5 and pesto pasta 4/5. I got the alpine spritz as my drink and the "alpine" part was some what over powering, it really tasted like I was drinking an alpine tree. Not for me but the name / description of drink does match the taste so I can knock it. Ambiance is very cute and staff was friendly.</p>
<p>Heard this place had great pizza so decided to check it out.Meatballs: the meatballs were small and okay. But the sauce here is the true hero.Neapolitan pizza: the crust was phenomenal as was the toppings. With that said, this may be controversial but the core of the pizza was paperrrrr thin. It made it watery and had the toppings sliding off of it to and fro.Cacio e pepe: was told this is best with truffles but the truffles were slightly overpowering. The pasta was cooked perfectly and it was delicious just wish we would have gotten it without truffles.Nice date night location. Intimate, a tad loud, but definitely cool.There's indoor seating, a bar, and two patios. Service was fast and friendly.They have valet parking but also didn't have problem with street just had to walk a few blocks. There's a parking garage near it but it has odd hours so didn't risk it.</p>
<p>My family and I had a wonderful last dinner in LA at L'Antica pizzeria, which was conveniently located in Hollywood very close to our hotel. The surrounding area isn't very nice, so I recommend driving there, though there is street parking if you search around for it. They also have valet, but it was quite expensive at $14. The restaurant is very beautiful, with beautiful outdoor dining and string lights, as well as very nice indoor dining. It is great for a romantic date night, or a celebration. One thing I really liked about this restaurant was that the noise level wasn't too loud, but it was a quiet buzz in the background, so you didn't feel like it was too quiet. The food was incredible! We ordered the Bianca pizza, diavola pizza, and Pappadelle Genovese pasta. All were exceptional! I had no idea the pizza would be as large as it was! It was a large size pizza with eight slices, easily enough for two people. Each pizza was around $24 to $34. The pasta was outstanding and we gobbled it up quickly. They served us gelato with a candle as we were celebrating a birthday, which was a very nice touch! Overall, I would love to eat here again and it was one of the best pasta experiences I've ever had. 5/5, totally recommend!</p>
<p>I came here to celebrate a friend's birthday that lives nearby. I'll start by mentioning the pizza here is phenomenal, 5/5 would come here just for the pizza over everything! Amazing service, beautiful ambiance (particularly the patio area), and strong drinks too. It is a little pricey for the quantity of food (but it is going for a high-end Italian angle), you definitely leave feeling full though. Below is the breakdown per dish:5/5 - Margarita Pizza: simple, super thin, pure unadulterated classic Italian pizza, a must order if you're coming here. ($22)5/5 - Roasted Cauliflower: super creamy, VERY tasty! Literally this and the pizza are the best items on the menu by far! ($20)4/5 - Tagliatelle Pesto: solid pesto and earthy flavors, a decent size although it doesn't initially feel like it. Not an amazing pasta, but pretty good. ($27)4/5 - Pappardelle Genovese: a hearty pasta that is well made. Once again, good quality, but nothing exceptional. ($32)5/5 - Lemon Tart: the perfect (small) lemony treat to hit the sweet and tangy flavor palette. ($16)5/5 - Carrot Cake Slice: wow, such a delicious and sugar forward piece of one of my favorite desserts. Loved everything about this except maybe the price. ($22)4/5 - Drinks: a couple different drinks, all were decently made and strong, so that was good!Food: 4.5/5Service: 5/5Ambiance: 4.5/5Value: 3.5/5Overall: 4.33/5</p>
<p>I stopped by this place for a friends birthday and was delighted with the food and experience. Haven't been working in Hollywood for a while but was happy to stop by a familiar place for our friends birthday. The place looked real nice, with some tables even having touch lights. The parking is going to be $12  valet across the street unless you can find some street parking. There are certain places if you are lucky for free street parking after a certain time. FoodI was able to try multiple different appetizers and food, but one thing for certain, their Pizza, no matter which one we tried was really good. All of their craft drinks like old fashioned seem to be the same price. The short rib pasta I had was good, I just wished I remembered the names, unless you speak the language, going to be hard to remember. Bit far for me for pizza but I think it is a good spot to hang out with friends or bring a date. Until next time !</p>
<p>My friend asked if we wanted to grab some pizza after a show, and then directed us here. I was expecting a casual slice shop, but this is definitely more of a special occasion place. Additionally, it's the world famous Da Michele from Naples, which serves the best Neopolitan pizza in the world and was featured in the movie Eat Pray Love. Talk about an understatement from my pal.This location offers a beautiful atmosphere and excellent service and is open late. We ordered pizza and pasta on our recent visit. They use fior di latte rather than the usual buffalo mozzarella for a different authentic pizza experience. Also, the pies are humongous, if you compare by American standards -- their sizes are more on par with the large sizes that you get when you're in Italy. The wood fired crust here is perfection -- so delicately thin and yet not soggy in the middle. Perfectly chewy edges and as close as it gets to eating pizza in Naples.The pasta is housemade and comes in a nice generous portion, which I didn't expect. We also tried salad (generous portions!) and dessert.We're so lucky to have L'Antica right here in LA/Hollywood. I can't wait to go back and have more authentic Neopolitan pizza.Parking: only valet is available on site at the restaurant. Do NOT park in the structure across the street that has a "public parking" sign. Even though it looks OK, they lock it up without warning after a certain hour and it's impossible to get your car out. You can see that many people make this mistake as there are signs of fence/gate break-ins. There are many phone numbers you can try but no one will be able to help you. If you find yourself in this bad situation with your car locked up, the only thing you can do is hope that one of the restaurant workers parked their car in there and is coming off shift but you might have to wait late into the night for this to happen.</p>
<p>LAPDM is Da place!It took five tries eating at LAPDM to snap me out and push me to write a much deserved review. I guess I just needed to try more dishes and confirm that LAPDM is as legit as they come.My apologies for keeping this jewel to myself for this long. A place that is a neighbor to the Catalina Bar & Grill has to be respected and looked at as a true contender for the best pizza in LA and possibly some of the best pasta in LA!LAPDM has been consistently great with the service, good and ambience.I would recommend the following: Fools Gold Drink, Grill Octopus, Beet Salad, Diavola Pizza, TAGLIATELLE BOLOGNESE and for dessert: FRITTELLE DI FRANKIE.However, I'm sure that anything and everything on the menu would be greatly appreciated and fully satisfying.Very few restaurants have consistently been as exciting and fresh as LAPDM.Bon Appetit!</p>

<p>Great food, great service. Kenan is an awesome bartender! I think it's a good sign for any restaurant that A) has employees working there long term and B) they can recognize customers like myself who only visit every few months. Friendly staff all around, makes the parking situation worth the effort. The pasta primavera is divine. The lemon donut is next level. 10/10</p>
<p>The food is absolutely delicious, ambiance is cute and prices are great! Perfect spot for date night or even a birthday celebration dinner. Service is always friendly and there's also a great bar across the street for after dinner drinks!</p>
<p>Been here 3x now and I am still coming back. It's the PERFECT italian spot. Most Italian places are real fast food type or super boujie ( have no flavor) but this is the perfect in between! The ambiance is still very nice for a date night but also welcome for a dinner with friends as well! They renovated and the aesthetic is modern Tuscan like! This is one of the spots where the food is just as good as the ambiance!! I LOVE THE PASTAS! I've had 4 of them and I'm constantly conflicted when I go back with what I want! It's fresh and packed with flavor!!! Amazing sauce to pasta proportions and the pasta is cooked to perfection! This place is truly underrated. I could literally be a spokesperson for this place with the Amount of ppl I have brought here and helped them rediscover it or find their go to Italian spot. And the service is always so attentive. Also the pricing for this place beats any Italian restaurant in LA based on the quality portions and service. The perfect price for the healthy portion, packed with fresh and good quality ingredients! The pesto fettuccine : is SO FLAVORFUL! Has a perfect pesto flavor with a creamy texture and hint of sundries tomato tang which is so well balanced! The texture of the pasta is outstanding and I could eat this everyday!!  Rigatoni vodka: STAR OF THE SHOW! This dish is not you're typical vodka sauce pasta it has soooo much more  flavor you can taste the garlic with tomato and creamy sauce texture is such a delight. The rigatoni is also perfect with the consistency of the sauce! The truffle ravioli: such a well balanced plate the truffle was not over powering but went really well with the light sauce! If you want a good ravioli this one is it! The portion was very healthy too we had to pack it!! The cacio de Pepe: AMAZING flavor! I loved the texture of the pasta and it's a dish you can't get bored of it's simple but so satisfying you just want to keep eating it! You can't go wrong with it as a safe dish if you want to have a simple plate.</p>
<p>An absolute gem that deserves every ounce of praise. My experience was nothing short of exceptional! from The moment we stepped in, we were greeted by a friendly hostess. There was no wait, we were seated immediately. The ambiance was a perfect blend of cozy and vibrant vibes.Their waffles were perfectly crisp on the outside and fluffy inside. They offer a variety of toppings, but i opted to keep it simple. The pineapple mimosas were a delightful twist, refreshing and had the perfect balance of juice and champagne.What truly sets this place apart is its staff. Our waitress was nothing short but Attentive, friendly, and quick, ensuring a seamless dining experience. She was full of personality and enthusiasm. From their scrumptious food to the delightful beverages, and their fantastic team with impeccable customer service  it was an overall delectable brunch.</p>
<p>Finally tried the last of the trifecta of the She/He restaurants on La Brea. The She/He trifecta (not an official label) are a series of three restaurants owned by a lovable power couple and they are all pretty much next door to each other-- Met her at the a (brunch and lunch spot), Her Thai (specializing in street Thai food) and Met Him at a Bar (Italian pasta).The restaurant is a corner restaurant, right across the way from Met her at a Bar. The ambiance is cozy enough for friends to catch up as well as romantic enough for a casual date.The food absolutely delicious. My friend had the Uncle Vinny's Branzino - breaded  branzino with a tomato and quinoa salad. The fish filet was light and flaky with the flavor being fresh and citrusy. The quinoa salad's taste was also refreshing and plays really well with the fish. I ordered the Lobster Spaghettone and I melted in my seat after the first bite. The sauce was creamy but did not over power the dish as some dishes I do. They were generous with the lobster as well! I would definitely order this !The calamari here is great with a light batter. The meatball app is also good but very filling. In fact, we were pretty full from the apps alone!Our server was friendly and charming. He was very knowledgeable of wine and helped us paired a nice white chardonnay with our meal. Met Him at a Bar is certainly a gem that can easily land on people's favorite spots to eat.</p>
<p>I am a huge fan of breakfast @ Met Her At A Bar, so I was very excited to try Met Him for dinner for my first time. I am happy to report that I was not let down, it was a terrific dinner. We had 7PM Saturday reservations and were able to be seated right when we arrived slightly early for our reservation. Parking in the area can be a bit tricky because the neighborhoods on both sides of La Brea require permits to park and there are limited metered spots on La Brea. The easiest thing to do is to park in the parking garage attached to Lassen's, next to All Seasons Brewing. Met Him is designed well on the inside, it's bright and open and not cramped at all. I appreciated the space in between tables, too many places cram people in so that it's hard to get in/out of the table plus hard to have a private conversation. Our server was very polite and prompt, she did a great job.You can add truffles to any dish for $20! A wonderful option that we certainly took advantage of for our dinner. We started off with the Heirloom Tomato Salad, which was wonderful and fresh. The dressing was so good I ate it with a spoon after the veggies were gone. Next came the Steamed Clams, which has been a favorite dish of mine since childhood, so it was great to have their version. The size isn't too large, and would be easy to finish for one person. For our entrees we chose two pastas and added truffles to both. We ordered the Truffle Cacio e Pepe and a special for the evening: Lobster Spaghettone with Truffles. Both were absolutely delicious and we easily finished both. The truffles were a great addition and I would recommend adding for any truffle fanOverall a fabulous casual Italian dinner in a fun part of town. It's a bit expensive, but not overly. I would confidently recommend to anyone looking for a great Italian dinner. This location is especially nice for a date or dinner with friends/family.</p>
<p>Very cute dinner spot and bar! My brother and I came here after work for a small bite. We shared the rigatoni vodka, heirloom tomato salad, spa drink (cocktail), and tiramisu for dessert. We felt the portions could be a bit bigger for the price but otherwise everything was delicious. Service was amazing. We sat at the bar and everyone was so generous with their service making sure we were good.</p>
<p>Came here for brunch with some friends, instead of met him at a bar. Menu was pretty similar per the waiters as they are sister restaurants. Friendly service, food was ok/decent for brunch, super cute inside decoration. Loved the open space/light in the decor.</p>
<p>We came on a weekend evening and luckily were able to snag a spot without a reservation. It gets very busy at peak hours, and it's a little loud fyi if you're sensitive to that. We shared the arancini appetizer, rigatoni vodka with 2 added meatballs, and truffle ravioli. The arancini comes with 1 big ball so plan ahead to share. The food was great and the service was nice too. It wasn't the best Italian I've ever had, but definitely a good spot if you're in the area.</p>
<p>Went for DineLA week and it was delicious! Glad we made reservations because it got super busy at like 8pm on a Saturday with a line around the corner. Service was great, everyone was helpful and quick. I had the calamari, rigatoni vodka, and tiramisu. The calamari and tiramisu were good, but I would return soley for the rigatoni vodka. Definitely one of the best pastas I ever had. Pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was soo good. Cute date spot. Parking was terrible as expected, we did valet for convenience which was $14 with cash, more if by card.</p>
<p>No Fees</p>
<p>It's alright, nothing to write home about.Made a reservation via Resy. Unfortunately, we were late and ran 5 mins over the 15 min grace period so they cancelled our reservation, which is fair. Ambience/vibe and service wasn't too welcoming or warm either. We were seated at the bar and someone came to check in 10-15 mins later. We asked about having the dine LA menu to go because we weren't hungry at that hour but still wanted to try it but they refused so we ordered it for dine in. They refused to get it all at once and wanted to course it out painfully.Drinks were ok, nothing spectacular or what you'd expect for a restaurant with bar culture in the title/mission. Even the bar seating isn't comfortable, without backrest and while this isn't a point of contention, it doesn't align with their whole idea that little wonderful things are supposed to start at bar.</p>
<p>I've been hearing amazing things about this place for a while. I decided to try it out and ordered delivery from there.I was happy to see gluten free pasta options on their menu. I ordered the garlic shrimp appetizer, it was delicious, and a generous por. I also got the bolognese and asked for gluten free pasta. It was a big underwhelming, it wasn't bad at all but was a bit plain, and the portion size was on the smaller side.</p>
<p>Fantastic pasta and appetizers. Got the Bruschetta and Fried Calamari as apps which were both delicious. For pastas, we ordered the Rigatoni Vodka, Squid Ink Frutti Di Mare, and the Truffle Cacio E Pepe. Out of the three, I'd say the Cacio E Pepe was my favorite.The service was attentive enough. They would come in and out to check up on us, but sometimes they'd be nowhere to be seen. That might be because we were seated outside, though.The place is small and cute. Would recommend for any occasion, GNO or date night! Definitely would come back.</p>
<p>My party of three came to MHAAB for brunch on Saturday.  As a side note, they serve similar breakfast items at the breakfast location Met Her at a Bar.  Him has a much larger interior so this is a great choice of the line at Her is too long.The food was fantastic.  We had a Chicken and Waffle, Mama's Omelette, and a breakfast burrito.  We rounded it out with coffee and orange juice.  It all tasted delicious and came out hot.We arrived right at opening time of 10 AM and it was relatively empty.  By 11 AM it was packed, so earlier will favor larger or hungrier parties.</p>
<p>One word: wow! From the moment we checked in, we were greeted with a smile, and of the utmost politeness. Our waiter was the best! This was my girlfriends and I first time here and he was so patient with us: from the drinks, to the appetizers, entree, and dessert, he never once gave off a vibe of impatience, or rudeness, instead, he gave us his patience, and honest answers when it came to our questions of the menu. Favorite drink: paid time off Appetizer: Zuppa di mussels, calamari- their sauce was amazingggg Entree: truffle ravioli Dessert: flourless chocolate cake. Everything is made in house, and everything was delicious. Definitely, definitely will be back.</p>
<p>Decided to dine here spontaneously before hitting up All Season Brewing and was happily pleased! We came on a Monday night around 7pm and were seated right away. They have valet parking available or there are streets nearby (watch out for the signs posted on some). The ambiance was super cute, but not too fancy. You could definitely dress nice casual or casual. Food was also delicious! The calamari was nicely portioned and crispy (8.5/10), meatball sandwich with side salad was delightful and super filling (8/10), and vodka pasta was great (7/10). Pricing is pretty standard LA prices (~$20/dish). Staff was super nice and service was quick. Overall would definitely come back!</p>
<p>Went on a Saturday at 5PM. My friend made a reservation for 3 about a week in advance. We got seated quickly and was immediately greeted by our server. We ordered the truffle fries and Brussel sprouts for appetizers and took some time to look over the menu for drinks and entrees. The truffle fries were delicious and fresh, brussel sprouts crispy and flavorful. We ordered drinks and entrees at the same time. We actually got our entrees before we got our drinks, which was a little odd since the place wasn't that busy. For drinks, I got their orange wine and my friends got a guava margarita (not on the menu) and the flower power. I enjoyed my orange wine and my friend enjoyed her margarita. The flower power was definitely a different taste. For entrees we got the rigatoni vodka with a meatball, truffle ravioli with sausage and bolognese with a meatball. We all enjoyed our food. I was hesitant to order the ravioli because they usually come with 5 at most Italian restaurants, but it came with a good amount! I added sausage because there's no meat in the dish usually. It paired well together and I'd get it again. The truffle taste wasn't overpowering and I was full after. My friends enjoyed their pastas. The bolognese with the meatball was a little too much meat for my friend, which could be a good thing since they gave a lot in the sauce.Overall a solid place, service could be a little quicker but we enjoyed!</p>
<p>Great pasta. The food leaves nothing to be desired. It's classy, flavorful, and doesn't take itself too seriously. The service was quick and efficient. I loved the atmosphere as well. You'll pay a bit of a premium, but in my opinion the meal was worth every penny.</p>
<p>What a great little spot! Adorable restaurant with good food and fantastic service! We came for happy hour and can't wait to come back again for dinner! Try the meatballs! It's delicious. Parking would be my biggest complaint. Make sure to read the signs if you park in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>My new date spot! I've always heart about this place but hasn't had a chance to go and wow was I missing out. I went on a Monday night and the place was buzzing. I love a great energy in a restaurant and that's what this place had. Food was amazing and will definitely be in my rotation. Service was a little spotty at times, but it did seem VERY busy when we came, so won't hold too much against them. The dim lights also made it a great date spot in my opinion. Can't wait to go back</p>

<p>Hangari Kalguksu is a Korean noodle restaurant that has been on my radar for a very long time. I finally made it here on a weekend in November and wish I came earlier because the food here was superb. My husband got here around 1 pm on a Saturday. I got here later and the staff wouldn't seat him until I was there. There was a giant line at lunch time, so the place is clearly popular. The restaurant is in a strip mall so I wasn't expecting it to be nice inside, but the ambiance was pretty modern and trendy. We were brought water and menus immediately. The staff came around quickly to take our orders and we didn't have to wait long to get our food. Kalguksu is a Korean noodle dish that means knife-cut. I ordered the spicy seafood Kalguksu and was very happy with it. The noodles were fresh with a nice chewy texture. I could tell they'd been handmade. The seafood was fresh and the soup was actually quite spicy. They had a variety of different Kalguksu noodles on the menu, including meat and seafood varieties. My husband got the beef bulgogi but he regretted not getting one of the noodle dishes when he tasted mine. I do think the bulgogi here was very good but the noodles are their speciality. The service was friendly but pretty brisk. There was a line of customers outside the whole time we were eating so it's not a place you can really eat and linger even though the ambiance is nice. I'll definitely be back and would recommend coming here if you're craving a hot bowl of noodles.</p>
<p>So many good restaurants in Ktown, so little time, money, and stomach space. With a tight schedule on LA trips, you KNOW that I make each meal count. Hangari Kalguksu (as well as its neighbor Yangji Gamjatang), are frequent haunts for me. I dropped by with a friend for lunch a few Fridays ago for massive, steaming bowls of kalguksu, perfect for a chilly day. My friend and I got the spicy seafood kalguksu and the chicken kalguksu. Service was pretty quick and attentive. The chicken one literally came with half a chicken, and the meat was so tender, even the chicken breast!! The noodles were hand-cut with great texture, and the soup was absolutely addicting and perfectly thick. I loved the added black pepper and green onion, which complemented the rich soup nicely. I normally like my noodle soups spicy, but this one was perfectly stick-to-your-ribs hearty, and I didn't miss spice at all. The seafood soup was spicy and had a good kick without being agonizing. With hot liquid, adding too much spice makes the dish too painful for me to eat, but this one was perfectly balanced. I think I preferred the chicken kalguksu more, but the seafood kalguksu was still a very good dish with tons of seafood including squid, shrimp, and half a crab.Prices have gone up since COVID but their portions are also huge. My friend and I were stuffed but still had leftovers to take to-go. There isn't only a ton of noodles, but oodles of vegetables as well. Definitely one of my favorite kalguksu places in LA!</p>
<p>During my recent visit to Hangari Kalguksu noodle shop in Koreatown LA, I experienced a somewhat of a wait and line, especially during peak hours. However, the efficient and fast customer service helped alleviate any frustration.I opted for the beef bulgogi rice dish, but I found it to be on the salty side. Despite this, the other offerings, particularly the noodles, were exceptional. The noodle dishes showcased a delightful combination of flavors and textures, making them a standout feature of the menu.The ambiance of the restaurant was inviting, providing a cozy setting for a casual meal. The staff's attentiveness and quick service stood out positively, contributing to an overall pleasant dining experience. Despite the minor setback with the salty beef bulgogi, the variety of well-executed noodle dishes makes Hangari Kalguksu a notable spot in Koreatown LA.</p>
<p>It's always a good time when you're at Hangari. I've tried the chicken kalguksu which is delicious, but my friends and I decided to try the seafood kalguksu today with the large bossam to top it off. The seafood kalguksu was packed with clams, mussels, shrimp, and crab ~ very satisfying but I'm more of a chicken gal so I'll probs opt for it next time I come. The star of the show was surprisingly the bossam, it was amazing! Props to the chefs for cooking the pork belly so well - it was very flavorful and tender, I would recommend for larger groups. Since none of us have a huge appetite, it was plenty for the 5 of us. The interior is modern and great for catching up with friends/smaller groups. The only minus is that street parking is a little tough to find depending on when you come in the day, but there is valet parking available as well!</p>
<p>This bowl of chicken kalguksu was the deciding factor in choosing my ultimate favorite comfort food: chicken noodle soup. The noodles were so springy and I love knife-cut noodles because the bounciness adds so much texture. The broth was rich but in a refreshing way and was so good for my soul. I wish it came with more chicken though because the ratio of noodles to chicken was a little disheartening. That said, I would come over and over again just for this soup.</p>
<p>This place has so many reviews! And for a good reason. I'll just touch base on a couple things. The way goes by pretty quickly, so don't be intimidated by the line, they also take your order while you are in line. They are very efficient with cleaning up tables, seating people, serving food, etc. The portions here are large, we actually just ordered one item and shared between two people and it was just enough food.  I noticed people would order two items maybe one per person and a lot of people are taking left overs home. If you like clams, definitely try the clams it it is so delicious!</p>
<p>I didn't need a reservation for a group of three on a week night. We were seated right away. They brought us water, chopsticks, spoons, bowls, and napkins. After we ordered, they gave us side dishes, which were really good! Between three people, we shared three dishes: sujebi $16.99 (handmade "dough flakes"), bossam $45.99 (medium), and yulmu bibimguksu $16.99 (spicy cold noodles, no broth). All three dishes were sooo goood. Goddamn. I'm salivating thinking about them. Sujebi - perf for cold night. Soup is tasty. Noodle cake (?) (as opposed to calling it a rice cake lol) is chewy. Delicious veggies. We paid $1 to make it extra spicy, and it was def spicy! Bossam - fatty pork, raw garlic, lettuce, add the pickled radish and some sauce. Mmmmmm. Yulmu Bibimguksu - tasted sweet but delicious noodles and thin cold cucumber slices. Service was good. They refilled our water pitcher a couple times. They took away our empty dishes. They even refilled our side dishes when we asked. They bring the check to you. No bell system that I could see. Parking: the private lot has valet, but I strongly recommend against even driving into the lot. It will most likely be full. Sometimes you may end up blocking the traffic on the street. Try finding free street parking in the area instead.</p>
<p>I've been here twice with my best friend and we've been lucky both times with being seated quickly.  This place can get very popular and parking is always crowded -- street parking is your best option. We ordered the chicken noodle soup and medium bossam. The chicken noodle soup is creamy yet thick but so satisfying.  The seasoning is on point.  The bossam is so good! This is a must try. Adding the cabbage, jalapeño, meat, garlic and radish together sends a flavorful mixture to your tastebuds! On a hungry day, we usually finish both items!</p>
<p>I came here for dinner and wanted to try sujebi for the longest time. I was happy that they were able to swap the kalguksu for sujebi instead and I got the clam soup. The broth was so flavorful and the sujebi was delicious. I also loved the pumpkin in the soup. My friend got the spicy seafood kalguksu and he really enjoyed it too. He loved all the seafood inside and he said that the broth was delicious. I definitely want to come back to try their bossam because that looked delicious too. The line is also quite long so be prepared to wait if you come at prime time. They also take your order in line so by the time you get seated, your food will come quickly.</p>
<p>Hands down, my favorite restaurant in Ktown!!! The most hearty, comforting noodle soups ever. My favorite is the chicken kalguksu, which is the most flavorful bowl of chicken soup with hand-pulled noodles and half a cornish hen. I will NEVER get over the noodles here!! The noodles and generous portions - seriously 100/10. I recommend this restaurant to all my friends and family that visit from out of town. Service is also great and super efficient here. Street parking can be a bit of a challenge here, but they have a valet lot with very reasonable prices. A must-visit!</p>
<p>No Fees</p>
<p>Tried the spicy chicken kalguksu. So yummy!! Perfect dish for cold weather. Huge portion.Definitely recommend coming here since we are entering colder seasons.</p>
<p>If your in Korean Town, and feeling "Hungry" Los Angeles, be sure to check out Hangari. It's such a hidden gem! The moment you step inside, the cozy ambiance and the rich aroma of Korean cuisine, surrounded by people in their 20s-50s enjoying the food set the tone for a delicious dinner. The standout dish at Hangari Kalguksu has to be their Bossom. The succulent, perfectly cooked and melt-in-your-mouth pork belly is beautifully complemented by an array of fresh, crisp vegetables, garlic and jalapeños slices, and a medley of flavorful side dishes to go with. Each bite is a harmonious blend of textures and flavors, making it an absolute delight for the palate.The seafood soup is another must-try. This steaming bowl of goodness is full of flavor! Featuring a robust shellfish and crab flavor that's simply intoxicating. The noodles in the broth seems freshly made and has nice satisfying chew to it. The broth is rich and comforting, and it's generously filled with plump, juicy meat of seafood that will have you savoring every spoonful.Hangari Kalguksu in the heart of Korean Town, Los Angeles, is a culinary treasure that deserves a visit. Whether you're a fan of bossam, seafood soup, or simply crave authentic Korean flavors, this establishment is sure to leave you with a deeply satisfying and memorable dining experience.FYI... the parking here isn't that great, I would recommend either Ubering here or pay the valet $5 for them to park your car in the lot. Otherwise, street parking is very limited in the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Ktown staple in Alexandria plaza! There is usually a wait for lunch as it gets packed but came here solo for a quick meal. Ordered a small portion of their chicken kalguksu. Noodles had the perfect texture. Chicken was fresh. Love the addition of pumpkin in the soup, adds a beautiful sweetness to the dish. I'll never stop coming here for noodle soup.  Chicken kalguksu (small): $18.99</p>
<p>I am still dreaming about the bossam from Hangari! I came here for a late dinner with a few friends and everything exceeded expectations. The restaurant has a very cozy yet modern vibe. Even though it was a full house at 9pm, we were seated really quickly. The server was really nice and attentive. He recommended two dishes for our group. We ordered the bossam and the seafood noodles to share. The bossam was soft and tender, and the sides complemented the pork belly really well. I especially liked that the napa was blanched, which made it easy to fold little lettuce wraps. The seafood noodles had a really rich broth, and they did not skimp on the seafood. Both portions were really large and more than enough. My only issue with this place is the parking. The lot is really small so you will likely spend quite some time finding street parking. It's probably best to Uber.I will definitely be back!</p>
<p>Probably one of the worst experiences and expensive experiences thus farRestaurant was empty for a 300 PM weekday lunch The 1 star is for the server who made space for my Grandma's walker  Items either have no taste or overly spicyEverything is overpriced The most famous dish: the steamed pork belly slices was $48 for less than half a pond of pork and some raw vegetables around it for pairing 4 entrees was $154 dollars before tip Will not be writing a full review because it's just not worthy of even that</p>
<p>One of my go to places in ktown. They are super friendly and accommodating to our food preferences/restrictions and always make sure that what we order is correct, and it is! I am pescatarian and they always ask me to make sure if I want to eat certain foods/ let me know what ingredients are in which dish. Everything is super flavorful and delicious and very consistent!</p>
<p>Located in Koreatown Los Angeles. In a small lot and very busy but worth it. When you stand in line, they already have the menu for you ready to order. So that by the time they sit you down, it will speed up the process of getting everything out and served. Quick and friendly service! Minimal and industrial decor and love their "Check out my noods" sign.Known for their hand cut noodle soup. When you come here, definitely bring your friends or family or someone to share this deliciousness with because they serve up big portions! I underestimated what I ordered and made my friends help me.I got the Tokbokgi (rice cake and fish cake boiled in sweet red chili sauce with onion and egg). YOU GOT TO ADD THE MOZZARELLA CHEESE!!!! It is a must! Pairs well together. With the savory and sweet with the different textures from the dish. You get chewy, soft, thick, saucy, stringy.. Just a lot of textures but a flavor blast in itself. And you gotta love the cheese pull! So satisfying!!!!I also got the Seafood Handmade Noodle Kalguksu (anchovy broth with shrimp, crab, mussel, clam, zucchini, kabocha, and potato). You have the choice of spicy or non-spicy. I went with the spicy and it definitely had a kick to it! The broth was savory with a hint of sweet and a richness to it. The noodles were thiiiiiiiccck and slurpilicious. They give you a decent amount of veggies and seafood. The veggies were cooked well. I loooooove kabocha! You get the sweetness from it and a slight pumpkin soft texture to it. It works well in hearty and flavorful soups.Will be back again!!!! Cause I literally can't stop thinking about the noods.</p>
<p>Parking is always the challenge in this area. It's worth the circling or paying the valet if there is space. Fast and efficient service. Sometimes you have to wave down a server. Everything we had was simply authentic, tasty, and on point. Came here originally for the bossam, which is the best in K-town in my opinion but was equally impressed with the kalguksu and the sujebi. Can't wait to try more on their menu.</p>
<p>I've been waiting for an opportunity to try this place since forever but couldn't justify driving/parking/suffering in Ktown traffic. At least no until some friends came back to LA to visit. I ordered their non-spicy chicken kalguksu (닭칼국수 on menu). While my friends ordered the spicy seafood one. I tried some of their seafood kalguksu and it wasn't that spicy. Turns out you can ask for more heat. The chicken kalguksu was better than what I was expecting. The portion size is huge and theres a lot of chicken meat, potatoes, pumpkins, and knife cut noodles. The chicken meat was soft and moist. Soup base was very refreshing and didn't make me thirsty for water afterwards. The real goods was the knife cut noodles. They were the springiest noodles I've ever had. After sitting in t he soup for awhile, the noodles had the broth flavor too, making it even better.Overall, incredibly good food especially after an afternoon drinking session or during colder days. Service was great as we kept asking for more spice and they kept handing more to us. I would come often if traffic and parking in ktown wasn't horrendous.</p>
<p>The last time I was here was in 2019, and I've been thinking about their kalguksu ever since! I really wanted to try the kong guksu (noodles in cold soybean soup) but was too scared to commit so my friend very nicely ordered it instead while I got the plain kalguksu. I was not disappointed by my choice, the noodle texture was so good, and the serving size was also huge. Broth was flavorful, but didn't feel too salty or heavy. The kong guksu was very interesting, kind of reminds me of a soupy version of Taiwanese sesame noodles. It was very refreshing! I also liked their barley + ssamjang banchan, I have never seen that at a Korean restaurant before and it was quite tasty, The servers were also quick and attentive.I definitely would not recommend parking in the lot as it is very small and can get very congested. I usually park on the streets around the restaurant. I came for lunch on a Sunday and found street parking pretty easily nearby.</p>
<p>No Fees</p>
<p>3rd times here and got the beef combo. The quality of the cuts are top notch for the price and the service follows the quality. Out of so many kbbq spots I've tried in ktown, this is my fav!Today i tried pork combo it was amazing</p>
<p>Best Small Instance Soup ever. They offer variety of side dishes and the servers are always attentive and friendly.Will come back again to try their bbq sometime for sure!</p>
<p>Meat was very delicate. Well seasoned and cooked with precision. Service was well. Wayne was very enjoyable to have. Had a really good time here!</p>
<p>Came here for the 5th time this year. So good! Next door to aggassi which imo is not as good as KING CHANG. Shawn took very good care of our party. Definitely, one of me and my friends favorite Korean bbq aside from YANGMANI. Get the large beef with the Seasoned prime boneless short ribs + al la carte #34. Banger banger banger</p>
<p>This place has AMAZING KBBQ. There is a lot of variety on the menu and an abundance of sides you get by default (plus you can get refills on sides if desired). I had the beef combination plate and pork rib. The cook everything for you at this restaurant, which is awesome (but I'd imagine a ton of work for the staff). Everything was absolutely delicious, and I really would recommend getting what we ordered. The service was also top-notch and attentive. I'd recommend making a reservation on a busier night. This seems like a great place for groups and families.</p>
<p>Our server Wayne, was really kind and fun. The food was really great!Recommend getting the large and small intestines combo.</p>
<p>Saturday 5pmParking/Wait: They have a valet-only private lot shared between a few of the restaurants in the area that costs $4. Everywhere in K-Town basically has paid parking at night, so at least it's right next to the restaurant. My party of 3 was seated right away. The place was about halfway full when we came but filled up by the time we left. Food/Drinks: Ordered the King Chang Gganbu Combo. It came with pork belly, beef brisket, and a medium-sized mixed (large and small) intestine combo. We were hungry and ate it all, but the portion is probably good for 4 people. Pork belly was nothing special, but the brisket was quite nice. Thinly sliced with nice marbling. The star of the show is clearly the intestine. Really liked the small intestine, little chew with a nice char. Combo also comes with plenty of sides, a steamed egg, and a (spicy paste or soybean) stew. Only draft beer is Sapporo, but it's perfect when paired with the meat.Ambiance/Service: Service was great. Never really had to handle the meat, since the staff cook it for you. Plenty of tables inside, and smoke was never an issue so the vents were fine. Summary: Great KBBQ spot in K-Town if you are looking for intestine. If you are not looking for intestine, there are better and less expensive options imo in the area. I would not pay these prices (easily over $50 per person) just to get the non-intensine options here.</p>
<p>Seeing a lot of reviews on here from accounts with 1 to 5 reviews which is typically suspicious and fishy. I came here with high hopes as I wanted a great KBBQ dinner with two others on a Wednesday evening. Considering this place has high ratings, does have rice paper (important for me) and has intestines in their menu, my partner and I had decided on this place originally. Upon entering around 5pm, there were only a few other tables dining in at the time. Over the course of our meal, there really weren't many people coming in here. We ordered a combo of meat that filled us all up for the most part, but I have to say, the banchan was limited considering the place and even the AYCE places nearby had a better offering for those side dishes. The cheese bowl was definitely a plus here though. Our meat overall was good, but nothing out of this world, and I have to say the service and overall vibes here were not it. A girl came to our table with meat and essentially threw it on our table. We felt that overall for the food quality, offerings, and price point that this place was very mid. With the amount of KBBQ options in Koreatown, let alone LA, I would easily skip this place and not return again. It wasn't awful or anything, just not that great.</p>
<p>If you're looking for an unforgettable Korean BBQ experience, you've found your spot at King Chang LA in the heart of Koreatown! We devoured the small beef platter for two that was cooked in front of us, enjoyed the flavors of the dukkboki stew, and couldn't resist the temptation of the cheesy, spicy beef back ribs. And don't even get us started on the side burner, which allowed us to cook our steamed egg and stews right at our table. Get ready for epic cheese pulls and a feast that will leave you fully satisfied!I love how clean this place is. I didn't leave the place all greasy like the other kbbq places.I always appreciate it when there's a convenient parking in Korea town. $4 valet parking but I would gladly pay than look for parking.</p>
<p>Delicious authentic food,the restaurant is open late and Wayne our server is the goat!!</p>
<p>No Fees</p>
<p>Came here late on a Thursday night, around 11pm. There was no wait so we were able to be seated fast.Our server Shawn was super nice and friendly and he helped us with our order.We ordered the Couple Combo, half portion of seasoned prime boneless short ribs, and the king Chang Galbi Sauce Chicken wings. Our combo order came with choice of soup or ramen and we got the ramen. They cook the steamed egg to order at the table and after it's done, they cook up the ramen. One of the better steamed eggs I've had and the ramen was so good since it was cold outside!We first started with Prime Thin brisket which was recommended to dip in the lemony ponzu sauce they had. It was delicious. Next up in the combo was the pork belly. Nice thick slices and Shawn was carefully grilling it the entire time! I loved the care and effort. The pork was juicy and fatty. I loved dipping it in this spicy soy sauce that they had, not sure what it's called.Then it was the boneless short rib and OMG it was soooo tender! They switched grills according to the meat and man it was cooked to perfection! Lastly it was the fresh bulgogi. It had slight marinade to it and they also used a different grill for it. It was so tasty and definitely really good with rice. The fat just seeps into the rice and collects all the flavor!As we were enjoying the grilled meats, we also got to the the galbi wings, and wow, probably one of the best Korean fried chickens that I've had! The sauce was so good! Not too sweet and had a nice garlic soy kinda flavor. The coating was super crispy and crunchy, while the chicken was juicy and plump! The banchan was really good too! And paired really well with all the meats. Also the servers are super attentive and help you cook all the meats so you don't have to do anything. Overall everything was really good! And would definitely come back for the quality, taste and the service!</p>
<p>We ordered the small Beef Combo which was more than enough for 2 people. Meat is of good quality. Service - servers were friendly and attentive, and they  grill the meat for you; reservations accepted; wait time to be seated not too long. Ambiance - nice Vibe; clean; good lighting and not too loud. Would definitely come back the next time I visit LA.</p>
<p>If I had to choose between King Chang and Agassi Gopchang, I would choose this place! Practically no wait and the quality of the food was really goodWe did a combo set for intestines and did gopchang and daechang. This combo came with side dishes and a choice of Korean stew. Highly suggest you visit this place if you're in town!</p>
<p>There's no parking lot but food and service was good!! For the intestine combo, it comes with a lot of good side dishes.</p>
<p>Great place with amazing food and ambiance! I've been here multiple times on different occasions with different people and it was never disappointed. It is not AYCE but the portion of the combo is pretty much the same as AYCE. The quality of meat and other sides are top notch. Servers are very quick and efficient, they cook for you here unless you tell them otherwise.</p>
<p>Love King Chang. I'm a regular at the Buena Park location, so you know I'm happy that they're also in Koreatown too. Such a solid and reliable Korean BBQ option, and I love how they also take reservations. We came on a Saturday evening, and though it was lively, it wasn't overly crowded. It is relatively loud inside, so not the most ideal place for conversation, but we were busy stuffing our faces anyways LOL. It was someone's birthday that evening, and they really go all out and it gets super loud while they sing and celebrate. We got the large Beef Combo and it was such a decent amount of food, and the meat quality is fantastic. The cold noodles are also a hit here -- highly recommend as a nice finisher to the meal. Service here is pretty great -- lots of servers roaming around.</p>
<p>Excellent food and service! WAYNE IS THE BEST! Good quality meat and no waiting for a table, despite the restaurant being full with customers!We ate all the delicious food so no pics of food to share!!</p>
<p>This Kbbq place has always been on my list and finally I got a chance to try it out! They have the best boneless short ribs I have ever had and it taste very good! The service are also great! They help us cook the meat! And the i love the chill vibe here make us feel comfortable!</p>
<p>Always got a soft spot for intestine so any kbbq place with intestine is automatically good lol. Got the combo and the spicy cold noodle.Combo itself was nice, consisting with small intestine and large intestine(prepped in 2 ways), you get the best of both worlds. Personally the large intestine is what got me. Thicc, chewy, with hints of sweetness. The small is good too, after first bite, more umami flavor stored from the tiny hole will burst in your mouth. It came with cheese too. I did not expect that, but cheese don't really improve the intestine, maybe the beef hut not the intest.The spicy cold noodle was a star too. Make sure to add vinegar, somehow it balances the spice enhancing the flavor. What would be nice is if they updated the picture in menu to look accordingly. Initially just wanted the large intestine set as it looked quite a lot in the menu, as I ordered it my grill was closed. So am assuming it will be made at the back and portioned out to be not as much as what is shown in the menu</p>
<p>BOMB BOMB BOMB.... I have not had the chance to review but I have visited King Chang LA many times and it never fails. Anytime I'm craving Korean BBQ this is where I go! I love the combo for 2 $89for endless sides and 3 meats: marinated short ribs, short ribs, and BBQ brisket. If you visit on the weekend the wait is about 25-30 mins for 2 but if you have a big group it does take longer. You won't be disappointed, it's great for family and friends. It's loud with k-pop music and videos. The parking is out in the back of the building it's less than $10 from what I can remember. 10/10 recommend.</p>
<p>No Fees</p>
<p>The price is reasonable and food quality is good. I went there at 13:00 on Thursday. No need for waiting.</p>
<p>Good food and nice ambiance! enjoyed the date night with my wife. highly recommended, I need to come back for their brunch.</p>
<p>So here's how it goes. Whether dining in or taking out during the earlier time period, everything is ordered from the bakery display area when you first walk in. Secondly, please buy all things ube and always ALWAYS purchase a slice of the strawberry passionfruit cream pie. The guys behind the counter are pleasant and willing to answer questions. Everything is packed nicely for you.The seating are if you wish to dine there is more like an experience. You are transported to grey skies somewhere in France where the mind can wonder as you sip your coffee. Aged meats hang in a nearby window. The place has old world vibes.Most importantly, every French pastry is done EXQUISITELY. Try everything here at least once!</p>
<p>The freakin audacity to set the default tip to 22% when you don't do jack to earn it. We got to the restaurant, stood in line, ordered the food and went to find a seat. Then got up, picked up our own cutlery, brought our own water, requested 3 times for someone to bring us some plates for the bread we ordered. Got up to get water refills and on top of all that they screwed up 1 of our orders. Was the food good? Ya. But was it good enough to bring us back? Hell to the no. I got the kimchi rice which was flavorful and a bit spicy, right up my alley. My sister got lobster omelette which was also good but not phenomenal for that price. My BIL ordered steak with fries and side order of eggs but they never brought the eggs. Who knows, maybe we were supposed to fetch the eggs from a nearby farm, our bad. And my hubby got the shakshuka, and although it wasn't bad, I think he makes a much better shakshuka. Ambiance was cool, we sat outside and got some vitamin D. It was mostly nice until it got too hot but by that time we started to wrap up anyway.  Anyway  I'm still confused as to why we left 22% tip. The tipping situation is getting out of hand here.</p>
<p>/)/) ( . .) ( づ first of all: 4% service fee + 20% tip for self service at brunch? You order first and then get to choose a table and sit. It's not even real restaurant service. We had the short rib burrito which was a wet burrito btw it didn't say on the menu I believe. Solid but nothing outstanding. The cauliflower nachos were good! The pork sandwich was not really that good. It was kinda dry and the bread was just not matching the meat. The meat was also so little that they gave you. Salad and dressing that comes with it is not really that tasty... All in all I had high expectations of that place maybe that's why I was so bummed. Ambience is cute tho. But idk if it gets full if you want to sit next to bunch of strangers sharing a table.</p>
<p>My friend recommended this little brunch spot and I was so happy to check it out. It's first come, first serve so come early if you want to try one of the many delicious pastries. Just wait in line, order, and find a table. My friend swears by the bread pudding, but the person in front of us ordered the last one. Booo! No problem lots of other stuff to try.For brunch, I wanted to order everything! The table ordered the potato pancake (with smoked salmon), French toast (tastes like creme brûlée), the burger, fries, eggs, and a couple of pastries. I ordered the Vietnamese latte, which is made with condensed milk. Yummmm! This place gets crazy busy so don't be scared by the long line, it's worth it. Since they are so busy, attention to detail can be a little dicey. Forgot our water, smoothie, etc. this happened across the board with different servers. There is valet parking. I circled the streets and found metered parking, which is free on Sunday. Score! Can't wait to go back!</p>
<p>Wonderful experience at Republique that lived up to the hype. We ate dinner and brunch the following day since we liked it so much and wanted to try the pastries.For dinner, they have an upscale feel without feeling too stuffy. We got the baguette with pan drippings, Belgian endives, the Cod, Duck confit, French fries, and the apple date tart. Everything was delicious and well-balanced. Service was great and you can tell they have standards there. Wine list is also very extensive.For brunch, it is a little hectic since you wait in line, order, and then find a seat. However, the price point is lower though still on the higher end, but it is worth it. The pastries alone are worth waiting in line. We got the shakshouka, brioche French toast, and shrimp and grits. The brioche French toast was one of the best brunch items I've eaten. It was thick but still airy and crispy. The rest were pretty good but would probably order something else next time.</p>
<p>I heard about Chef Margie Manzke's legendary work. It's great to check it out finally. Here was my experience.AMBIANCE:Parking: Street parking, mainly metered parking. It gets competitive, so I suggest ride-sharing.Seating: Plenty of seating for about 100 people or so. Great for large groups or small groups.Vibes: Welcome to El Lay! Plenty of gems from things to eat, sightseeing, and other entertainment. The spot itself is a pleasant gem. For some reason, it looked Diagon Alley from Harry Potter from a distance. The spot itself was clean and spacious. I dig the lite rock music playing in the background. It comes off as a quasi-classy place but still family-friendly. Great for a food adventure or date night.FOOD:Ube Latte (Recommend)Delicious and comforting. Ube has a subtle nutty and vanilla flavor with a pleasant purple aesthetic.Koshihikari Rice (Recommend)Another familiar and comforting dish. The shimeji and maitake mushrooms provided savory flavor and protein-esque comfort. The takana gave a nice soy sauce taste. The supergreens and radish gave it a nice refreshing touch. The poached eggs was different and looked lovely. Finally, the avocado had a different feel to things.Bacon Steak (Recommend)I ordered this at the side and it was well worth it. A very thick smokey and savory slice of bacon. It was juicy and just melted. It had a good balance of meat and fat. I added this to my rice and it complemented it very well. Chocolate Chip Cookie (A-Ok)Overall it was good, aesthetically, it looked great, and it was crunchy and chewy. This may have been an outlier, but I felt like the chocolate wasn't well spread throughout the cookie. Ube Crinkle Cookie (Recommend)This delight is trending, especially if you look for Filipino stores or bakeries. It does hold it down - subtly sweet and sizable; its softness stood out from other crinkles.Poptart - Mixedberry & Nutella (Recommend)This was my favorite out of all of them. It was not your usual from the store Poptart, so that was a delight. The mixed berry was sweet and complemented the Nutella well. Pandan Brioche (Recommend)Pandan is a Southeast Asian plant that gives sweet/coconut/vanilla flavors. The pandan was subtle and blended well with the cream inside. The brioche itself was delightfully firm and soft.CUSTOMER SERVICE:Great! It was a super busy day but people were friendly, quick, and professional.TL; DR OVERALL:5 Stars. Lovely! Great selections, reasonable prices, and a pleasant experience. This place lives to expectations and I look forward to coming back to this place. Kudos to Tita Margie Manzke her husband and the rest of the team. If you want some affordable fine dining in Los Angeles, be sure to check this place out! #FilipinoFoodMovementTIPS:* Come early, RSVP if possible, and look into their dinner menu!* https://news.abs-cbn.com/ancx/food-drink/features/06/18/23/pinay-wins-outstanding-pastry-chef-at-james-beard-awards</p>
<p>Arrived around 11:30 am on a Saturday - there is a line out the door for the bakery. If you want to get seated inside without bakery goods, you need to head in and order before being self seated.we ordered four dishes, which was plenty for three people. - Maine lobster omelette: 3/5 - the omelette was cheesy and buttery. There wasn't a lot of lobster for the price you're paying. The greens/salad was not that fresh either, you can see the gray leaves - kimchi fried rice: 3/5 - it was alright, nothing special about it which was disappointing since everyone raves about it - potato pancake with salmon: 4/5 - the potato pancake was a little dry, could use some help there but the salmon and the egg helped and complimented the dish</p>
<p>The line for this place was insane but I totally understand why. The space itself feels like something out of Harry Potter -- there's a long cafeteria style table in the middle of the room that you can share with other parties, or you can choose to sit at individual tables if you're lucky enough to snag one. I honestly did not expect that much from the food, but everything from the flavors to the presentation really surprised me. The sweets were light and had really fresh fruit flavors, and the potato pancake was just so beautiful I didn't want to eat it. Will have to come back to try more items on the menu!</p>
<p>Plenty of street (metered) parking or you can go the easier route and pay for valet parking. This place is popular so make sure to arrive early or prepare yourself to wait in line (which goes by pretty quickly) The atmosphere is cozy and cute! Reminds me of a lot of Hogwarts. The pastries were EXCELLENT! The breakfast I grabbed was the $18 avocado toast and it was good but I'd much rather go back for the pastries vs the breakfast. I tried my bf's potatoes and they lacked flavor. The service was great, I feel like the restaurant needs to change their number placards from cups to something more visible for the employees to find which items go to the appropriate table, just an observation for a logistics standpoint Anyways, overall it was good and worth trying</p>
<p>Republique ´a beautiful michelin starred resto for the thxsgiving foodie postline here is long bc it's so popular but vibes n food made it SO worth, french-inspired bakery, cafe, dining with exquisite interiorif u can snag a res then the tables up in the 2nd floor would b such an amazing experience, near perfect rating 4 republique bc no choice is a bad one here, too hard 2 choose a fav dishorder: matcha rasp bundt cake, honeycake, passionfruit coconut cake roll, ube cookie, pandan muffin, bombolini, strawberry passion fruit cream pie, mushroom toast, smoked salmon& regular breakfast</p>
<p>République presents brunch and dinner crafted with French technique and modern touches. Like me, if you're not a morning person, then a visit here might change your tune. This is the place for an ultimate brunch experience with berry topped waffles, brightly colored tomatoes on toast, pupusas, and croque madame. Soak in the eclectic music alternating between the Fugees and Stevie Nicks, while sitting by a wood fire.Kimchi Fried Rice: The bed of zesty, orange kimchi-flecked fried rice is completely covered by toppings. There are round radish slices, crunchy golden pickled radishes, scallions, and sprouts. Tender morsels of beef short rib melt in your mouth. A large handful of sesame seeds adds crunch to the rice. Break the yolks of the soft poached eggs and stir it all up. Red Fresno chilies add a sweet and fruity taste. Passionfruit lime tart: A lime curd bursting with passionfruit flavor is topped with a coconut cream.Dining area: You've made it to the cathedral of cuisine. Admire the concrete brick walls and high vaulted ceiling. Grab a seat in the long wooden communal table at the center or along the numerous counters.Ordering: Once you enter the doorway, grab a menu from the counter. You'll order your pastries first, and then you'll place any food orders from the cashier. Take the numbered cup to your seat, and the food will be brought to you. Parking: There is valet parking and metered street parking nearby. But, if you message me, I might tell you where to find free 2-hour parking.</p>
<p>This place can have a line going down the block on the weekends. Thankfully, I came here on a random weekday morning while in town and the line was negligible. I had an avocado toast, croissant, and an unsweetened ice tea for breakfast.  The avocado toast was delightful and loaded with vegetables. Additionally, the croissant buttery and flaky. Aside from the food, the ambiance and decor really stuck out to me. The inside gives off modern french ambiance. The seating area in the center also has views of the kitchen and the workers making bread, pastries etc which I thought was a nice touch to the overall experience.</p>
<p>Finally had an actual brunch here. The potato pancake with lox was astoundingly good. We loved the kimchi fried rice as well. As usual, the pastries were perfect, especially the seasonal scone (raspberry chocolate).</p>
<p>I got up at 4am to drive to LA to make the time to make it to Republique, and I can say with confidence that I'd do it over again if given the chance! Despite living in LA for several years, my first time at Republique came after I moved away. Clearly a foolish move on my part. Now that I have tried their food and basked in their gorgeous ambiance, I am already planning a return trip. RIP my wallet and gas bill...My friend and I arrived near opening so we didn't have much of a wait. However, while we were in line hemming and hawing over their gorgeous pastry case, a gigantic line started forming behind us. The brunch gods must have been smiling down on us, as we were able to order and find seats with little fanfare. While we waited for our food, we looked around us and wow, the photos don't do it justice. It feels so well-designed and magical inside, striking a good balance between classy and casual. I loved the soft lighting, natural wood, and giant meat cabinet. Seriously, that thing was HUGE. I almost gave up our nice window seats to be closer to the charcuterie and aging meats. I had to take a moment after my previous paragraph to collect myself before starting my recollection of Republique's food; just the thought of the mushroom toast is making me salivate, and I ate dinner no more than 10 minutes before I sat down to write this. First off, I've heard good things about Republique's bread, and the slice we got in our toast was definitely one of the tastiest European-style breads I have ever eaten. It had a perfect amount of chew with a crisp crust that did not shoot out shrapnel when prodded with a dinner knife. Atop this thick, heavenly slab was an umami MOUNTAIN: perfectly tender ham, sauteed maitake (hen of the woods) mushrooms, scrambled eggs - perhaps just a tad more cooked than I would have liked - and a deceptively simple red wine sauce just bursting with flavor. Each bite was a religious experience, and I was genuinely sad as the food on my plate dwindled. Both my friend and I lingered over the last few forkfulls, reluctant to let this dish end.Now that I've gotten all of the mushroom toast-indued ecstasy out of my system, I can say that their coffee is great and that their pastries definitely live up to the hype. I got the Vietnamese latte which was smooth and didn't have a bitter aftertaste. The latte art was cute and I like the cup that it was served in. My friend and I split a matcha black sesame pound cake and a pistachio and salted caramel croissant confection (looked like a croffin). The pound cake was good and not too sweet, but not very surprising. Now that I know just how good Republique's pastries are, I will not play it safe next time I return. Case in point: the pistachio pastry was not something I'd normally get but it was definitely the star of the show. Salted caramel and pistachio made a gorgeous, indulgent flavor combo, and the flaky crunchy-bottomed pastry was the perfect vehicle for the textural bliss that was custard and nuts. I have historically found myself underwhelmed by croissants that were anything other than croissant-shaped. Perhaps changing the way the dough comes together disrupts the moisture or elasticity or something (can you tell I am not a baker?), but many of the novelty croissants I've had in recent memory (circle croissant, cube croissant, cronut, etc) have been dry on the inside, soft on the outside, and generally disappointing. Not this one! The pastry was flaky on the outside with the soft, buttery inside layers that I love. I was quite full and still savored every bite.Republique has been living rent FREE in my head since I went, and I am quite sure my friends are sick of me ranting about the life-changing toast and pastries. I absolutely cannot wait for my next trip to LA where I hope to get a whole loaf of their wonderful bread as well as a reservation to try as much of their dinner menu as I have the stomach space to fit. From fresh ingredients to impeccable execution, the food here is something I don't mind paying more to eat, as I truly get my money's worth.</p>
<p>Love this place. Has a great ambiance and delicious brunch. A large variety of deliciously baked goods. I loved the shakshuka for something savory, it's rich in flavor. The waffle wasn't anything to write home about but was solid. The Kouign aman had a perfect texture and a delicious pistachio raspberry flavor that paired well. The line can get kind of long here to be careful coming g during typical busy hours.</p>
<p>I ate here on a Wednesday morning before heading to the LAX Airport. It's a beautiful restaurant. I didn't do enough pre-trip research, so I messaged someone I knew in college who currently is a grad student at USC Marshall for recommendations. She recommended this place, saying it was "very popular". I brought my two suitcases with me, and was able to place them next to my table in a non-disruptive way. It is self seating but there is ample seating!This type of menu is definitely up my alley. I liked all the Asian-ingredient touches in an area that has a large percentage of them. Coming from Atlanta, we have *some* options but nothing that's like this. I ordered the black sesame latte, the raspberry matcha bundt cake, and the koshihikari rice. The black sesame latte was decent, but nothing extraordinary. I was most impressed by the bundt cake. The rice may have been a good recommendation from the cashierperson, but I think I would have preferred something like a more traditional brunch item.</p>
<p>Worth the hype for breakfast and pastries!I came with a friend around 8:30am on a Sunday. There was already a line and it took about twenty-ish minutes before we got inside to order and sit down. Considering how bad I've heard this like can get, I think we got off pretty easy. Finding a table was also really easy as we didn't want to sit in the middle of the space and opted for a nice window seat. I got the ricotta toast with seasonal fruits and it was so delectable. My friend got their burrito (I stole a lil bite) and it was also extremely tasty and really rich in flavor. Although not pictures I got the black sesame latte (which I don't think had any caffeine) that I loved. I took some pastries to go for the rest of the week and each one was better than the next! The chocolate croissant was a classic, the little oat cake with fruit I thought would be my fave but the fresh berry and fruit cream filled croissant really took the top spot for me. I'll gladly come back again though will probably order from the little pick up window for pastries and bakery items. That really seems like the move.</p>
<p>Caught them at the perfect time (just after 11 am), with no wait or need to hurry us along.SERVICE (5 stars)Excellent in all respects. Staff were helpful and courteous when ordering, paying, and serving, and checked on us at appropriately-timed intervals.AMBIENCE (5 stars)An understated industrial vibe, with elements of elevated hip, and a touch of glam at the bar. Enjoyed their selection of background music.MEAL  (4.5 stars, overall)* Avocado Toast. Definitely the highlight of our meal, with no skimping on ingredients, stacked high and absolutely delicious. (5 stars)* French Omelet. Surprisingly, a let-down. Ours was on the dry and bland side. Underwhelming. (3 stars)* Bread Plate. Fresh out-of-the-oven deliciousness, served with more than ample amounts of creamy butter and jam. (5 stars)* Café Lattes. Aromatic, rich, frothy, robust yet smooth; the perfect accompaniment to our meal. (5 stars)Perfect spot for brunch and definitely recommend timing one's arrival to beat the lunch crowd, which, as we were leaving, was forming a long line out the door.</p>
<p>I was pretty underwhelmed the first time I came here, but it was so much better the last time I came. Fresh seafood cooked right in front of you, with huge portions if you choose one of their sets.</p>
<p>The best Korean seafood BBQ in Ktown!! Used to come here when it was DaeBuDo, ever since they changed ownership with new brand name. Everything has been escalated to much higher level. The service is definitely top-notch, our server Gun is so professional and courteous, with his experienced skill each kind of seafood tasted great. What really impressed us is that the grill was always neat and that is the key to keep people having good appetite. Highly recommend to try this place, we will be returning for sure.</p>
<p>came here to celebrate my sister's birthday and it was amaaaazinggggwe ordered the captain's set which included sm items i forgot what we got but everything was so dankies. we had a party of 6 and the table was more than big enough to accommodate for us. it seems like a nice spot for date nights and/or group dinnerspresentation was top notch, they brought out Davey Jone's locker with a live lobster which they cooked in the back for usall the seafood items that are cooked on the grill, the servers cooked for us which is awesome cus i feel like cooking seafood is very hard and it's easy to undercook and/or overcook so i was very happyour favorites were the scallops with cheese, clams, abalone, oysters and eelthe steamed egg was BOMBBBB and the knife cut noodles that they served at the end of our meal was seriously so freakin bomb.. especially paired with their kimchi omggg just perfectthe service was really fast & all the workers were very attentive. they took away empty plates, soju and beer bottles right away and always kept our tables stocked with alcohol and wateroverall this is a GREAT spot if u want some super fresh grilled seafood. idk what style of food this is called but it reminds me of seafood restaurants in Busan, Korea.they have a valet parking lot too so no need to find street parkingHIGHLY RECOMMEND TO SEAFOOD LOVERS</p>
<p>This place is actually insane. Such a hidden (?) gem. For a party of 8, we got the chief and captain sets, and we were beyond full afterwards. Service is amazing, they grill everything for you. Price point is not bad for the amount of seafood/sides you get. A great restaurant to hit for a birthday celebration :DThe vibes are so fun. If you get lobster, they bring it out in a treasure chest to let your party see it first before it's demise :/. There's valet parking behind the restaurant.</p>
<p>I've been dying to try this place out and finally got the chance to a few weeks ago! It was a fun dinner date with my one of my close girl friend. She's been here before as well but was still pleasantly surprised by good it was! We got their seafood set and wow it came with everything!! They got shrimp, mussels, clams, LARGE oysters, potatoes, and sweet potatoes. It was honestly so much food but finished most of it! We also got a couple rounds of soju and had a great time chatting and eating. I really enjoyed eating it and would def come back with my friends!</p>
<p>Came here at around 8 PM on a Tuesday night,This place is so good, and they give you a good amount of food. With 4 people, who are pretty big eaters, we got the Master Set and we were pretty full afterwards. We didn't even order extra sides or anything. They cook all the food for you, and kind of guide you into what to eat. My favorite is that they utilize charcoal with the gas so you get a perfect potato and korean sweetpotato that they put underneath the grill.I love seafood of all kinds but I think this style is the best for me. simple, no need for hella sauce and stuff, just the flavor of the seafood shining through. Love the soup and the noodles at the end as well. If you're squeamish, maybe skip this place bc they do cook the shellfish alive and the abalone I had was moving a LOT. Didn't really bother me and it was delicious.</p>
<p>Absolute gem. There's not many Korean style clam "gui," or grill restaurants. My girlfriend came here and really wanted to bring me. I was so glad she did and this place is now in my top 5 places to eat in LA.The interior resembles a ship from the inside- not accurate, but I got the idea. We got the combo that feeds 1-2 people, but man, the side dishes and all made me really full. I normally have to order 2-3 ppl portion. Service is incredible, they check up on you and ensure the food is cooked to perfection.Clams, mussels, shrimps, oysters, etc are all fresh! And if you get lobster, they have a tank they take it out from so you know it's fresh!We saw the hours on google, but upon arrival, we realized it was wrong. I posted a picture with real hours so please look!I'll definitely be going again.</p>
<p>Maybe I was too hyped up for the place but their food (especially their companion side dishes) were subpar. I did like their service and ambience though! Pretty hip and had a outside area for more seating too. Servers were very attentive and professional. We had hagfish and it was good. But everything else was very mediocre in taste, quality, and quantity. They are new though so I totally think they can improve as they go!</p>
<p>This place is so good. The Korean ceviche is jam packed with flavor. John helped cooked our food and he was extremely helpful and nice. Everything we had was full of flavor</p>
<p>Thoroughly impressed by this place!! Super fresh delicious seafood. The side dishes were also on point!! Everything was cooked to perfection and service was amazing! Went on a Friday night at 9 and there was no wait. Parking in the back parking lot (3 dollars). We got the combo for 2 people and it was so much food! The highlight was definitely the thai seafood sauce that goes well with every type of seafood! Noodles at the end were super delicious. And they grilled potatoes underneath the grill. Soooo yummy highly recommend!!!!</p>
<p>Yo, just had the most incredible brunch sesh at Great White, and I gotta spill the tea on their mind-blowing Great White Brekkie. Seriously, it's the ultimate morning magic. Now, parking around these parts can be a bit of a maze, and meters are like ticking time bombs, but once you taste what Great White's serving up, all those little inconveniences just fade away. Oh, and let me drop this gem--their restroom? Immaculate.Picture this: it's a lazy 10 am weekend, and I roll up to Great White. If you're not a parking ninja, it might test your skills. Streets are tight, parking's on a timer, and sidewalks are basically catwalks. But you know what? The flavors at Great White make all those parking shenanigans worth it.So, I go for the Great White Brekkie and indulge in a cheeky bite of the tremendous burger. The Great White Brekkie is like a flavor carnival--sweet roasted tomatoes, a dance of silky eggs, crispy sourdough, and more. Every bite is a taste adventure--salty, sweet, sour, crispy, wet--full-on flavor fiesta!The real champs? A-level service, a rare goat cheese spotting, and an avocado so ripe it's practically singing. Now, the bacon was doing its own thing, a bit too salty for my liking. The tremendous burger, though? Absolute fire.Hit up Great White twice, and they managed to split the bill once, but not the other time. Slightly annoying, but yo, they came through when we brought in a cake. Kept that baby chilled in their kitchen--major points.Larchmont Village, typical Sunday brunch--waited an hour with the squad, but plenty of shops around to kill time. Parking? A puzzle, especially with a farmer's market in the mix. Found a metered spot, and friends hit a flat-fee lot. Patio vibes were tight, a bit cramped but chill. Service was on point, quick cleanup when my friend spilled a drink.Food was mad aesthetic, although nothing had me going "woah." Smoked salmon pizza was tasty, but low-key felt like a lox bagel remix. Breakfast burrito was the real OG--basic but hitting the spot. Chickpea bowl was aight, but something was off with a weird sour vibe. Coffee? Decent, but not gonna lie, other spots in Larchmont got the upper hand.Yeah, Great White might be a bit extra on the price, but for that casual brunch flex, it's got the vibe. The entrees ain't breaking the flavor scale, but the whole scene? Totally worth rolling back for. Counting down the days till I'm back for more morning chill at Great White!</p>
<p>Great place for girls night out or a date! Friendly service, indoor and patio seating. Definitely reservation if possible - they get busy. Got their smoked salmon pizza, ceviche, and rigatoni bolognese. All really tasty, ceviche was a nice touch to freshen up our palates. Pizza was fun - creamy, good smoked salmon, crisp/chewy dough. Rigatoni took the show to though - large rigatoni size filled with delicious sauce. The sauce was not too sour/acidic. Full of flavor. Def recommend.</p>
<p>Restaurant was crowded- there was about a 45 min wait for weekend brunch.Restaurant ambiance was nice- the inside was way cuter than the outside which was super hot in the sun.Service was okay- our waitress would take really long to come check in on us.Food was great! I had the smoked salmon pizza which was very yummy</p>
<p>Leave it to Australians to create an all day cafe that is the definition of casual California cuisine. Great White is a lot of LA Stereotypes rolled into one restaurant; minimalist boho chic interior, natural biodynamic wine list, overly simple/very expensive menu. That being said, they use high quality, thoughtfully sourced ingredients, and are open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We came here for breakfast, and felt that everything was very okay. My Flat White was slightly burnt, but the drip coffee was good. Paying $22 for a single pancake may seem unhinged, but the Ricotta Hotcake was so hearty that you would need to be extremely hungry to finish it. It was super hearty in texture, and I liked the fresh berries on top. My husband's Great White Breakie featured decadent, buttery folded eggs. Apparently this is an Aussie thing, but it reminded me of a French omelette-really really good. The other components of the plate were nothing special though; it was not better than the sum of its parts. Our server was lovely, and the bathrooms were cool (albeit filthy on this particular morning). I doubt we will return.</p>
<p>I tried to stop into their other location in Venice for dinner, but had just missed the cut off for orders, so when my friend who lived in K-Town suggested this location as a middle ground meeting spot between him & Studio City, I was in. We had about a 30 min wait 2:30ish on a Sunday, so we wandered around some of the nearby stores until I got the text that table was ready. Sitting outside was def the move, as it wasn't too hot & the trees provided plenty of shade for my pale friend. Our server was attentive enough (nothing special, but also nothing terrible). Food was fresh & flavorful. I had a salad with perfectly done medium boiled eggs. Friend had a burger cooked perfectly medium. I would go out of my way to eat here, nor would I wait hours, as it's your average California American style restaurant, but if you are near, need a meeting spot with solid food options, Great White is worth considering.</p>
<p>TLDR: Excellent brunch restaurant, HIGHLY RECOMMEND their Great White Brekkie to start any great day of yours. Parking is possible though inconvenient in the nearby residential streets or metered parking, but the tastes served at Great White is well worth the inconvenience. (Also they have a very nice and clean restroom.)- - - - - -A 10am weekend brunch outing at Great White can be aggravating if scouting for parking isn't a natural talent of yours. Nearby streets are narrow, parking is scant and limited to two hours, and the sidewalks are equally as small, but these minor inconveniences are worth the tastes served at Great White.I ordered the Great White Brekkie and sampled a piece of my friend's Salmon Mezze. The Great White boasted a collection of sweet roasted tomatoes, surprisingly salty arugula, silky smooth folded eggs, crisp sourdough bread, and a few other items. Between all the tastes, I really enjoyed the variety of flavors, with bites of salty, sweet, sour, crisp, wet, etc. If my mouth could travel the world of flavors, it really did this morning! The highlights? Excellent service, a rarely eaten goat cheese, and an avocado so perfectly ripe that explaining with words is difficult. I was a little uneasy at the bacon which didn't look like the normal roasted bacon that I was used to. The taste was okay, though a bit too salty and not for me. My friend's salmon mezze was on the saltier side, and I am generally not a fan of smoked salmon... so I'm glad I went with the Great White Brekkie. I initially felt uneasy at the $22 price tag, but after this experience, it was well worth every dollar - and more!</p>
<p>A typical, slightly expensive but aesthetic brunch spot in Larchmont Village. We met with some friends for brunch on Sunday and as expected, it was packed. We waited around an hour for our party of 6 at 11:30 (thankfully there were lots of shops nearby to browse & kill time).Parking was tricky since there was a farmer's market on Sundays too, but we found a metered spot & our friends parked in a lot near the entrance for a flat fee (which we'll probably do next time).  The patio is nice, although it was pretty crammed & not fully covered so it was a bit chaotic with our friend's baby & stroller. Service was decent - my friend spilled her drink and a staff member immediately came over to help us wipe it up.  Food was aesthetic, but overall nothing really wow'ed us:Smoked salmon pizza was yummy, but it was basically the same as a lox bagel with less cream; I think I expected a little more from this entree since it was one of their most popular items. Breakfast Burrito was kind of basic but good; the eggs were fluffy & flavor was balanced. A solid choice.Chickpea Bowl was just okay; something in it tasted extra sour but only in one area of it (maybe too much sauce?) and it was off-putting. I wouldn't get this again. Coffee was alright too, nothing compared to the other coffee shops in Larchmont.It's decent for a casual brunch, although the price point was a little high given the average-ness of the entrees.</p>
<p>Avo toast slaps ok .. this is my other half that I took to go ... ran an errand came back and had it for lefties with the tator tots and the hot sauce ..: omg so good !! Yes yes and all the yess</p>
<p>Food 3.5/5 - breakfast burrito (3/5) was way too mushy, all the flavor should not been mixed but was altogether and tasted like weird breakfast congee. Chicken sandwich was crunchy and flavorful with coleslaw (4/5). But nothing too significant.Our server made our visit seem not welcomed. Don't know her name because she didn't introduce herself but she had a blonde bun updo. Ambiance 5/5 very cafe style but elevated decorations. Don't know if we will come back again.</p>
<p>Service was good.Food was even better!!! I didn't have any expectations for the salad but it was extraordinary. It had so many fun and yummy ingredients that my friend and I got inspired to try making it at home. The salad came with pretty big portions so that was a plus.The truffle pizza was AMAZING. It wasn't too salty, it was perfectly truffle-y--it was just immaculate. I wonder if they'd consider serving the truffle pizza with honey on the side because that would be heavenly. Matcha lattes were pretty good.The ambiance is vibey & chic.TLDR; food is great, ambiance is cool & chic, good service, great place to treat your friends out on a nice brunch.</p>
<p>What is going on everybody?! We are back with another food review. Today I met with some friends in LA for brunch at Great White. I will begin this review with parking. There is paid parking around the restaurant but if you drive down the main road into the neighborhood area there is free parking (2hr max) for certain time/day. When you arrive to the front of the restaurant you are greeted by the host where you will put in your name. Be prepared to wait at least 25-30 mins if going around brunch time on a weekend, it will be busy. Also, I would highly recommend sitting inside as we were put on one of the outside picnic benches where folks will walk past you constantly. There is very limited shaded seating if seated outside which makes it very uncomfortable if it's a hot dry sunny day in LA. The interior was very nice. A lot of neutral colors and bamboo design. We ordered a breakfast sandwich and pancake which both were ok. We also ordered a shaken iced espresso ( easy pass on this) which was alright. I would recommend going to the coffee shops down the street. Overall, great place to catch up with some friends for a bite.</p>
<p>This place is in Larchmont next to a ton of shops (salt and straw, jenis, levain) with street and public parking. The wait was only 20 min for us on a Sunday morning but it got way longer as lunch time approached. It was good food and the ambiance was so cute! Great White Breakfast ($22) - these eggs were beautiful  it was like a deconstructed open face sandwich, my friend said it was perfect proportions and really fresh. The eggs were good esp w the goat cheese! She said she'd go a little lighter w the avo but overall great  Iced Matcha Latte ($7.50) - this wasn't worth, tasted like watered down matcha so I would skip... my friend said latte wasn't v special either so maybe skip on drinks! Breakfast burrito ($16) - this was so yummmyyyy! Outside was crisp w tater tots and fluffy egg inside. I think it had some aioli inside that was superrr delish, a very good breakfast burrito!! Instagram - @joangela.eats</p>
<p>Great White is such a cute breakfast spot with great ambiance. The food was amazing. It was the best breakfast burrito I have ever had. The service was quick and super friendly staff.</p>
<p>Came on a gloomy Sunday brunch time, expecting to wait for a table. Was seated within 15 minutes of checking into the front desk! We got the club sandwich, pizza, and a salad. Club sandwich was yummy, my only complaint is that it came out soggy. The pizza with honey was delish. Salad was also pretty tasty. The ambiance of the place is definitely very cute. It's a good spot for brunch with friends and family.</p>
<p>Fun lively casual but upscale decor- great burgers!!  Good service!  Fun to eat in Larchmont Village- can see and be seen - definitely the "In"crowd dines here!</p>
<p>Came here for brunch with a friend! Upon arrival at 10:30 am on a Saturday, we joined the line and added our names to the waitlist using our phone number. A notification would let us know when our table was ready. The hostess estimated a wait of around 20 minutes for first-come seating, often outdoors. To our delight, her prediction was spot-on, and we found ourselves seated within the promised timeframe. Our waitress was friendly, although it did take a bit of time to receive our water and food.While I'm unsure if this establishment completely lives up to the hype - possibly due to the snug seating arrangement, the beating sun's warmth, and the overall wait - the food was good! Undeniably, the place bustles with activity, and they may benefit from more staff. On the upside, the aesthetic is truly captivating and alluring.An intriguing incentive to dine here lies in a discount they offer - spend a certain amount, and you'll receive a $5 deduction on your subsequent dine-in experience, courtesy of their app.In conclusion, though undoubtedly an appealing locale for exploration, I remain uncertain if the buildup matches the reality. As always, the best verdict comes from personal experience, so I encourage you to give it a try and form your own opinion!</p>
<p>We came for a dinner reservation and even though it's a nice spot to bring friends and such, the food is a bit boring and quality doesn't really match the price. Seating isn't the most comfortable and tables are quite small so that it made it difficult to order more than a few dishes to try.We tried the brussel sprouts appetizer as well as the smoked salmon pizza and both were decent but missing the punch needed to set it apart from other restaurants that have the same dishes. Parking is pretty easy as the area has plenty of shops and metered parking is readily available in front.Service was good, nothing special to note. Not sure if I would visit again.</p>
<p>I love the decor/style of this restaurant, the open architecture and the arches makes it a sort of Mediterranean feel? I can't really describe it but it definitely is cool. The staff also seem to be following this theme of white clothing per the name Great White.All very interesting and cool for Instagram, but as for the food, okay is as far as I'll go. The Brussels sprouts were tasty sure, but most of the time you really can't go with crisped and glazed Brussels sprouts. The squid was okay but felt like the batter was not as crispy as it could be. The salmon pizza was very disappointing, felt like basically eating lox but with a pizza crust instead, and didn't feel like anything was added or improved by making it a pizza.</p>
<p>The food was so good! the salmon curry was probably one of the best ive ever had. The calamari and the very unique salmon and creme freshe pizza was also very good. The service was great and the area was great too. It was my first time in Larchmont and the feel of the place is so nice, i definitely recommend.</p>
<p>This place is always packed! Having a reservation is a must. But note that to make a reservation, you have to put down a credit card and there is a cancellation charge per person. I came for dinner this time. I do plan to come back for breakfast/brunch. I'd say the prices are "LA prices" but I think the portions were very filling for what we ordered. I got the fried chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. The fries were meh and Luke warm. The chicken sandwich was extremely flavorful. The bun, however, could not hold the sandwich. It all fell out and I ultimately finished my sandwich with a fork and knife. My friend had the eggplant parm pizza. It was a good call getting the chili oil on the side because it definitely packed some heat. Our waitress was very nice and the food was served so quickly! There's indoor and outdoor seating, although the restaurant is mostly open air. Parking on Larchmont is always a nightmare so plan accordingly.</p>
<p>:I recently dined at Olivia and she was mind blowing!!  The ambience was enchanting, with cozy seating and beautiful decor. Their commitment to using fresh ingredients from the farmers market every week was evident in the vibrant flavors of each dish. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, making the experience even better.  I AM NOT A VEGAN but definitely had a good time with my fiends and simply appreciated the great food,  its  a must-visit! Hence why I put so much time into review lol</p>
<p>Second time at Olivia and it was just as great as the first. I loved their hearty bolognese pasta and finally tried their pizza too. The crust was chewy and warm. Quality ingredients and great ambiance. Will definitely go back to try their other items.</p>
<p>One of the most delicious vegan/vegetarian places I've ate at in Los Angeles, hands down!!!! I am not a vegetarian or vegan and I enjoyed everything about this restaurant and the food! The service was amazing and fast, the ambiance of the restaurant is kind of sexy yet cozy and quaint! The food just blew me away though. We had the "crispy chicken" as a starter which is just fried oyster mushrooms and yummmm!! Omg they were so good and perfectly crispy! Next we had the Cavatelli pasta which is to die for!! This pasta was so good, we ordered it to go as well! We also had the Anderson pizza that was super flavorful and delicious! Nothing we ordered disappointed us! I will definitely be back for more! Pricing is super fair here, portions are perfect!10/10 recommend</p>
<p>Such a delicious and unique dining experience that vegetarians and non-vegetarians would enjoy! Olivia offers a nice, intimate atmosphere perfect for a date night or dinner with friends. My partner and I dined in on New Year's Day, so our experience of the menu may slightly differ than other days.The staff were so welcoming, attentive, and warm from start to finish, and they offered great suggestions and recommendations throughout. Here's a recap of what we ordered:- Crispy chicken (i.e., oyster mushrooms): we were pleasantly surprised at how light this tasted despite being fried! This would be the perfect appetizer for fellow meat-eaters who are wanting to try something familiar, yet new and vegetarian.- Sunchoke apple soup (part of the NYE menu): probably my absolute favorite soup that I've ever ordered at a restaurant (bring it back!!!). This had a very light, slightly sweet and savory flavor, yet was complex and nothing like I've eaten before!- The mushroom pizza: hearty, cheesy, and perfect for sharing, though I wished for something acidic on top to cut through the savoriness of the cheese and mushroom- Stuffed squash blossoms: these really surprised us! This dish had creaminess, heat, and wonderful texture. I would definitely order this again. - there was one dish that I can't remember the name of - something with an Italian name that was a chef special, lol. It was delicious though! It was similar to a herby gnocchi with a sharp cheese, and the mushroom sauce was very savory and flavored with hearty winter herbs (like thyme, rosemary, and sage). This really made me appreciate earthy flavors in a pasta dish.- Blackberry lemonade and yuzu spritzer, both which were delightfulI would definitely come back! Thanks for a great dining experience!</p>
<p>Olivia is a delicious plane based spot in KTown. Went on a Friday night. No reservations, no problem. Got seated at their communal table. As we were dining, Anderson Paak walked in for dinner. Not a fan of their QR code menu. Hard to read.Vibes: fun, cute, good for date night or groupsWhat we had:Fried Olives - yes!Squash / batter too heavy, over fried - didn't loveFocaccia - yesMelon salad - yesCavatelli - just okOverall, like not love. Good to try once!</p>
<p>Everything was delicious!! We got the ANDERSON PIZZA 10/10CAVATELLI PASTA 10/10 FRIED OLIVES 10/10So so fresh and all the ingredients are not too heavy. Everything was well portioned and I love that they change out their menu items.Staff was also amazing and they have parking in the lot!</p>
<p>Fantastic restaurant for a hearty meal- bonus is you wouldn't even know that it's all vegetarian. Their pizzas and pastas are outstanding- a must try. Pizzas are all unique and flavor-packed, with a perfectly crisp crust that stays crisp throughout your meal. My favorite pizza is the mushroom, but every one I've tried is tasty. We always order extra and take home the leftovers. They reheat nicely! Love the cavatelli pasta too-the ragu sauce somehow tastes meaty. So good! It's a cozy restaurant with around 10 small tables. Perfect for a date or meeting up with a few friends. Hostess and servers and very friendly and welcoming. They even have a shared parking lot with free parking. My only critique is the menu/ordering method. You scan a QR code and enter your phone number to order and pay. On both of my visits, the dishes I wanted were marked as out of stock but actually weren't. Had to ask our server to update the ordering system so that we could order it. Call me old fashioned, but I still enjoy looking at an actual menu and not needing to give out personal information just to order when dining in. Inconvenient, but still worth it for the food.</p>
<p>Cute all-vegetarian restaurant located in Koreatown!My friend recommended this place for us to try, and I am so glad she did! I ordered their Organic Coconut Rice ($22.00) and Blackberry Lemonade ($8.00), and they were delicious! The aesthetic of the place is cute and warm, giving off good, happy vibes. What's unique about this place is that you order entirely via their kiosk code. Only one member of your party needs to attach the order to your credit card, similar to an open tab concept, and shortly after, your food arrives! Therefore, their staff/waitresses don't necessarily take your order, but I assume they do if you don't have a phone or didn't bring it. Throughout the meal, the hostess/waitress checked up on us and refilled our water--it was excellent service! Regarding parking, the restaurant is located in a mini plaza, so the parking lot is free if you can find a spot. I arrived here at 6:15 PM on a Saturday and was still able to find parking. Overall, it was a pleasant experience! I would highly recommend it! :)</p>
<p>So when I first walked in I didn't expect it to be on such a date night tip as it was. It has a really great low key yet upscale date night vibe. Plenty of people were dressed casual so I was fine. The service and staff was great! The Risotto and the Pasta I got was all very flavorful and tasted very fresh. My wife and I were really impressed. Let me explain the 4 stars. I'd love to give 5 but the 2 pizzas I wanted didn't have a Vegan option and I kind of was set on ordering one of the two before I read it couldn't be made Vegan. With that being said I will definitely be back again next time for a casual lunch.</p>
<p>A "storefront paradise"Just dined here tonight and I had to come home and write a review. First off, let me say WOW! I know a lot of restaurants get hyped when a celebrity collab or backing is made known to the public - but this Anderson Paak-partnered culinary feast didn't disappoint. You enter into what seems to be a random shopping mall only to find the gem that is Olivia.Food:Since it was our first time we ordered a few dishes.Butternut Squash & Carrot Coup - this was a chef's special. Sheeeeesh! I'm not normally a soup person but this had Fall all over it. The depth of flavor and very subtle heat created a multitude of emotions while indulging in what seems to be a simple dish.Persimmon and Burrata Salad - really incredible! The persimmon had a potato like texture that kept the dish both refreshing and hearty. The burrata was that "cool breeze" you needed and accompanied the dressing very well. Chickpea Stew - HEARTY and Delicious! Everything you think about a homemade stew is in this dish. Hard to explain further - just order it! Anderson Pizza - such a funky, briny delight! I love the flavor cooked kimchee brings to dishes and this was no exception. The umami of this pizza reminded me of spinach dip. The dough was light but crispy and the pizza in it's entirety didn't feel heavy at all.Horchata Rice Pudding - I'm not a rice pudding fan but I'm horchata fan. Although not a super memorable dish (at least for me) it was still good. Flavors were amazing and the hint of coconut added that tropical freshness. All in all, this meal was so filling but I didn't feel bloated. In fact, I feel great and didn't miss meat at all!The staff is SUPER FRIENDLY and very helpful. Vibe is cozy -- small space in general but its packs a big punch. Plus, the music was FIRE. GO HERE ASAP!</p>
<p>I ABSOLUTELY love this place and will continue to come back more and more because of the great food, amazing staff, and cute rooftop vibes! It's right across the street from Burke Williams where I get my monthly massage so I try to come here each month!  I have come alone, I have treated my mom here for Mother's Day, I have come for girls brunch, I have come just to get drinks, and I have come a few times with my teams at work.  You literally can come for ANY occasion and have such a great time.  I love how they label what keto, plant-based, and anti-inflammatory!  I think by now I have ordered almost everything on their menu and everything has been so delicious!  One of my favorite items is their steak tartar and I highly recommend ordering at least two because you'll always want more! The trio spread is so flavorful and a must-try!  Honestly, you can't go wrong with anything on their menu!  Their drinks are also really bomb and sometimes I go and order a bottle of wine because they have a great selection as well!  My favorite server is Sandra and I always request her when I make my reservation ahead of time online!  She's so sweet and can help out with any needs or questions that you may have and can suggest exactly what you're craving- drink-wise or food-wise! She's always so on point and I love her!  This place is such a vibe- I'll probably see you here because this is where I come the most!</p>
<p>Celebrated my birthday at Mother Tongue and couldn't ask for a better dining experience! I made reservations on their website a few weeks in advance. I called the day before and requested for a specific table. They were accommodating. The restaurant is hard to find as it is in an alley of a hotel. The location was beautiful! I enjoyed the pink theme of Mother Tongue. For appetizers, we ordered the selection of all three spreads ($26) plus extra flatbread ($6) and two orders of lumpiang sariwa ($21). The flatbread was warm and fluffy, pairing well with the flavors of the spread. The lumpiang was very refreshing! They reminded me of spring rolls. For entrees, we ordered the squash agnolotti ($25), falafel ($27), jidori chicken ($39), roasted duck breast ($46), and roasted lamb ($85). The presentation of the food was so pretty and colorful. The roasted lamb was the best! Big portion and well seasoned lamb. We also got the Ken Wright Pinor Nior '21 ($100) and a passionfruit margarita ($14). The wine was one of our favorites recommended by our waitress! We were very impressed with their food and would come back for their brunch menu. The service here was outstanding! Erin was our waitress, and she had the most outgoing and bubbly personality. She was passionate about her job and gave us a rundown of their menu. She made my birthday experience special and was attentive. Other staff were incredibly friendly and helpful as well. Mother Tongue has the best service! They didn't give a complimentary dessert but did cut my cake and package the to go food. It's a cute restaurant for date night or to celebrate a special occasion!</p>
<p>Like another review wrote, the food was great but not mind-blowingly amazing. But we definitely had our favs. I really enjoyed the whipped avocado flatbread. Just wish there was more avocado spread but the flatbread was perfectly chewy and baked (forgot to take a pic of this dish!). We also enjoyed the lumpiang sariwa considering we had 2 Filipinos at the table who were actually impressed with this dish. Would skip the mother tongue salad, we all agreed this was our least favorite dish. It was plain and the strawberry sauce/purée was all we could taste. Grilled oyster mushrooms were tasty as well with the curry & chickpea sauce.Apparently the striped bass is one of the more popular dishes but I thought it wasn't as memorable. I don't quite remember how it tasted like actually. We did enjoy the lamb dish, though. Even tho it's "for 2," since we shared all the appetizers, one order was plenty to share between 6 people. I'm so glad we ordered all the desserts because ofc we have a separate stomach for that. We all couldn't stop talking about how good the panna cotta was. I could have eaten that all by myself and is definitely something I would go back for. Please keep this on the menu forever. I don't remember the name of the dessert on the left in my dessert picture.. it was a cake with raspberry.. foam? The cake was actually really good but the foam was a bit off putting. I think it would have tasted better as a cream or something with jelly-like texture. Ice cream wasn't anything too memorable. It just tasted like.. healthy ice cream? Would order again if I want something light to end the meal. Also forgot the name of the top dessert but it was also good! Cocktails were also good but expensive, but I guess that's the average in LA *crying in TX.Service was impeccable! The hostess were welcoming and made sure we were comfortable with our choice of seating (we originally requested to be seated outside but it got windy AF). I like that they have standing heaters and also heaters overhead, but it was just way too windy to be outside (they also have blankets!). We ended up sitting inside and we enjoyed the ambiance & vibe of the restaurant. I love dining anywhere where I could actually enjoy my conversation with my company. Our server.. I'm SO sorry if I forgot your name or misspell it.. I think her name was Geraldine?? She was so sweet! She went over the menu thoroughly and made recommendations, and the food runners explained the dishes well too.This restaurant is actually on top of a luxury gym but the vibe from the staff didn't feel snotty at all. Would definitely come back to try out more items here.One tiny complaint: valet wasn't that friendly. Also they quoted $11 at first but when leaving they asked for $13 (my fiancé didn't hear the first price but both me and my friend heard it, fiancé paid for valet). There were also plenty of parking spots open across the street so save yourself money and just park there instead!</p>
<p>Food was good, but nothing overly hits-your-face-amazing. The vibe and inside is really cute with a lot of great natural light. It was pretty much empty on a Saturday afternoon- and we were there from 11-2! The location has really awful parking: street (Goodluck), paid lots around the block, or valet.</p>
<p>Great evening of dinner and drinks with the family. First time dining at a Michael Mina establishment and it was a great experience. First off, the entrance is a hidden elevator entrance in an alleyway, super cool! Upon entering you will be greeted by the host and walked into their very chic dining layout. You have the option to be seated indoors or outdoors, we decided to stay inside due to the chilly weather. Service was great from start to finish, but the meals were the highlights of the evening. Huge fan of the fresh menu items that provide a unique taste to each entree. Plan a visit, thank me later.</p>
<p>I had a nice dress and wanted to go to a bougie brunch. Mother Tongue was recommended to me and I was so excited to go!The entrance is a little hidden. It's in the back alley but you'll see the sign on the wall when you get closer. If you get the first reservation of the day, you  might need to ask the gym to unlock the elevator. Ambiance is fantastic. It would be a fantastic place for a girl's brunch. Staff were very sweet from the start. I was dining alone and don't love breakfast so I chose not to go with the prix fixe menu. They also have a nonalcoholic menu but the waiter was super honest and said nothing really tasted good. Instead I asked the bartender to make me something fruity and sweet and he made me a really good passion fruit mocktail. I ended up getting the spread trio and the shitake larb. My favorite spread was the Toasted Walnut Muhammara. The pita served alongside the spread was hot and fluffy. I really enjoyed the larb as well. It was so flavorful and filling. The only thing I regret is not coming with more people so I could try more of the menu. I'm totally coming back!!!!</p>
<p>Instagram made me try this spot & you should too : The Golden Hour here Wednesday thru Sunday is perfectly situated between 4 & 6 : with $10 wine pours and $5 Mother Tongue sliders by chef Michael Mina : props to kind Douglas and welcoming hostess Sophia who gave me the tour and was articulate and fun : I love that this spot has opened and there is room for us locals who frequently attend and celebrate all local happy hours : this area is also about to have a major boom when the cement factory goes and a massive 34 story tower moves in. As well as, the proposed Pink Line subway stop here at La Brea & Sunset : thank you Mother Tongue for taking root here first! I love what you do and absolutely will be back for Brunch!</p>
<p>My friends picked this restaurant to celebrate their birthdays at on a Saturday night. One of the reasons they picked this place was because of the ambiance. The restaurant has a really beautiful dining room; it looks like a room from a Wes Anderson movie. The restaurant entrance is a little hard to find, it's nondescript and around the side of the building. It's also in a hotel. We were able to get a reservation for 5 of us and didn't need to book way ahead of time. The menu here in globally influenced, hence the restaurant's name, Mother Tongue. We ordered a couple of dishes to share as appetizers, the lumpia and the strawberry and fennel salad. For my main dish, I had the mujadara, a Middle Eastern dish of caramelized onions with rice and lentils. This was my first time eating this dish and I enjoyed it a lot. The dish also had crispy onions scattered on top and smatterings of fresh parsley. My friends said their mains were good. We also shared a couple of dishes between us including the mango tapioca pudding and the soft serve matcha pudding. I liked that the desserts were light and not overly sweet. Our waitress this evening was very upbeat and enthusiastic. She was always there when we needed her and gave us great recommendations. I'd recommend trying Mother Tongue if you're looking for a nice restaurant in Hollywood. The space is large and the restaurant wasn't particularly busy.</p>
<p>I came here to celebrate my bestfriends birthday! The restaurant is kind of hard to find because it's in an alleyway. Our Uber got lost twice haha. The place inside was super cute and very chill vibes. Service here was great! Sandra was our server and made sure we were we'll accommodated and checked up on us frequently. We ordered a wide variety of food! All the food was really delicious. I liked the steak and frites, but they only had two pieces :') the 3 spread was good and flavorful and a good add on to the other apps we got!</p>
<p>This restaurant is such a hidden gem. First off, it's difficult to find this place. I think I walked around the block three times. It's tucked within an alleyway and there's an elevator that takes you to the restaurant. It's beautifully decorated in every way. You can tell they really put effort and thought into the design and little touches. Everything from the furniture to the tableware to the glasses, to the lamps on the tables, it's so well executed and stylish. Very photo-worthy. Lots of seating inside and there's an outdoor section as well where you get a decent view of Hollywood.My friend and I each ordered an aperol spritz, a classic.Toasted Walnut Muhummara: This dip was so comforting and delicious. A nice way to start off the meal. A savory dip served with freshly warm pita bread. Best eaten fresh, once the pita gets cold it gets tough.Shittake Mushroom Larb: This is so fun to look at, and so fun to eat. There's a crunchy rice sheet over each lettuce wrap, each one is filled with mushrooms and tofu. Great combination of flavors and textures as there's some lime in it too. This is a must get and it's great for sharing. It gets a little messy, there will be some drippage on your hands, but it's worth it.Seven-Vegetable Cous Cous: A stunning dish. A bowl with the vegetable medley comes along with a side bowl of cous cous. This was good but my least favorite out of what we ordered.Pacifico Striped Bass: This is a dish that will make you say "wow" when you eat it. It's served in a coconut broth and there are scallop pieces included too. The fish was cooked perfectly and the flavors were wonderful.My friend and I ordered some dessert to finish off the meal...Soft Serve Sundae: This is a dairy-free soft serve ice cream with cubes of matcha cake and it's topped with goji berries and bee pollen. Such a nice way to finish the meal!</p>
<p>Super cute and chill spot with great views! I went for happy hour and sat on the rooftop, adjacent to the pool. We got a couple of reasonably priced happy hour items and drinks. It's a really chic experience priced much more casually! The bartenders we super cool. The atmosphere was really laxed. I'd totally go back!</p>
<p>This place is sexy. Stunning interior and delicious food! The lumpiang Sariwa changed my life. So fresh and unexpected. Our server, Adiam, was absolutely lovely and knowledgeable. Will def be returning!</p>
<p>I went for Sunday brunch a couple weeks ago. I initially had a hard time finding the place because you have to enter the restaurant through valet which is accessed in the back alley. The valet attendant was very pleasant and helpful. He directed me to the restaurant from valet. Once I entered the restaurant I was taken away by how freaking cute the inside dining area is. The hostess, Karen,  greeted us at the door and sat us at our table outside. She was a total sweetheart. I ordered avo toast with the grilled jidori chicken. It was good but wished I ordered the wild salmon bowl after tasting some of my friend's. We ordered several drinks and I enjoyed them all. While we were there, two more people met us and joined us to eat and drink. Although our reservations were for three people, Karen was so nice and accommodated us with another table that sat five people. We continued to order appetizers and several more drinks. I had a good experience and will be back.</p>
<p>Such a cute rooftop place to go for happy hour!! The trio dip is amazing esp the muhammara it's like sweet and savory and just so good. The whipped avocado dip is also really delicious, reminded me of the whipped eggplant from elephante but avocado version. The bread is nice and thick and fresh. The chicken tikka skewers were delicious. Nice and flavorful with the perfect amount of masala(spice). The vibe is what makes this place so special. It's such a cute rooftop with views of Hollywood and pink booths. Love it. Only reason why I remove one star is the dinner menu is unnecessarily expensive so I wouldn't stay for dinner but worth to go for happy hour!</p>
<p>What a unique place perched above a high end gym and by We work! The restaurant/bar has indoor and outdoor space to kick back and relax with a drink, appetizer or have dinner! The ambiance is sweet with its pink and green color decor! Nice long bar to curl up to as well! And a big open kitchen that's glassed in!As for food and drinks: we just had happy hour! The happy hour consist of various appetizers for 5 dollars and cocktails and wine for 10 dollars! We elected to try one of their infamous dips. The dip consist of red pepper, nuts and molasses among other things. The dip was very flavorful. The dip was accompanied by fresh pita. Good little appetizer to pair with my cocktails. I started with a mango margarita: super yummy. A little sweet. The vibe tends to be young people during happy hour. Most of them were enjoying the pool on the rooftop deck that's part of the gym not the restaurant. The gym is 300 dollars a month. The mini booths by the bar consist of mostly people working. Worth a place to visit for drinks and views! The rooftop is a perk in itself! Lastly the entrance is tricky. It's not on the Main Street but an alley behind the building. Find the elevator and take it to the fourth floor.</p>
<p>Came here for brunch to celebrate a friend's birthday. Their brunch menu features 2 items for $39. You get a 1st and 2nd course which is a great deal. The servers were friendly and the decor in this place is awesome. It has such a retro yet modern feel and it wasn't too hot for us to enjoy the rooftop terrace. The crudo was delicious, avocado toast was standard, but we all really loved the flat bread with spreads. The spreads were phenomenal. I got the breakfast sandwich which was a solid choice. Crispy pork belly could've been crispier. Overall a great spot to grab brunch, they also do bottomless rosè!</p>
<p>Came here on a Saturday night with a group of friends. It was a little hard finding the place but someone on the street let us know the entrance was around the corner. I thought it would be hard to get a reservation for a prime date/time but got one just a few days prior; it made me a little apprehensive, for a hyped restaurant being surprisingly free usually meant it was mostly style and no substance.The worry dropped as soon as we got seated. The waitstaff was friendly without being overbearing, efficient but courteous. We started off with drinks and I appreciated that they had a few cocktails that were whiskey based that weren't just based on the old standbys. I went with the Strange Magic, a Japanese whiskey based cocktail and which was different and enjoyable.For starters the four of us split their house salad which had a good crunch from the coconut granola and a nice tangy sweetness from the pomegranate vinaigrette. The other starter was the tartare which three of us enjoyed, the fourth is not a fan of tartares so she didn't try it. The pine nuts was a good touch, added a little lightness to it.For mains, I ended up getting the filet which came with potatoes and a chimichurri finished with some greens on top. The dish was right sized, satisfying with the chimichurri adding a nice tang to the steak. I didn't share but I didn't manage to try the Striped Bass where the curry actually had a nice earthy element to it.Overall, our experience there was excellent and was a great night out.</p>
<p>Celebrated my birthday here over the weekend. I had trouble getting reservation confirmation through their website so I tried emailing info@hellomothertongue.comResponse was quick and easy was able to reserve for a specific seat and requested for birthday dessertsOnce we got there we went through the alley way and elevator was not hard to findService was amazing 5/5Food was even better 6/5And the chef even came out to wish us a happy birthdayAll my girlfriends also commented on how great the place was after. Very successful birthday. Will be back.</p>
<p>Great patio, lovely decor. Exceptionally attentive service without being invasive. Good wine list with lots of options in most price categories. We had some of the dips at the recommendation of the server. She was absolutely right, they were delicious! I'm a fan of appetizers to share, while the mains looked really good, there were so many different appetizers to share, you can easily make a meal of that. The famous lettuce cups were as promised, totally refreshing and highly recommended. I'd return.</p>
<p>Excellent food that far surpassed our expectations and we also didn't know it was a rooftop so bonus points! I would have given it 5 stars but unfortunately the service was just extremely slow and they kept forgetting things that we asked for. The most of all was water that for some reason was really hard to come by and we were really unclear why. We will definitely be back and hope that the service is a bit more prompt and proactive next time to match the delicious food and ambiance</p>
<p>The Korean Fine Dining experience at Joseon is a culinary adventure that left my taste buds dancing and my senses overwhelmed with delight. The service at Joseon is impeccable. The staff is attentive and knowledgeable about the menu, and they're more than happy to guide you through your dining choices. From the moment we sat down, we were treated like royalty. Our water glasses were never empty, and dishes arrived at the perfect pace, allowing us to savor each course.The highlight of our evening was, of course, the food. Chef Debbie Lee dedication to authentic Korean flavors and their commitment to using the finest ingredients shone through in every dish. The menu is thoughtfully curated, offering a balance of traditional Korean favorites and innovative creations.</p>
<p>My wife and I had a great dinner at Joseon with friends last weekend. We were greeted at the door immediately by the hostess and we sat in the dining room, a very clean/modern feel. Everyone at the table tried one of their house special cocktails, the one I had with bourbon was really nice and unlike anything I've had before. The rest of the cocktails and the bar looked intriguing, but that's for another night when I'm not driving home. We started off with a bone marrow appetizer that was fantastic. It was very rich and was topped with a chimichurri like sauce and served with deliciously buttery crackers. We both enjoyed the 7-course menu and we ordered different items for most courses so we were both able to share and try more of the dishes. We're both familiar with Korean food, but nothing like the elevated dishes we had here. The waiter described all of the menu options clearly and he was very patient with our questions. We enjoyed everything and we each had our own favorites. My wife's favorites were the royal dumplings and the wagyu oxtail. I tried both of those too and thought they were both delicious, but my favorites were the black cod, and the prawns. We both got the rice cake soup as the last course and it was a nice finish to the meal. Overall we really enjoyed the ambiance, the food, and drink. Parking is limited, but there's valet parking right outside the door which is very convenient. Highly recommended!</p>
<p>Really great experience for my belated birthday :) Make a reservation on Resy. They have valet parking for $12 but if you circle the neighborhood, you can get free street parking. Just read the signs to make sure you can park there Inside is super clean and modern. The lighting is dim with some hip hop music. Service is fantastic. We picked the 7 course meal with one set of alcohol pairing. The plating and presentation is beautiful. There were some dishes I liked more than others but it was an experience to enjoy them all. I think my favorites were the crudo, cod, and dessert. The 7 course meal took about 2 hours. Food came out at a good speed. Also, they were very generous with the alcohol pairings. The 7 course meal came with 6 drinks and they were not sample size either. If you're a couple, I highly recommend to get one drink pairing and share it :) So glad I got to try this :)</p>
<p>solid fine dining Korean restaurant. Glad they're opening more of these in LA (although sad that Kinn is closing as well). It's bold and adventurous - likely will be a challenge to please the tough Silverlake and LA crowd but the bar is cool and the interior is amazing so I wish them success.Food overall was pretty good. My favorite was the squash blossom.</p>
<p>Really good and had some really unique items on their 7 course menu. The beverage pairings were all delicious as well.Fav was the tartare, squash blossom with tofu inside, the cod and oxtail gori jjim with the crispy rice was delicious, and the dessert was also a great end to menu. All the other courses were good but felt like it needed a somethin' somethin' more to be a banger. I wish the presentation of each course wasn't all the same, it felt pretty redundant having so many items look the same. Parking is on the streets.</p>
<p>Joseon was the best meal I had in LA by far!! If you are visiting or a local, you should make time to visit Joseon. Whimsical, stunning, and delicious dishes by an incredibly talented chef in a beautiful restaurant. The meal was well priced for what you get - $80 for a pri fixe 5 course meal in LA. What more can you ask for? I'm so glad I was able to try Joseon while Visitng LA. We went for the 5 course tasting which was filling though we plan to try the 7 course menu next time. $40 for the drink pairing was a great deal and the plum wine and cocktails were delicious. Extra points for the incredible service and beautiful decor.</p>
<p>Best Korean Food w/ Modern Twist by TV personality Debbie Lee (Morimoto's Sushi Master)! The presentation is beautiful with personal touch and tribute to Chef Debbie's Northern Korean roots. They use fine ingredients. The taste was amazing taste with a pop of crispy accent texture in some dishes. I love Debbie's rendition of Korean seafood. It was a night full of culinary surprise for the taste buds. Chef Debbie keeps striving for perfection in her culinary creativity. Joseon is my new Korean comfort food. 5-course menu $79. 7-course menu $99. It's a good deal. The add-ons were delicious. I highly recommend the 7-course menu and add-ons. Come with more people so you can try everything. Reservations are made via Resy. Valet $12 or very limited street parking (read signs). I am excited for their extension. Can't wait to come back again!</p>
<p>In the gastronomic panorama of Los Angeles, where upscale Korean culinary representation has been surprisingly muted considering its substantial Korean populace, Chef Debbie Lee's "Joseon" emerges as a beacon of modern Korean fine dining, a tour de force in an arena where LA has, until now, played second fiddle to the culinary juggernaut of New York City."Joseon" is a contemporary ode to the regal fare of Korea's Joseon Dynasty, an era when culinary artistry was as revered as the royal bloodline itself. Chef Debbie, in a stroke of brilliance, orchestrates an experience that intertwines history with haute cuisine. The menu, a tantalizing array of 5 and 7 course tasting odysseys, many with alternate "A and B" routes, promises a bespoke journey for every palate.Among the culinary pageant, one finds dishes like the Bossam, a masterclass in flavor, the Shila Oysters Rockefeller, and a Bone Marrow dish that could easily be crowned the monarch of the meal. My personal sojourn through the 7-course menu was nothing short of a royal procession: from the humble beginnings of Juk (Porridge) to the crescendo of Wagyu Oxtail stew, each dish was a narrative in itself. The Beef Tartare, accompanied by a seaweed cracker, was a symphony of umami that set the taste buds alight with anticipation.And just when one thinks the crescendo has peaked, the Deconstructed Asian Napoleon dessert arrives, not so much a dish as an explosive finale in this culinary opera.Yet, the experience at "Joseon" transcends mere food. The optional drink pairings are an educational voyage in themselves, dismantling the stereotype that Korean cuisine is best accompanied solely by beer or Soju. From cocktails to wine, plum liquor, and makgeolli, each beverage is a chapter that complements the unfolding story of the meal."Joseon" is not merely a destination for aficionados of Korean cuisine; it is a revelation for the uninitiated, an elegant introduction to the complexities and delights of Korean fare. And with the promise of a new bar menu, including a burger that dares to challenge the gastronomic elite, and a possible vegan ensemble in the wings, "Joseon" is poised to continue its culinary conquest.As a connoisseur of K-dramas and now of Chef Debbie's culinary realm, I may never don the robes of a Joseon prince, but dining at "Joseon" is a royal decree I shall gladly obey.</p>
<p>Our time at Joseon was nothing short of amazing, offering a delightful journey into modern Korean fine dining. The service was outstanding, creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere that added to the overall experience. We opted for the 7-course meal and decided to try the bone marrow add-on, a decision we didn't regret.Out of the array of dishes, four truly stole the spotlight: the Wagyu Beef Tartar, the Wagyu Oxtail, the Black Cod, and the bone marrow. They were all extraordinary! Each dish brought its own unique and delicious flavor that made our overall experience truly memorable. The opportunity to savor these exceptional dishes at Joseon was a treat, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic culinary adventure in modern Korean cuisine.</p>
<p>With so many KBBQ spots in KTown, its kinda nice to see something new and exciting come into view. Say hello to Joseon - a modern interpretation of Royal Court Dining from Korea's Joseon Dynasty (circa 1392). Chef Debbie Lee has put together an incredible five and seven course tasting menu that everyone should experience. From the Wagyu Beef Tartar with Seaweed Crackers to the Wang Mandu with Ginger Pork Rillette to the Wagyu Beef Tongue and the Braised Oxtail Stew. Its all extraordinary. Coupled with the fantastic drink pairings, what you end up with is one of the most special and unique dining experiences in Los Angeles. I cant wait to come back again.</p>
<p>I have tried many Korean dishes and Joseon has given me a very different experience from the soft but beautiful ambience of the restaurant to the unbelievably delicious food! Service is attentive to the point that my glass of water was never empty! The location is at the heart of LA! The style, the taste, the color, the fragrance and to presentation of each dish gives me the best experience!! You gotta try it yourself!</p>
<p>Fabulous ambience, excellent food  and great service  would highly recommend this restaurant</p>
<p>loved the vibe and the customer service :) tasted really good and loved the options too</p>
<p>5/5 stars because of top tier service, food, and ambiance. 1) service: very attentive waiters and answered all of our questions 2) food: super fresh, flavorful, and high quality 3) ambiance: not too busy around 5-6pm and very warm and cozy vibes :)</p>
<p>I have 0 complaints!! The staff is incredible, charming, and professional. The food is heavenly. My table agreed it was the best octopus dish we ever had. The capers and the sauce complemented the tentacle beautifully. The funghi pinsa came highly recommended and it lived up to its expectations. The flavor was powerful and the dough was so unique. I couldn't appreciate the recipe more!!The frutti de mar blew me away. I am a big fan of squid ink pasta and this was so well done. I loved the sauce, I loved the mussels, and I loved the shrimp!! A packed dish that was worthwhile. My kudos to the chef and amazing staff here at Oste. I can't wait to show more friends this establishment and try more dishes.</p>
<p>LOVE THIS PLACE!!! If you are looking for amazing authentic Italian food, go to Oste. Their pastas are amazing and the mussels are to die for! We also ordered the burrata and the octopus and they were all delicious! Casual yet elegantly styled with a fantastic atmosphere, this place strikes the perfect balance. The vibe is both relaxed and sophisticated, making it a great choice for various occasions.The service here is beyond amazing. The two owners were checking up on us throughout the entire meal and making sure me and my friends were enjoying the dinner. Very impressive!! And the servers are friendly and very professional. All of them truly made our dining experience enjoyable and memorable. Must try- BurrataSofia (mussels)Octopus Frutti di mareCacio e pepePanna cotta</p>
<p>Loved the service. Food was well prepared and presented. The only complaint was the too salty risotto. Told the server and they took it away. Blamed it on the cheese ! Deserts were delicious. A little loud at times but it's aneughbirhood bistro. Would definately try again.</p>
<p>Authentic amazing Italian food that won't break the bank.Service 10/10: we came on a Sunday evening with no reservations and were seated within 10min. They have indoor and outdoor seating. They have heaters outside and it's actually quite nice. Romantic ambiance, great for date nights. Menu offers a variety of dishes, from pasta to mains, to mussels and a burrata bar. But the pizza is the item to try. They dough is crunchy and made in house. The pepperoni is a must try and if you love prosciutto, then that's a winner as well. Food comes out very fast and they prefer to bring items out as they are ready, but you can request otherwise. The best part is the prices are reasonable for the quality you get.  I will be back to try others items from the menu and keep everyone updated!</p>
<p>Oste offers delicious Italian food paired with friendly and welcoming service. My boyfriend and I arrived later than our party, and the boss greeted us at the entrance and led us to our group right away. Our server was also so friendly and charming. The interior is modern, open, and inviting. Perfect for a group of friends or a date. Onto the food, I tried the radicchio salad and pappardelle alla vaccinara. The salad was perfectly seasoned and dressed. The greens tasted fresh and crisp. The pappardelle noodles were cooked Al dente and homemade. The sauce tasted very comforting, and the oxtail was very tender. My only critique is that the sauce had a bit more flavor and pizzazz. However, the tiramisu was to die for. Absolutely indulgent and delicious. Overall, we really enjoyed our meals and would come back.</p>
<p>seriously one of the best italian restaurants out in LA! The owner is also always there as well and checking up on tables and chatting it up with all of the customers! ordered our usual, along with a side of burrata which tasted amazing! The owner said they also get it shipped straight from italy! As always, Oste has the best service and food!- Margherita pizza with sausage - side of burrata - cacio e pepe - pappardelle alla vaccinara - fries & aioli</p>
<p>Service was so on point through the whole meal.  I watched the bartender prep our drinks within seconds of our order, I don't know if he was telepathic or what.  It was impressive.  Bone marrow was top notch, risotto was a little too salty but maybe because we ate it right after the bone marrow.  Ragu and oxtails, 10/10!  And to finish it off, the affogato shown above which was probably the best I've ever had.  Excellent restaurant</p>
<p>No Fees</p>
<p>Amazing service who frequently checked in with us and had great recs.The mussels were so fresh and tasty in the rich broth which we then used to dip our pizza bread crust in per the servers rec! Pizza itself was huge and doughy with the perfect crunch to it. Cacio e Pepe was flavorful and would not recommend the caramel something., too sweet. Easy free parking in the neighborhoods .All in all, highly rec for a dinner spot with friends or your s.o! Also right by the grove too so you can do some shopping after!</p>
<p>I love trying new things so I was excited to try Oste's specialty - a Roman-style pizza called the pinsa. We came on a Monday night and it wasn't too crowded. We were able to choose outdoor seating on their beautiful patio. All the staff here were friendly and attentive. They gave us suggestions and helped us narrow down on our orders. Here's what we got (ranked from favorite to least favorite):Funghi Pinsa ($25)When in Oste, you must try one of their pinsa! It's a healthier alternative to the traditional pizza without sacrificing the taste - the crust delivers on the crunch with a light and airy inside. Usually I'd get meat toppings, but the combination of wild mushrooms, cheese, garlic, and truffle oil was so flavorful and heavenly!Truffle Fries with Truffle Aioli ($11)If you love truffles, you'd love these fries. The fries were crispy and tossed in truffle oil. Then, there's truffle aioli on the side in case you want a double dose of truffle flavor. The truffle aioli was so good, I'd dip everything in there. This came with a huge portion of fries so it's perfect for sharing - even when you may not want to!Claudia Mussels ($25)I love mussels so I was excited to see that they have 4 different broths to choose from. The Claudia is a white wine based broth with shallots, bacon, garlic, and parsley. This broth went really well with the mussels - it was savory and garlicky. My only wish was that it came with bread to dip in. And although there was a generous portion of mussels, they were small and not as plump.Homemade Bread & EVOO ($3)This bread is made from the same dough used to make pinsa. These were cut into thin strips and were super crispy. They were nice for dipping in the mussels broth, but I didn't enjoy eating it on its own since I prefer the soft parts of bread.Overall, this is a solid spot if you want some guilt-free Roman-style pizzas! I can't wait to go back to try other pinsas!</p>
<p>Everything was pretty solid. We got three mains and one side shared between 3 people. Just enough to get full without having leftovers (except the complimentary bread) The vibes are really intimate but casual as well. It's not too loud so we can have conversation. The servers were super nice too and spoke little bits of Italian which added to the experience :) I would definitely come again to try something else. Loving the people here as well! This whole street is also really cute so you could walk around after as you digest. There's a good gelato place right nearby as well. Valet $12.</p>
<p>Excellent food. Parking is tough so Valet $$ get the bucks. The mushroom pizza is the best I have ever had and almost everything is excellent. This place is not in my area but it's definitely worth the drive since it's always a great experience. The wait staff and usually very attentive.</p>
<p>Was craving pasta and heard great things about this place so we decided to give it a try! We were able to easily make reservations the day before online. The day of, we were able to get seated right away. We came for a late dinner so the were plenty of seats, honestly was surprised there wasnt more people. We decided to get their bread, beef tartare, sofia mussels and the oxtail ragu pasta. And everything was SOOOO GOOD. The bread went amazing with the mussels. The pasta was super rich and flavorful. The tartare was super fresh and flavorful as well.The customer service was amazing. They checked on us frequently and even swapped out our plates for new ones once. They also waited to bring out our pasta when we were ready since our table was full. They helped time it and had the kitchen start it later so it would be fresh and hot when we were ready for it.So good, would definitely recommend and come back in the future!!</p>
<p>For the number of times I've driven past this restaurant and not noticed it, I'll never drive by it again without thinking of the delicious dinner we had. With four of us in our party, we were eager to try different things and share as much as we could. The wait staff was extremely attentive and helpful as we debated and negotiated which dishes to get. In the end, we ended up with:- Homemade Bread & Evoo- Polpo al Cavolfiore- Suppli al Tartufo- Fiori do Zucca- Insalata do Radicchio e Fi- Burrata al Pesto- Margherita Pinsa- Patate Pinsa- Oste Tiramisu- Chocolate TartDespite some skepticism about the potato pinsa from one person in our party, that was one of the best things we ate. Although truly every savory dish we had was incredible. The chocolate tart was nothing to write home about. One challenge with the menu: not many main dishes that were suitable for vegetarians. Unsurprising when it comes to Italian food, but important to be aware of if you're trying to accommodate various dietary needs!We sat outside which was a nice, serene spot even though it's right on 3rd Street. It was a bit challenging when passersby would be smoking, and there was one person waiting for their table who was smoking and the cigarette smoke continued to waft for 5ish minutes. Obviously nothing to do for the restaurant, but just something to remember when you're sitting outside along a busy street. I'll absolutely recommend this spot to others and can't wait to come back to try more menu items!</p>
<p>I chose to have my birthday dinner at the long-awaited restaurant that I've always heard so much about.The vibe at the outdoor seating area for Oste was everything. I've never been to Italy but I felt like it transported me there with the beautiful plants along the wall and the gold embellishments of the tables and windows.For the food, we tried one appetizer and two entrees. The Fiori Di Zucca, aka squash blossoms, was one of the most popular items that people recommended on social media. I had never tried it before but I was pleasantly surprised. It's stuffed with ricotta and parmigiano and paired with salsa marinara which has a sweet taste to balance out the savoriness of the cheese. It's slightly crispy but creamy so it has a good balance of textures.I had such a hard time picking which pizza I wanted but I ended up with the Patate Pinsa: pizza with roasted potatoes, raclette, garlic oil, parmigiano, and rosemary. Since it wasn't your typical mozzarella, the cheese was rich and creamy which paired nicely with the thinly sliced potatoes. I also loved the touch of rosemary but some bites were much saltier than the others which threw me off. I was excited to try the Cacio e Pepe but I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. It was my first time ever trying this pasta too so I have nothing to compare it to but it was way too peppery. I could only eat one bite and then I had to move to something else to cleanse my palette. Although the food wasn't what I had thought it'd be, the service was amazing. Multiple waiters helped us out but they all had such an uplifting attitude and came by often to replenish our water. We made reservations and arrived later than expected due to the difficult parking situation but they were accommodating and still let us in.</p>
<p>I think that this is probably one of the best pizzas that I have had in LA. As much as I don't want to give the pizza crown to the east coast, they do it really well over there. However, Oste's pinsas put up a good fight! There's a blurry distinction between pizzas and pinsas that only really gets cleared up with a Google search -- pinsas have different flours in the dough as opposed to traditional whole wheat flour, meaning it has more protein and less gluten for those interested in a healthier option. You can't really taste the difference though and the only way I can tell, at least, is by the shape. Pinsas are ovally shaped rather than having a circle or square shape. These were absolutely fantastic tasting, my margherita pinsa was crispy, easy to bite into and real juicy with the tomato sauce lathered generously on top of the dough. I would have preferred maybe an extra basil leaf or two, but it was absolutely delicious. The funghi pinsa was also quite good, but it's generally not my favorite as mushroom pizzas are typically a little bit too dry and difficult to eat for me. It also stated on the menu that it had wild mushrooms on it, but it literally just looked like regular button mushrooms LMAO. The service was great and the ambiance was beautiful inside and outside, and had it not been for the hot weather, I would have loved to sit outside and enjoy the verdant outdoor seating. I'll definitely be adding Oste to the list of great pizzas in the LA area, highly recommend!</p>
<p>Yuuuuuum!  I was craving pizza and this hit the spot!The dough was crispy with a chew, the flavor profile balanced between the cheese, mushrooms and truffle oil which was  prominent without being overpowering.A couple of small gripes: - wasn't sliced.  This crusty dough did not lend itself to being torn. Not sure how they expected people to eat it. - on the pricier side ($27 pre-tax for what's equivalent to a medium sized pizza)- I ordered takeout with a future pickup time, but it was ready about 30 minutes early...meaning it w as sitting there, cooling for 30min before I could pickup.  ‍Taste 5/5Service/price 3/5 Definitely bookmarked for returning for special occasions.</p>
<p>We didnt make a reservation but was immediately greeted and sat down by the bar on a busy Saturday.  Everything we ordered was amazing but my favorite was the cacio e pepe which has a fresh lemon taste on top that brings out the flavor even more and just takes this dish to another level imo. The host and the bartender were very attentive and checked on us many times which we appreciate. Definitely come back to try other dishes on the menu and coffee from that custom made espresso machine.</p>
<p>No Fees</p>
<p>I came here for brunch to celebrate my friend's birthday. It was so easy to make a reservation and parking was a breeze. You can self park for 3 hours with validation for free. When we got there we sat down right away. We wanted outside but the big umbrellas didn't cover all the sun so it was a little hot. Everything tasted great! The drink was one of the best spritzers I have had and the devil eggs were full of flavor. I got the shrimp and grits and the shrimp were huge! For dessert we shared a pop tart and the filling was the best part! It was a blueberry jam and delicious. The service wasn't amazing and it was nice to catch up with friends but after two hours we had to hunt the waiter down to ask for the check. I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu!</p>
<p>I've been holding off on this review because I'm not exactly sure how I felt about this place. ***potential***Ok, so let me start off with the location and parking. The restaurant is located at a hotel. There's self-parking or you can get valet. The first three hours are free and there's a lot of parking spaces.I met my friend for Sunday brunch. It was a last minute plan so I did not make reservations. The place was packed but they were still able to accommodate us at a high top table near the bar.The food is what has me unsure of my feelings about this place. I ordered a chicken sandwich and my friend ordered shrimp & grits. My sandwich was just ok. The bun was hard and dry and it was not really flavorful. My friend said her food was just blah too and the portion was small. This place has so much potential. The food looks like it's going to be good and was a disappointment.We ordered cocktails from the menu. They were tasty but were lacking alcohol. Our waiter recommended a cocktail for my friend. She didn't like it and sent it back.We ordered dessert. The waiter forgot to place the order so we never received it.Again, I feel like this place has so much potential to be better than my experience. I'm willing to give it another shot if someone were to invite me. It's not lacking business so if I never make it back, it'll be ok.</p>
<p>I love the ambience of the front yard. The food is good and the patio is great. I've been to the front yard for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  I think I prefer dinner, but all have been good.</p>
<p>Food is always delicious here. The only thing that wasn't good this time is the fries. They were cold and kind of tasted stale. Everything else was yummy. Service was great. Bathrooms were clean. It is valet parking or you can park in the parking lot and they will validate for you. I look forward to returning in the future. *Make sure to try the brussels sprouts and Mac and cheese.</p>
<p>The ambiance is the absolute best part. The host and person who seated us wasn't too friendly. It always amazes me how someone in customer service gets away with the lack of. The food was good. The parking was free with validation. If you're looking for a cute restaurant to take photos this would be a good pick.</p>
<p>The Front Yard is a beautiful aesthetic restaurant adjacent to the Garland Hotel in North Hollywood, minutes away from the Brady Bunch House and Universal Studios. The restaurant offers free parking for the first three hours with validation. There's even a free trolley that takes you from the Hotel to Universal Studios/Citywalk!I came to the Front Yard a couple of times already, and the service is good. Reservations are recommended. The food is good, albeit a bit pricey. I've celebrated the bestie's birthday here, and we ordered the green garbanzo hummus, pepperoni and sausage flatbread, and tagliatelle bolognese. We also ordered the Nutella cake for dessert, which was sweet and delicious. Overall, super cute aesthetic if you're looking to treat yourself.</p>
<p>Came here with my best friend on a Sunday brunch.Self parking was available and they validate which was nice!We waited ten minutes for our table and then got seated at a patio  booth which was nice. Il the views were pretty and our server was really nice. We ordered:- deviled eggs- fried chicken - Shrimp and grits- beignets - bottomless mimosas! (Yum)Surprisingly, all the food tasted delicious. We will definitely be back</p>
<p>We had a family breakfast here after an event in Burbank. What a beautiful and fun spot and some excellent food and coffee too!  We were a group of 7 and our dietary requests and tweaks were met with flexibility and helpful suggestions. Servers get 5 stars . Food was perfect and delivered to our table in a timely manner and in unison even though the restaurant was a bustling Saturday Morning Crowd. Loved eating outside! But the indoor decor was intriguing and artistic. Bathrooms were clean & well-stocked. Coffee was delicious. And there are selections for those who don't eat meat or dairy.</p>
<p>Came here for Saturday brunch and sat in the outdoor patio. If the weather is nice, I recommend sitting outside. The outdoor ambiance is definitely a plus.As for the food, I ordered the Breakfast Royale with Cheese and a side of adobo fries. My cousins ordered Smoked Salmon Flatbread and the Socal Chicken Sandwich. Overall, we were all content with our food. For dessert, we ordered the beignets and pop tarts. I was stuffed, but I couldn't say no to warm beignets.The service was on point. Alesha was prompt with providing us with extra condiments and more coffee or water. She was also very pleasant.</p>
<p>Mosquito problem. Entire family was bit up. Food was good - hard to enjoy with the suckers eating up our family.</p>
<p>Very good! Beautiful ambiance; the outdoor patio is very beautiful and comfortable, and the interior is very inviting and well appointed. The service was prompt and friendly. The food was decent. The huevos rancheros were mid-tier at best, but I wouldn't characterize this place as somewhere to go if you're HUNGRY, more of a social spot.</p>
<p>I was searching for a decent brunch spot to celebrate some fun times with family last Saturday . The front yard looked very appealing. Made reservations through open table. I was informed 2 more family members wanted to join the fun! So a party of 6 would turn into 8. I attempted to call to modify my reservations however the hostess informed me the "larger tables" were already reserved, however they could "make it work" once we arrive Saturday.Saturday arrives. Pro: the restaurant shares parking lot with the Garland hotel , it's free up to 3hrs, however the restaurant validates and it's completely free We get to our booth and it doesn't seem as if 2 additional people would actually fit . I attempted to tell the hostess I called in the day prior and was informed that they would help us make the table situation work. However, I was met with a hostess that could not be bothered  to help .We did get the pleasure of working with another hostess who was a lot nicer . We decided to make it work. I would highly suggest for a larger party to get the pitchers  if your going to drink. We got the TFY mimosas pitcher . Sooo good  and strong Our server was super nice and the food came out pretty quick. I ended up with the breakfast royale and it was pretty good. As we were slowly coming to the end of our brunch festivities, a man walks up to us and says he is the owner and graciously pulls over chairs so we wouldn't be so tightly squeezed in the booth. But at this point we were comfortable enough. However it was a nice gesture considering we were told it would be a "hazard" to place 1 chair near our booth ‍Overall, we had a good time. Would definitely try again!</p>
<p>My friends and I had brunch here. We were having such a fun time that I didn't think about taking pictures. The food is so good! I especially loved their beignets and their mimosas. We were a large party of 10 girls, so we had made reservations ahead of time. The restaurant is so pretty both from inside and outside. There's a beautiful patio where you can enjoy your food. We sat inside but next time I'll sit outside. The service was fantastic! Our waitress was very attentive, friendly and helpful. I can't recommend this place enough.</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of this place. Been here a few times to meet friends or for business. Bar is friendly. Foood is chill. Nice patio. Overall great vibe. It's attached to a hotel. You can get full validation so keep your ticket and don't forget to ask in the end!</p>
<p>10/5 experience! The front yard boasts a charming outside area and indoor space as well but on a nice summer evening we just had to sit outside and enjoy. There are string lights,  lit up trees, and cute decor. The restaurant sits on the same property as the garland hotel so it can get pretty busy. Reservations are recommended. We started off with some drinks- the Cranky J and Maple in the Rye. The cranky j was refreshing but I really enjoyed the nuttiness of the maple in the rye.For appetizers we tried the deviled eggs with candied bacon and the 12 minute cheddar biscuits.  The eggs come in QTY 5 and were a nice flavor bomb of creaminess with a hint of spice topped with the sweetness of the candied bacon. The biscuits, OMG these biscuits were heavenly. Comes in QTY 2 and they are just pillowy warm soft goodness. It came with some. Super airy whipped butter that just soaked right into the warm biscuits. Mannn they were too good. I'll say it loud and proud, DO ORDER THE 12 MIN CHEDDAR BISCUITS!For the main we went with the 36 oz tomahawk ribeye with blue cheese potatoes and garlic roasted trumpet mushrooms. Wowsers! The beef was juicy and flavorful. The fat was melt in your mouth goodness. The trumpet mushrooms were loaded with umami and the potatoes soaking up all that meat juice just got better and better. We ate everything on the plate (except for the bone haha)For dessert we decided on the coconut pudding with roasted pineapple and topped with espresso caramel. OMG! The pudding so velvety and that espresso caramel was amazing. That was heaven in a jar.shout out to Calley who made the experience super pleasant with her friendliness, attentiveness, recommendations, and overall positive attitude. Nothing but positive things to say about this place. Oh one more, they also validate your parking! Can't wait to return!</p>
<p>My first visit here the food was great. Gave it a stellar review, this was 3 years ago. My most recent visit was for my anniversary. In my reservation, I mark that it is an anniversary.  Upon arrival my seat is a small table in the midst of chaos. With those metal patio/garden seats that your grandmother would have in her flower garden. I'm dressed up in heels so this seating is absolutely unacceptable for a romantic dinner. The staff was kind throughout the entire experience. They are the reason I'm giving this place as many stars as I am. No problem to move our seats to a padded booth like table with heaters! Thank goodness because it was freezing. I'd even gotten gum on my jacket and our waiteress brought me soda water to help. The gentleman who brought out our food were kind, pleasant, looked happy like they liked working there. So that was nice.But the food, for the price.. Charcuterie for starters. Very basic. I suppose maybe I'm a pro now and get disappointed when the boards I make at home blow away restaurants. We weren't told aforehand, what meat or cheeses we were going to get. Which only makes me upset that I forgot to even ask because I do not like prosciutto and most places love the pile it on the board. There were no olives this time which was disappointing too. Dried figs, ehh. And there wasn't enough bread provided. I ordered the short ribs that came with a pasta. My pasta was one big blop of carb. Every noodle stuck together and started hardening. I literally cut through the noodle like a potatoe. The short rib meat was good, a bit too salty but good. The carrots and sauce I could have done without. I understand the flavors they were going for but there wasn't enough sauce and If you are gonna give spice give it!  Id rather have had a brown gravy/sauce with the short rib.My date had the filet mignon, be cautioned read the menu! He missed it came with these thinly sliced layers of potatoe and Beet! He hates beets so upon investigating what it was on the plate by taste he was over it and had to order a side of their smash potatoes. Which were under seasoned. They boil fingerlings then give them a light fry after and toss a shake of parm on them. I recommend just getting fries (they don't have mashed potatoes!).  His steak was perfect! The chard melody, oh boy! Someone dropped the salt box in it. Was hypertension on a plate. Overall wasn't what I'd hoped for a sentimental dinner a big difference to our original visit to this spot. I think this place is more of a neighborhood cocktails spot.</p>
<p>Such a beautiful patio - one of my faves. Why is there such a lack of patio spaces on the valley? Their menu is great and everything is delicious. Sometimes the service is a little slow but not so much that I won't come back again and again. Both dinner and brunch are fantastic. Highly recommend trying the deviled eggs. The flatbreads are awesome. The burger is terrific. Definitely make a reservation. It gets crowded!</p>
<p>It's been a few years since I've been here... still as great as ever! HH is still fire. Everything is such at a feasible price. Devil eggs and burger is my fav.  The drinks are strong. The ambience is inviting and setting. It's a good place to relax and enjoy a good meal a long work day or a good weekend celebration. I always recommend this place to out of Towners or even locals. I feel like they need to stay up with the trends and post more reels on IG. Or just being active. Most people didn't know they still exist after seeing my IG stories.</p>
<p>Cozy and good beers with tasty food to go alongside the libations.Stop by even if you're not staying in the Beverly!</p>
<p>Great ambiance, food is pretty good.  Free parking with validation and service is good too.</p>
<p>Beauty & Essex nails it every time. The place has this trendy, dim-lit vibe that sets the mood just right, especially if you're gearing up for a night out. And the food? Spot on. Their pizza? A must-try. It's quickly become one of those places I just can't pass up. If you're looking for a spot that combines ambiance with killer eats, Beauty & Essex should be on your list. Trust me, it's worth it.https://loanlightyears.com/</p>
<p>Cool trendy spot in Hollywood. I came here for my birthday with two other friends on a Saturday night. Although we made reservations we still had about a 30 minute wait. When we were seated the section we sat in was a little quiet compared to the rest of the restaurant you really could not hear the DJ. After a while they eventually turned up the music and it was better. For the food, we ordered everything tapas style and shared. The scallops were probably my favorite followed by the mini Grilled Cheese Dumplings. Kale and Apple Salad was really good we ordered two of them because we were really hungry.  We also got the Truffle Mac which was decent. We honestly ate a lot of food between the three of us. I would say don't bother with the cupcake dessert. We had one of them and it was a little dry. Otherwise the atmosphere and small plates were delicious. Great opportunities for photos ops!</p>
<p>After staring at the menu of Beauty and Essex at the Cosmpolitan, my blushing bride decide that we would celebrate a special family event at Beauty and Essex in Hollywood. We highly respect Chris Santos from his demeanor and knowledge as a TV cooking show judge. It's clear that his staff reflects these virtues!The experience was actually very nice and we had a great family celebration. Nikoly helped us navigate the menu, whcih I found iniitally to be a bit daunting. His initial focus was on the apps and other one-bite dishes, each at about $5/bite. I've never added up the total number of bites my family needs to get a filling meal but it would be a lot... like a really lot! He quickly helped us formulate a plan for a family meal that included a combination of apps, main courses, and side dishes. I really respected how Nik represented both his employers interests and ours in a completely responsive and professional manner.First item were drinks, and all were really well-made. The cocktail list is interesting, innovative, yet familiar enough to not be scary. Apps were baguette and burrata, which both were fantastic. I must admit that I'm a bit uncomfortable with a 12-dollar baguette but that's not too unusual in this day and age.For dinner we shared the half chicken, scallops, potatos bravas and lobster mac&cheese. For me the clear winner was the chicken, which rivaled that experienced at Thomas Keller's Bouchon. I wasn't too thrilled by the mac& chese, though. I thought it was quite underwhelming but the family loved it so I must be wrong.  :)For dessert we saw a clear diversion of intent. I ordered a 1/2 dozen oysters and the family ordered the Wonder Wheel.  The oysters were absolutley fantastic: small, fresh, perfectly shucked, and very tasty. The variety of dessert bites on the Wonder Wheel was also quite good and the wheel itself made for a really fun experience.Only one thing that made me a bit uncomfortable and the reason why this is 4-stars rather than 5. We were seated in the booth adjacent to the kitchen door. All staff members moved silently and we barely noticed their comings and goings. Except for one gentleman waiter. I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable at the way he looked at us each and every time he passed, seemingly with a sneer. He wasnt' our waiter and I couldn't figure out why he was even looking at us and even more couldn't figure out why he seemed to have some sort of attitude. I'm trying to not take it personally but...</p>
<p>Vegan review: I was brought here for a dinner date on a Friday evening. The entrance is through an alley with some cute mirror photo ops. The front room has the appearance of a pawn shop. Then you walk through a lobby to the bar, main dining room, and patio seating. We were seated inside the main dining room. It has a romantic upscale boujee ambiance, exactly what I had hoped for. Heads up, the lighting is very dim, though there's at least a candle at each table. Some people were dressed more casually and others nicer. I was in a long evening gown and did not feel out of place at all. When I asked the waiter about the vegan options, he brought out a separate menu for vegan dishes only, which is super awesome! It eliminated all the hassle and guesswork so I could just order and enjoy my meal without worry. The waiter told us that guests typically order a few dishes and share, so keep that in mind. Our server Omar was great and they were super on top of refilling our water. The Thai BBQ Mushroom dish was served on fried rice cakes with a broccolini slaw on the side and topped with sesame seeds. Two waiters separately told us it was their favorite vegan dish on the menu so I had to give it a try. It was very flavorful and perfect for fellow mushroom lovers. My friend rated it 8.8/10The Roasted Heirloom Carrots were served with a coconut cream. The carrots weren't hot when they arrived to the table, which didn't bother me, but just wanted to note. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I didn't know carrots could be that delicious. The cream was so good too. My omni friend tried both of the vegan dishes and enjoyed them very much too. He ordered the deep dish pizza with pepperoni. He's a harsh pizza critic, and gave this a 7.7 rating (10 being absolute perfection cooked by God himself). He also got the Woodsman cocktail and said it was damn good and they didn't skimp on the alcohol. The pricing was what you'd expect for a place like this in Hollywood. Fair for the location, service, etc. Making reservations was easy and valet parking was super close by and worth it for this area of Hollywood. Overall, perfect spot for a fancy dinner in LA. A++ service for vegans! I would definitely come back again, maybe on Sundays when they have live jazz. My friend rates it an 8.7 overall experience. Now this may sound weird, but do not skip out on a trip to the toilet! The ladies room has a glamorous pink and silver lounge where they were serving complimentary champagne. It would be such a cool spot for a little hangout and pics with the girls. I felt like I stepped into an alternate universe or movie, it was a side quest in and of itself. One more thing, as a party of two, we were placed along the wall, one seated on each side of the table. My friend on the wall was sharing couch seating with one person in the party seated beside us. This was just a bit odd and a little too close for comfort in my opinion. It was okay and didn't bother me too much but it took away from the intimacy. There was enough space that it didn't feel like we were on top of each other but enough to feel like it was encroaching on our privacy a bit. I think if they were two chairs instead of a couch it would feel less weird. I could imagine someone larger being uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Wow.  What a great night we had!  We went for DineLA on a friday night.  The valet parking was a whopping $20, but the valet was friendly and it IS Hollywood.  Many of the patrons and the hostesses look like they are club goers.  I thought that we might be a little out of place, but no one made us feel that way.  In fact, service was TOP NOTCH on every level.  Every single employee that we interacted with was friendly.  We felt very welcome.  Amazing.  The atmosphere is excellent.  You get the Speakeasy theme right away and there are a lot of Gatsby vibes with the extensive bead decorations.  Lush...that's a good word for it all.5/5 - 24oz Bone-In Ribeye:  Seasoning was EXCELLENT!  So much flavor and perfectly cooked and tender.  My new #1 steak.5/5 - Cookies & Cream:  House made chocolate chip cookie with a boozy milkshake shot.  I'll take a carafe please!5/5 - Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings:  Delicate dumpling.  The flavors are delicious, but it doesn't really taste like grilled cheese.  Doesn't matter though...I would definitely get this again.4/5 - Berries & Cream:  Butter cake, farm fresh berries and chantilly.  A little dry, but much better with the fruit and cream.4/5 - Skirt Steak Frites:  In roasted garlic-bacon sauce and served with garlic aioli.  Some parts were excellent, but other parts of the meat were chewy.  The sauce was great.  The fries were thin and crisp, but the seasoning was a bit overwhelming in spots.4/5 - Butter Basted Scallops:  shrimp and saffron rice, peri peri sauce, crispy linguica.  Scallops were cooked perfectly.4/5 - Burlesque Show:  Traditional Old Fashioned3/5 - Woodsman:  Pear muddled Old Fashioned.  A little too sweet.3/5 - Kale & Apple Salad:  My husband enjoyed this, but I was not a fan.  Apple Cider Vinaigrette, pancetta, candied pecans, shaved goat cheese. 1/5 - Mexican Street Corn Ravioli:  The description says "roasted pompano creme, cotija, cilantro lime butter".  They do not mention whatever sweetener they added.  This was not corn-sweet, it was like honey-sweet.  No thank you.  I did not get the Mexican Street Corn flavor from this.  Disappointed.The food and drinks came out to 3.8 stars.  I happily round up to 4 stars for the excellence of the top dishes.  The service and atmosphere blows that up to 5 stars.  When I come back, I know how to get all 5 star food.  Looking forward to it!</p>
<p>Absolutely delighted with my experience at Beauty & Essex! Amiah, our waitress, provided top-notch service, enhancing our dining pleasure. The food was beyond incredible--every dish we ordered was a culinary delight. The atmosphere exudes sophistication, and the playlist is nothing short of amazing. I absolutely loved every aspect of Beauty & Essex, making it a solid 5-star dining destination!</p>
<p>I've been eyeing Beauty & Essex for a while. It has prime real estate on one of Hollywood's hottest blocks, and has been a staple to the scene since it opened. Now was this the best dining experience I have had? No. But I did have nice time spent with my girlfriend celebrating our anniversary. Don't get me wrong, the food is good! We had the steak frites, tuna tartare tacos, and grilled cheese soup dumplings. All of which tasted great, but aside from the surprise hit in the dumplings, I can't say this was a very memorable meal. The restaurants biggest issue is in its menu. It's just too basic. The apps are the most unique options on the menu and what stood out the most. The grilled cheese dumplings are a must have anytime you visit. Aside from that, I can't give any glowing recommendations on what to order from the mains. We kind of just kept reading and were like, is that it? While what we received tasted very appetizing, I think there's room for improvement for the restaurant in how creative they are with their entrees. The inside is a bit cheque, riding on the verge of tacky without any eye popping qualities in terms of design. It's incredibly dim, but there are some cool chandeliers that caught my eye. It draws the crowd you would expect, so at least they know who they're catering to. Beauty and Essex was fun and it's suitable destination for a one-time visit for an easy date night (at least the prices were fair!), but I would probably have my reservations in going back.</p>
<p>Overall, I had a great experience at Beauty & Essex. The ambiance is incredible, and we happened to visit on a Sunday night when there was live jazz music, which was an amazing surprise. The food is divine, and the menu is meant to be shared. They had a nice selection of drinks, and I opted for a black tea-based mocktail to start off our meal. I think the appetizers are the real star of the show here, including the mini French dip sandwiches and grilled cheese, smoked bacon & tomato soup dumplings. It's a really unique variety of items and the 2 we tried were delicious. I also thoroughly enjoyed the steak frites as a main course. Ours came out a little rarer than we asked for, but the flavor was great and the thin fries were perfectly crispy. Finally came the desserts, which were similarly extravagant and fun.Our service was not the best. We visited early on a Sunday night so it was not that crowded, but there were times where I felt like we didn't see our server for ages. But overall it was a wonderful evening!</p>
<p>We had visited the bar and lounge of this beautiful restaurant in Hollywood before. I really liked the strong and tasty cocktails. Of course the cocktail prices have increased drastically after pandemic. Champagne prices were not bad to my surprise. They offer impressive gluten free and vegan menus. We really liked the eclectic dishes with an Asian fusion twist. The patio seating was very relaxing and spacious with beautiful potted plants. It was jazz Sunday but the entire restaurant was kind of empty. They didn't even need to open the upstairs dining area. For food we decided on fresh oysters, Thai shrimp, Branzino, filet mignon and broccolini. The food tasted fantastic and so flavorful. The portions were on the bigger side. We loved the dessert wheel in the end and it was fun to try them all. Our drinks were very well made and tasty too. We really enjoyed our dinner with jazz music in the background. It was a lovely evening for hubby and I. Our server was so friendly and attentive, in fact all staff were very welcoming and pleasant. I was glad that Beauty & Essex didn't disappoint, Tao group is really up to their game! We will definitely be back whenever we want a special dinner in Hollywood!</p>
<p>I recently visited this trendy spot in the heart of LA, , jewel-toned eatery with vintage decor offering New American plates, drinks & wine and it instantly won me over with its chic atmosphere and inviting outdoor patio. The veg options, including the margherita pizza, burrata, patatas bravas, and street corn ravioli, showcased a delightful blend of flavors. To top it off, I ventured into the world of zero-proof cocktails, savoring the refreshing mint lemonade and the intriguing platinum peacock, both of which exceeded my expectations. A noteworthy perk is their valet service, making the overall experience seamless. Highly recommend for a stylish and satisfying evening.</p>
<p>My husband and I had a reservation Saturday evening. We arrived at 5:45pm and we were seated at 6pm in the upstairs dining room to the right. We were the first party to be sat there. The ambiance was nice, darkly lit and romantic. Very LA fine dining vibe. More parties were seated in this dining room section and the noise definitely picked up, it was hard to hear yourself talk.Honestly, I was ready to give this restaurant 1 star and leave before ordering our food. We waited almost 25 minutes for someone to take our order. We watched 4 parties who came after us get their orders taken AND we watched them get their drinks and food delivered to their table. Not sure if they were under staffed tonight, but this was very frustrating since we had to make our showtime for the Pantages and I was worried if our food would come out in time. We made eye contact with two staff who would circle around the dining room, but they seemingly were just in charge of refilling water.My husband talked me down and finally, our waiter approached our table. My husband politely informed him that we have been waiting for a while to place our order and would have to leave soon to catch our show. Our waiter kindly apologized and he did do his best to remedy the situation.As soon as we put in our orders, I got up to use the bathroom and by the time I got back, all the food was already there on our table. They even gave us an extra complimentary dish of meatballs. This gesture and the swiftness of getting our food quickly to us was very much appreciated.We ordered:- Braised chicken meatballs 5/5: juicy, tender meat and strong flavor with creamy truffle sauce- Classic Thick Cut Filet 4.5/5: the steak on its own was very flavorful and came out perfectly medium rare, sauces were just okay- Baguette with garlic chive butter 3.75/5: bread was warm and soft with a crunchy crust; butter was creamy and easy to spread, but the taste kind of reminded me of AMC popcorn butter which isn't a bad thing- Mac and cheese with shrimp and lobster 2/5: Al dente pasta, saucy had a nice creamy consistency but there was absolutely no flavor to it; the only flavor came from the lobsterWe also ordered drinks. The Beauty Elixir was just okay, it tasted just like a glass of champagne but with a frothy consistency from the strawberry and cucumber pulp yet no hint of the fruits' flavor. My husband liked his drink though the Spicy Crush.Overall, I strongly give this restaurant 3 stars. The food borders between decent and good. I don't think it's worth its very expensive price point to warrant a second visit. Our server was kind and tried his best to make up for our situation. I just really wish the restaurant would have a better system of attending to guests once they are seated in the order they arrive.</p>
<p>A really beautiful restaraunt, but the food fell short. Neither myself or any of the 4 people I was with enjoyed their meals. While I usually would give places a second chance, after trying 4 separate meals and not enjoying one, I think it's safe to say the food is just not good.</p>
<p>The restaurant has a nice hip, warm vibe with music playing in the background whether you sit inside or outside. There are plenty seating options courtyard, main dining room, and bar.  The food is innovative, tasty and delicious. All the dishes are great for sharing and you can add on additional pieces to the plates. We had the Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings (a must try), Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos (a must try), Little French Dips(just ok), Lamb Chops (super tasty), Rib Eyes (just alright), Branzino fish (really good), Chocolate Peanut Butter Cake, and the 'Berries & Cream' butter cake (our favorite). We also got a side of Patatas Bravas (Baby Yukon gold, guajillo sauce) super tasty and should also be on the list to try.</p>
<p>Location: adorable perfect for pictures mainly in the entry area it's all about the estetics! Food is yummy 9/10 my hubby likedThe steak but it was limited options and he loves tender cuts. Seafood options are good and cocktails are strong! I' would return for bday celebration but plan for small parties. The area is small and limited space when sitting. Girls night out I think is more of the vibe I got!</p>
<p>Beautiful and fun restaurant to dine at, before a show at The Pantages. It's a quick 10-minute walk from the theater, but watch out for the many homeless encampments, along the route. Seen a dude with a knife. Entrance was a little hard to find, it's off Selma, not Cahuenga. The entrance is cool. Looks like a pawn shop, but opens into a beautiful dining area. We sat upstairs and it was still early, so it was like we had a private dining area, but eventually filled up by the time we left. We were celebrating a birthday, and I made note of that when booking the reservation, so there was a happy birthday note on the menu, upon being seated. So nice!The service was great, from entrance through the entire meal, very friendly staff. The food was delicious and cocktails were refreshing. The bread sounds simple, but it was perfectly toasted on the outside, pillowy on the inside, with a garlicky butter. Steak was perfectly cooked, but less of the sauce would be better, because it's tender and flavorful enough, so doesn't need a lot of sauce. The Japanese fries were bomb, get them! We ordered the chocolate mousse dessert and it came with an edible birthday chocolate note and candle. Cool spot, would come back and try more dishes.</p>
<p>Fantastic!!Stand out service!  Everyone, from the door man to the busier gave superb service. The ambiance is very slick/cozy/warm. The food A++++. The chicken meatballs were out of this world. My mum loved the Tomato soup/grilled cheese. This is my first time going so I wasn't truly aware that it was like a tapas place. So, order to share and make sure to order enough if you've got a big appetite. This sort of dining is my favorite  Definitely a must go, especially if you're headed to the Pantages (about 5 blocks away. Yes we walked to the theater).</p>
<p>I recently dined at Beauty and Essex in Los Angeles for my friends birthday and it was an absolutely stunning experience. From the moment I walked in, I was transported to a glamorous and chic world. The decor is simply stunning, with glittering chandeliers, plush velvet seating, and stylish accents everywhere you look.As for the food, it was simply amazing. The drinks were strong and enjoyable. The menu features a wide range of delicious dishes, from classic comfort food to more upscale options. Once we left, we definitely left full and satisfied. What we ate:Appetizers:Kale & Apple saladGrilled cheese & tomato soup dumplingsTuna poke wonton tacosBeauty & Essex Cheeseburger slidersEntree:Oven braised chicken meatballsRoasted salmonSides:Mac & CheeseTogarashi FriesDesserts:Berries & creamMilk shake shotsThe service was also top-notch. Our server was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu, and the rest of the staff were equally professional and helpful.Overall, I highly recommend Beauty and Essex to anyone looking for a truly special dining experience in Los Angeles. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or just looking for a night out with friends, this restaurant is sure to impress.</p>
<p>My first visit was Mother's Day 2023. Valet parking was very easy to miss, we ended up in front of the hotel and had to make another loop around the block to get into the right area. Coincidentally the "right area" was in the middle of the street. The guy at the valet gave us a ticket, put our keys in the car and then ran off to move other cars that arrived after us. My husband stayed back for more than 10 minutes waiting for his car to be parked. He watched as other cars were moved before his. He alerted the valet one more time about his car and was assured that the car would be safely parked. We were promptly seated at our table. Water was offered immediately. It took another 20 minutes for a server to come and he only took a drink order. It was another 20 or so minutes for the waiter, Christian, to take our food order. The appetizer course came out in a decent amount of time but our entrees took forever. We were more than 2 hours into brunch before all of the food was delivered to our table.  We kept ordering bread because we were starving, I didn't realize each loaf was $12!  The chicken arepas was pretty good. I was shocked by the hot bottom part and the cold inner part. I'm not sure if everything was supposed to be the same temperature. I had the salmon, pretty small portion and very limited on the flavor. The server was really slow and most of the food was just ok. The ambience was cool, I'd love to check this place out at night when the kids aren't around. I would probably enjoy my 3 hour meal much more without entertaining young ones. The prices seem a little high since the food is wasn't amazing! Portions were small and I still left pretty hungry. We tried ordering additional food and drinks and decided to cancel once the 3 hour mark hit and nothing has been delivered.</p>
<p>What a great great find and let's talk about the decor... so cool. We had the tuna taco and  ravioli ... so yummy - will be back for more and try the Jazz night on Sunday as well. Did I mention the service was incredible and everyone seems happy and friendly there. Love</p>
<p>You can't go wrong with this spot if you're trying to have a nice dinner! Not too busy on a weekday and the ambiance is great. The seafood and steak frites were absolutely amazing, nothing was underwhelming. The drinks are tasty too. Only thing that was lacking was the service, waited for about 15 minutes for the check while our server kept passing us by. Otherwise the meal is def worth trying once.</p>
<p>Get the Margherita Pizza. Thank me Later. Best pizza I've ever had and I lived in Rome for 42 years. Simply divine. My sons loved it too and they don't like pizza at all. The wife and the kids never loved me more!</p>
<p>The pizza and the ravioli was my new favorite. Every bite of the ravioli came with an explosion of flavor and yummyness. The deserts were also great. So many textures and full of surprises</p>
<p>One of the real reasons it's hard for me to ever consider leaving LA...also somehow lost my review so here's take 2- everything is literally so good you can't go wrong.antipasto-the caesar salad- yum. eat it jenga stylethe scallop crudo. always a favebone marrow I didn't get but I did last time and it comes with a pasta and. yum!pasta-you actually can't go wrong but we went with a spicy tortellini which was incredible. and. the sweet corn ravioli with lobster and little trout or salmon roe. so balanced. so flavorful.pizza -we got the Giancale and the burrata. both were so deliciousmains-branzino. comparable to bavel. so goodpork. came with cabbage and it was delicious. so so tender.desserts-I bet everything is good. we got the strawberry tart which was so good and the peaches and cream and the red maple something like hot little doughnut-beignets with some ice cream.you just can't go wrong here.</p>
<p>Had a lovely time at Bestia.  Incredible, fun and hip atmosphere.  Sat at the bar as we stopped by without reservations and it was pretty busy. The food was really enjoyable.  We ordered the following: Peruvian Scallop Crudo - which was so fresh and citrusy.  Served with rosemary chili oil, cured cucumber, gaeta olives, mint and sesame. This is a light and refreshing appetizer which you will enjoy very much.Housemade Buttermilk Ricotta with aged balsamic, fennel pollen, herb oil, lava salt. Served with grilled bread.  This appetizer is so creamy and delightful.  We enjoyed every bite. Roasted Marrow Bone with spinach gnocchetti, crispy breadcrumbs and aged balsami.  The server will manually scrape the bone marrow into the pasta and stir it around.  The flavors are very satisfying and hearty.  We loved this dish. Slow Roasted Lamb Neck with smoked anchovy creme fraiche, gem lettuce and herbs.  I have been to their sister restaurant called Bavel which I had the lamb neck at.  I have to say I preferred Bavel's dish much more but this dish was still good.  It was a lighter dish as it is served with lettuce. Buttermilk Panna Cotta with roasted huckleberries and whole wheat butter cookies.  So creamy and delicious, I would definitely order this again. I would certainly recommend you try it and all their sister restaurants; Bavel and Saffey's as well.</p>
<p>We came on a Friday at 5:30pm. We made a reservation a month in advance, but it was pretty empty at 5:30. The restaurant front is in an alley and there's no big sign that shows Bestia outside.  For appetizers, we ordered the chicken gizzards and bone marrow. For entree, we got the Spicy Lamb Sausage Pizza and the Squid Ink Pasta. Our favorite was the Spicy Lamb Sausage Pasta, the crust was crispy and the sauce has a spicy kick. I liked the Squid Ink Pasta and enjoyed that it was cooked to al dente, but my friend thought it was too salty.  Chicken gizzards and the bone marrow were underwhelming. The Bar au Chocolat Bittersweet Chocolate Budino Tart was okay.The service here is superb!There is a 4% service charge.Valet parking is in the alley $12. We found free street parking across the street.</p>
<p>Been wanting to try Bestia for the longest time and finally got a chance to visit recently with some out of town friends. We had reservations for 830pm and only had to wait maybe 10-15mins to be seated on a Thursday night. The music indoor was a little too loud for so we opted for an outdoor table which was the move. They also had heated lamps but wasn't really needed as it was warm that night.We decided to do family style and ordered a few dishes for the four of us to share. We tried the following:Peruvian Scallop Crudo: 5/5 very refreshing! Great dish to start off dinner.Guanciale & Burrata pizza: 5/5 both were delicious. The crust was very tasty.Squid ink spaghetti: 1/5 Would not recommended. Very bland tasting compared to all the dishes.Chestnut & Mushroom Agnolotti: 5/5 Very flavorful and highly recommended!Duck: 5/5 Probably the best last dish we had. Very tender and flavorful.Service: 5/5 Server kept changing out our plates and utensils and kept our water filled.</p>
<p>Finally had the chance to try this place after years of it sitting in my bookmarks. I may have had high expectations but really was expecting more. Breakdown of dishes and experience as follows:Food:- Scallops - this was our first and best dish. My wife and I were sitting right in front of the salad and cold foods section, eagerly watching the young lady meticulously put this dish together. The scallops were fresh and paired well with the coconut milk, micro greens, strawberry, and chili oil. - Herbs Salad - another great dish. This was a tower of greens with a healthy amount of tart dressing and shaved cheese. Just like the first dish, this resonated freshness. Bone Marrow - this was a disappointment. I was looking forward to this the most and was let down. When the dish is presented to you, the server scrapes the marrow out of the bone, onto a bed of spinach pasta. Personally, I really wanted to eat this right off the bone as this is part of the experience. I ordered bone marrow and not a pasta. Huge let down. - Spicy Lamb Pizza - a delicious pizza. The lamb was not gamey and the dough was very soft. The crust had a slight burn which added to the flavor as a whole. - Squid Ink Pasta w/ Lobster  - another disappointment. The pasta itself was not Al dented and the lobster had a very strong fishy taste to it. Both my wife and I left the lobster untouched which was unheard of. This place really needs to do better with their pasta dishes. Pork Loin - the pork tasted good and the bed of cabbage slaw was even better. This dish won't let you down. Overall, the food and dining experience was pleasurable but won't be rushing back anytime soon. A $300 bill for this could not be completely justified.</p>
<p>Amidst the romantic backdrop of Bestia's warm ambiance, my dining partner and I embarked on a culinary journey that left us with lasting impressions, earning this experience an overall 4-star rating.Food: 4/5We embarked on a culinary journey, starting with the Marinated Olives. These olives were a delightful opening act, impressively not overly salty, which allowed their natural flavors to shine.The Peruvian Scallop Crudo followed, and while it was undeniably delicious, the portions left us wanting more. The flavors were on point, but we wished for a more substantial serving.The Roasted Bone Marrow, served with gnocchetti, was a standout dish. The gnocchetti balanced the richness of the bone marrow beautifully, creating a harmonious blend of flavors and textures.The Spicy Lamb Sausage Pizza, while decent, didn't quite reach the heights of the other dishes. It was enjoyable but not exceptional.Cavatelli alla Norcina, featuring pork sausage and black truffle, was tasty, but again, the portion size left something to be desired. The flavors, however, were a testament to the kitchen's skill.Drinks: 5/5The Search and Destroy, a daiquiri-style cocktail, was a true highlight of the evening. It delivered on flavor, balance, and refreshment, making it a memorable drink.Dessert: 3/5We concluded our meal with the Strawberry Crostata, which was a unique dessert choice. While it didn't quite reach the level of amazement, it offered a pleasant and interesting conclusion to our dining experience.Service: 4/5The service at Bestia was attentive, and our server was knowledgeable about the menu. However, at times, there was a slight delay in getting our dishes, which prevented a perfect score.Atmosphere: 4/5The restaurant's atmosphere was vibrant and buzzing with energy, creating a lively dining environment. However, it was a bit on the noisy side, which may not suit those seeking a quieter dining experience.Overall: 4/5Bestia offers a compelling culinary journey with standout dishes like the Roasted Bone Marrow and the impressive Search and Destroy cocktail. While some portions were smaller than expected, and a few dishes fell short of amazement, the overall experience was positive. If you're looking for inventive cuisine and memorable cocktails in a lively setting, Bestia is worth a visit, especially for a romantic date night filled with flavor and flair.</p>
<p>Came here for my girlfriend and I's anniversary. Reservations are extremely hard to come by, so if you're looking at this place for a special occasion, I recommend you to book ASAP, even if it's a weeknight. You can always cancel a day beforehand, but make sure to secure your spot. Coming on a Tuesday night, I was surprised I could only reserve a time slot for 5:45PM.Now, is it worth the hype? If finances aren't an issue, definitely. Valet alone was $12, and you basically have to pay the fee if you plan on driving there. Is the place romantic? Heck no, this place is just a glorified busy restaurant. The noise levels are so loud that you have to raise you voice a good amount to be heard by someone across from you. I wouldn't be back here again to celebrate an anniversary - maybe a friends gathering or taking the in laws is more suitable. I would not consider coming back here -- definitely a novelty restaurant that can be checked off your list. Before a deep dive into their food, here are my recommendations:Bone Marrow - a must have for its delicious, juicy, flavorful taste. Cavatelli or Squid Ink Pasta - Best pasta you'll ever haveBranzino/Lamb - You have to order a secondiThe pizza is dismissable IMOAll the dishes are meant to be shared, which, as an Asian, felt really nice in a western restaurant.We ordered the Bone Marrow, Squid Ink Pasta, Branzino, Margarita Pizza, and a Search and Destroy cocktail. The Bone Marrow is a must have, simply due to how unique the flavor is. Although it came first as an appetizer, it definitely was the star of the entire course - the flavor is so hard to describe you'll just have to order it yourself. The Branzino is just a grilled bass that is seasoned to perfection - however it's hard to justify a grilled fish for $50. The Squid Ink Pasta packs a small punch due to the spice, but definitely one of the best pastas I've had in my life. The lobster was so soft and paired perfectly with the dish. The pizza was okay - I would definitely avoid their pizzas unless you absolutely want to order one. I think a pizza from Dominoes or Papa John's is better.Service was pretty good, our waiter cracked a few jokes and made us feel comfy. Keep in mind they have a surcharge which is revoke-able - only if you ask your waiter to prevent the charge. It's supposed to pay for the staff, but when you're selling a salad for $20, it's hard to justify that they need help paying their staff.Are the menu prices overpriced? Arguably so, but then again, you're going to a fine dining place recommended by thousands of people, so it's relatively justified. There are definitely some lowly practices here, but the food is definitely worth the visit.</p>
<p>First time at Bestia and it was an interesting experience. The tables are pretty squished together and we were seated right in front of the kitchen. Runners and waiters were directly behind us (based on how we sat) so we felt a lot of movement and heat coming from the stoves. It's a very intimate and loud setting. You can't really hear yourself or the person next to you.Overall, the food was delicious but portions are extremely small. They recommend you order several dishes to share.</p>
<p>This place pork soup is amazing. All foods are smell so good and taste is great. When you get some food in here you would get known how their foods are so fresh and clean this place.</p>
<p>New location for Jinsol Gukbap in southwest Koreatown.  More seating and everything is brand new since they opened just before Thanksgiving.  Suyuk and the Buchucheon are delicious as is the Gukbap (of course).  They also had delicious sun dae (blood sausage) which I don't remember from the 3rd St location.  Service was speedy and very friendly.  Convenient parking lot in the back, accessible off of Harvard.  Great to see a local business expanding and continue to offer deliciousness!</p>
<p>김치찜이 진짜 맛있고 고기도 많이 들어있어요  서버님들도 다들 친철하시고 반찬들도 아주 훌륭했어요!! 다음에 오면 다른 음식들도 먹어보고 자리가 넓어서 너무 편했습니다.</p>
<p>Delicious Korean pork bone soup restaurant with a new location on 8th street.This location has a parking lot right next to it, but it is valet only (and costs 2-3$). Street parking on a Monday night was too difficult to find.I came here for the pork gukbap, which comes with pieces of tender pork in a very rich and umami broth. The soup isn't seasoned, so you add salt, salted shrimp, and a red chili paste to taste. It comes with rice and rice noodles that you can mix into the broth. This is the perfect meal for a cold day outside.This location also has a lot more variety for its side dishes, it came with kimchi, white kimchi, pickled radish, and even raw marinated spicy crab. Overall this place meets the same high expectations as the original restaurant!</p>
<p>My favorite Pork soup restaurant in Korean town We had pork soup, spicy cold noodles, leek pancake and grill pork ribs Everything is so delicious The new location at 8th street is bright and clean and private parking lot is behind itThe server is so nice and smiling all the time and always come to check if we need anything</p>
<p>This place is sooooooo stinking good. Definitely recommend coming with friends so that you can order a lot and share!I love all of the broths. I found the broth of the boiled pork SUPER rich, and the meat was incredibly tender! The pancake was super crispy, the galbitang was savory and comforting, and the cold noodles were acidic and refreshing. Service is fast and kind. The place is very casual, so just go and have fun!</p>
<p>For how recently they've opened, they're already quite busy! We found that the quality of food and service was on par with their other location. We got the leek pancake, small pork belly, and yukgaejang (beef soup with shredded beef brisket). I don't recall getting spicy marinated crab as a banchan at their other location, so was pleasantly surprised when it was included with their usual lineup. The crab was fresh and the marinade was flavorful without being salty. It was honestly more tasty than some places that offer this as an entree. The rest of the food came out in a timely fashion, piping hot. The pork belly was really tender, with a nice balance of lean and fat. I like le that their noodles were the flat rice noodles because it prevented sogginess. The yukgaejang was what we expected, good but not necessarily their specialty. We were able to find metered street parking in front of the restaurant. They also have a small parking lot that offers valet for $2 during lunch and $3 during dinner.</p>
<p>Super clean inside. Very spacious. Really attentive service.The menu is slightly different from the 3rd St location but they said they will be adding more items slowly. It's a soft opening for now. Parking is valet.</p>
<p>Kimchi stew is very tasty and not too spicy. We also had a chijimi, and we really love them. We would like to come to eat here again! Thank you! ここのキムチ鍋は辛すぎでもなく、具材もたくさん入ってるのですぐお腹がいっぱいになりました。私のお気に入りのチヂミも安定に美味しかったです。</p>
<p>Holy shitTheir soup is divine.I tried their soup for the first time last week and I went back the very next day to have it again. We tried their small sooyuk too, which was pretty good too. I only did take out but i can tell their service is good. Definitely 5 stars and willing to visit pretty often.</p>
<p>I am so happy they opened up another location.The third street location gets real busy sometimes.I went to the new location last week and wow it is gorgeous. The restaurant is really spacious and the decor is such a vibe. The food is just as amazing as third street.I have tried almost everything on the menu and it all taste delicious. My favorite will always be the Sooyuk, but I do sometimes crave the Mul Naeng Myung. Service is top notch here too. I will be coming weekly :)</p>
<p>So happy to have a the best Korean hangover soup now on the south side of Wilshire! Jinsol is an OG Korean soup place from Busan Korea. The newly opened 8th st location has all the goodness of the 3rd St branch, with more seating and even Korean sausage soondae. Parking in the back, great service, and same quality that you would expect!</p>
<p>A hidden gem. Kimchi jjim was super delicious~ Jackie and Justin our servers were super nice and attentive :) definitely will be back</p>
<p>The Kimchi Jin was so bomb and it was a lot for two people! It was my first time here and  Jackie was such a sweetheart attending to us. I also like the different banchan that they serve.</p>
<p>Got the pork soup and LA short rib, food was amazing. Service is fast and nice. As a new location, everything is new and clean, new little gem in Ktown!</p>
<p>Amazing food and great atmosphere. Shout out to the managers Lyndsey and Leslie! Great service.</p>
<p>Loved this place! Came for dinner with friends, and food was amazing and drinks We're delicious. Loved the service, managers Leslie and Lyndsey are fantastic! Highly recommend!</p>
<p>Returned once again and enjoyed an A5 Wagyu and petite filet (both new from the last review. Both were delicious and the table side preparation of the A5 wagyu was a nice touch. Service was a bit worse than last time (took extreme amounts of time to get water, which makes you wonder why they just don't leave the water with you).Ambiance: 5/5Service: 4/5Drinks: 4.5/5Food: 5/5Value: 4.5/5Consistency: 4.5/5</p>
<p>Food:  overall tasty and well presented, though the portions could be a little bit more generous.Service:  very professional, prompt, and friendly. Ambiance:  upscale, a little bit on the darker side, fairly noisy, and not extremely spread out so you will usually have other people nearby. Unfortunately, the parking situation is not good.Value:  it's about $150 per person with drinks and dessert.</p>
<p>fabulosity at its finest  gracias para todo! 10/10 would recommend. The plantains win.</p>
<p>I love when a trendy restaurant delivers. I would suggest making reservations! We sat in the main area with the bar and a live DJ. Which made for great vibes. I love how they set up the drinks. I can't remember the name of mine but they delivered it to me lit on fire which was fun!My friends and I ordered a bunch of stuff and shared it. We got the Caesar salad which had a spicy dressing which made it delicious. We also got the salmon dish which was tangy and flavorful and the Mac and cheese side. To finish off they gave me a dessert for my birthday!</p>
<p>I've been here a couple of times and have enjoyed my time both times! The food is SO good and definitely worth coming back for! I love the ambiance and the fire shows that go on. The drinks are also super good! The only flaw is how we had to wait and got seated past our reservation time even when we came 10 minutes before our reservation time. Overall I would recommend coming here for a date night or a place to eat out with friends to have a good time!</p>
<p>Love coming here with friends! Great drinks, great vibes, and amazing service. The food quality is always amazing, and i recommend getting the steak tacos pictured!</p>
<p>Ok so seen this trendy spot on IG and also highly recommend. So we had to try it for ourselves . Ambiance- the whole place is really nicely decorated and the vibe and ambiance  is what you expect from a West Hollywood hot spot . They have a fire dancer putting in a show several times a night which is nice experience to see. The whole vibe is great Service- this is really where they stand out . Our server just went out of her way to explain to us the menu and had several suggestions . She helped us decide on drink and suggested great appetizers as well. She kept up with drinks and checked in on us often . Food- the food was just okay nothing that I would say I need to go back for . We had the enchiladas and the Carne asada and prawn . With the corn and cilantro rice. The good like I said was just okay . This is a fusion of a steak house meets Mexican food but not really big on steak selections . Overall the best part of this spot is the service and ambiance . If you want to hang out at a West Hollywood hot spot this is it for drinks and vibe .</p>
<p>This place is delicious!! Great customer service. We got the tomahawk with bone marrow, Mac n cheese, rice, and beans. Everything was delicious. The chef came out and seared the tomahawk and mixed the bone marrow in a salsa. So yummy!! The whole experience was great. The place was so beautiful. Nice place for a date night or celebration. Def returning for some good steak.</p>
<p>The food is amazing, it melts in your mouth. The drinks are outstanding if you order them directly from the bar not you waiter. I feel if you order your drinks and pay for them at the bar before you sit the bartenders put extra love as oppose if your waiter brings them. I noticed because I ordered a spicy margarita at the bar before everyone arrived and they put jalapeños on mine and let me tell you! It was delicious! My friend group ordered the same thing at the table and it was not the same. Maybe it was the tequila they used but they didn't even have the same garnish I did. Ambiance is a dark atmosphere, friendly staff, and the public seemed to be acting right. Nothing wild or crazy. I'd come back on a slower night if there is any lol just to eat the food.</p>
<p>The food here is delicious!!! Toca Madera means to touch wood or knock on wood and I find myself knocking on wood to stay as privileged as I've been to be able to eat here. The service was over zealous and ended up forgetting 2 of our accompaniments but the service aside you come here for the food. There was a big group next to us and they ended up more worried about them but who cares.The food and ambiance are awesome. We had a tomahawk steak, Mexican sashimi with sides of street corn, rice and beans and almost had carrots but those were forgotten. But that's ok, because we were full of tomahawk. To finish it all off we had the  Oaxacan chocolate. The ambiance is dope, great music, lights that could brighter and a cool chill vibe. It a great place to come with a group as you get better service and pay less per head. But all in all the steak is there with the best of them. Well worth the hype!Thanks for helping us celebrate 7 years of love and Toca Madera if we see you again.</p>
<p>Food is whatever. Drinks are okay except for one. We ordered some tacos and they were the size of my pinky. No exaggeration. $20 for two small ass tacos. I sent my drink back because it had way too much chili. Literally burning my throat and I LOVE SPICY. It was so bad. Basically, this place isn't worth your hard earned dollars</p>
<p>I love the place Thank you so muchI like the drinks I got the Vodka with coconut with pineapple. The barman is sweet !! Try the taco with sea bass . Super delicious</p>
<p>I felt like a V.I.P.The wife's birthday is today to to celebrate we slid on down to Los Angeles for dinner date. I sent her several options based on what she was looking for food wise and she did what I did on this one. After checking into our hotel, we made our way to Toca Madera upon arrival of our way. Let us know it would be $16 to use the valet service and we would pay or upon our departure from the restaurant, I did my research before heading down there so the $16 fee was no problem. Once we made it to the front door we were meant by two well dressed security man asking if we had a reservation again I did my research and made sure we had a reservation on file to which they said thank you and open the door, we were met with a large crowd, but very cool almost Jazz like atmosphere and vibes after speaking with a hostess and confirming our reservation we were taken to a table and seated. The chips and salsa was pretty good but I was here for the main course we started with, chicken, flautas and wild mushroom quesadillas which was very filling. We ordered a virgin Mojito and the Uno Momento for a drink. After that we will ordered the truffle mac & cheese, truffle fries, and 8 ounce flat stake. All of the food came out, relatively quickly, considering the crowd. The temperature was hot for the majority of the time spent in the restaurant due to the open flames and sizable crowd. Our table was right next to the DJ booth, so there was lots of loud music, but it was really good and kept the atmosphere light I put in the reservation instructions that It was my wife's birthday, and they made sure to bring out a little ice cream on top of a churro with a sparkler and happy birthday written in chocolate sauce on the plate. Classic. The bill was high, but again I was expecting this and I totally feel like I got my moneys worth. If you're looking to splurge and eat some really good food. This is the place for you. We look forward to our next journey to this location.</p>
<p>This place is the worst, I can't even describe how bad our experience was the customer service was terrible our server ignores us for like 20 minutes when he finally came to our table with a actitud we asked for drinks suggestions and he told us it depends what like you can see the menu he was very attentive with other table, passing by our table not even asked us if we need anything after a hour he bought us the check without even asking if we wanted dessert or anything else , I willNever go back the food was good drinks were good</p>
<p>Toca Madera review based on service, food, and environment:  The server I had wasn't very engaging, rather quiet, and lacked friendliness. The atmosphere was confined on a humid patio, and the space felt quite small. On a positive note, the DJ provided great music that added to the overall experience. The food and drinks were enjoyable.Additionally, it's important to mention that the parking situation was inconvenient during my visit, I had to use self parking and park on a parking structure where I was not provided with valet parking.Inconsistent service can certainly impact the overall dining experience. It's valuable feedback for the restaurant to consider for improving their customer service.</p>
<p>I'll start off by saying they have the most incredible drink menu. From the pictures to the drinks itself, it is extremely impressive. They offer a large variety of speciality cocktails, some which come flaming to your table. As for the food, it was nothing special. Presentation was lovely but for the price, I expected the food to wow me. Service was good and the atmosphere is fun. They have live DJ and music. I definitely suggest this spot for the drinks.</p>
<p>This place is fantastic. At Least for brunch cocktails. We had a pretty good time sitting at the bar and served by Devon and Donovan. We really enjoyed the ambiance of a an in house DJ.</p>
<p>Wow, I was pleasantly surprised by my overall experience this past Friday night with a girls' night out. The ambiance is definitely tulum vives, but the guitarist giving Lenny Kravitz tunes was so cool along with the DJ. The cherry on top was the amazing food from start to end, we started with the Hamachi, which was so fresh with the perfect blend of flavors exploding in your mouth. We ordered the fish and carne asada tacos, kale salad, chicken enchiladas with the corn, and truffle fries. I I have no complaints because it was great food, something that normally does not come with beautiful restaurants. The service was great. I didn't have to ask for multiple water refills, along with the timing of service was great. I almost forgot the churro dessert was soooo good, and just for that, I  would go back, but we all know that won't be enough. Can't wait to go back!</p>
<p>Hangari Kalguksu is a Korean noodle restaurant that has been on my radar for a very long time. I finally made it here on a weekend in November and wish I came earlier because the food here was superb. My husband got here around 1 pm on a Saturday. I got here later and the staff wouldn't seat him until I was there. There was a giant line at lunch time, so the place is clearly popular. The restaurant is in a strip mall so I wasn't expecting it to be nice inside, but the ambiance was pretty modern and trendy. We were brought water and menus immediately. The staff came around quickly to take our orders and we didn't have to wait long to get our food. Kalguksu is a Korean noodle dish that means knife-cut. I ordered the spicy seafood Kalguksu and was very happy with it. The noodles were fresh with a nice chewy texture. I could tell they'd been handmade. The seafood was fresh and the soup was actually quite spicy. They had a variety of different Kalguksu noodles on the menu, including meat and seafood varieties. My husband got the beef bulgogi but he regretted not getting one of the noodle dishes when he tasted mine. I do think the bulgogi here was very good but the noodles are their speciality. The service was friendly but pretty brisk. There was a line of customers outside the whole time we were eating so it's not a place you can really eat and linger even though the ambiance is nice. I'll definitely be back and would recommend coming here if you're craving a hot bowl of noodles.</p>
<p>So many good restaurants in Ktown, so little time, money, and stomach space. With a tight schedule on LA trips, you KNOW that I make each meal count. Hangari Kalguksu (as well as its neighbor Yangji Gamjatang), are frequent haunts for me. I dropped by with a friend for lunch a few Fridays ago for massive, steaming bowls of kalguksu, perfect for a chilly day. My friend and I got the spicy seafood kalguksu and the chicken kalguksu. Service was pretty quick and attentive. The chicken one literally came with half a chicken, and the meat was so tender, even the chicken breast!! The noodles were hand-cut with great texture, and the soup was absolutely addicting and perfectly thick. I loved the added black pepper and green onion, which complemented the rich soup nicely. I normally like my noodle soups spicy, but this one was perfectly stick-to-your-ribs hearty, and I didn't miss spice at all. The seafood soup was spicy and had a good kick without being agonizing. With hot liquid, adding too much spice makes the dish too painful for me to eat, but this one was perfectly balanced. I think I preferred the chicken kalguksu more, but the seafood kalguksu was still a very good dish with tons of seafood including squid, shrimp, and half a crab.Prices have gone up since COVID but their portions are also huge. My friend and I were stuffed but still had leftovers to take to-go. There isn't only a ton of noodles, but oodles of vegetables as well. Definitely one of my favorite kalguksu places in LA!</p>
<p>During my recent visit to Hangari Kalguksu noodle shop in Koreatown LA, I experienced a somewhat of a wait and line, especially during peak hours. However, the efficient and fast customer service helped alleviate any frustration.I opted for the beef bulgogi rice dish, but I found it to be on the salty side. Despite this, the other offerings, particularly the noodles, were exceptional. The noodle dishes showcased a delightful combination of flavors and textures, making them a standout feature of the menu.The ambiance of the restaurant was inviting, providing a cozy setting for a casual meal. The staff's attentiveness and quick service stood out positively, contributing to an overall pleasant dining experience. Despite the minor setback with the salty beef bulgogi, the variety of well-executed noodle dishes makes Hangari Kalguksu a notable spot in Koreatown LA.</p>
<p>It's always a good time when you're at Hangari. I've tried the chicken kalguksu which is delicious, but my friends and I decided to try the seafood kalguksu today with the large bossam to top it off. The seafood kalguksu was packed with clams, mussels, shrimp, and crab ~ very satisfying but I'm more of a chicken gal so I'll probs opt for it next time I come. The star of the show was surprisingly the bossam, it was amazing! Props to the chefs for cooking the pork belly so well - it was very flavorful and tender, I would recommend for larger groups. Since none of us have a huge appetite, it was plenty for the 5 of us. The interior is modern and great for catching up with friends/smaller groups. The only minus is that street parking is a little tough to find depending on when you come in the day, but there is valet parking available as well!</p>
<p>This bowl of chicken kalguksu was the deciding factor in choosing my ultimate favorite comfort food: chicken noodle soup. The noodles were so springy and I love knife-cut noodles because the bounciness adds so much texture. The broth was rich but in a refreshing way and was so good for my soul. I wish it came with more chicken though because the ratio of noodles to chicken was a little disheartening. That said, I would come over and over again just for this soup.</p>
<p>This place has so many reviews! And for a good reason. I'll just touch base on a couple things. The way goes by pretty quickly, so don't be intimidated by the line, they also take your order while you are in line. They are very efficient with cleaning up tables, seating people, serving food, etc. The portions here are large, we actually just ordered one item and shared between two people and it was just enough food.  I noticed people would order two items maybe one per person and a lot of people are taking left overs home. If you like clams, definitely try the clams it it is so delicious!</p>
<p>I didn't need a reservation for a group of three on a week night. We were seated right away. They brought us water, chopsticks, spoons, bowls, and napkins. After we ordered, they gave us side dishes, which were really good! Between three people, we shared three dishes: sujebi $16.99 (handmade "dough flakes"), bossam $45.99 (medium), and yulmu bibimguksu $16.99 (spicy cold noodles, no broth). All three dishes were sooo goood. Goddamn. I'm salivating thinking about them. Sujebi - perf for cold night. Soup is tasty. Noodle cake (?) (as opposed to calling it a rice cake lol) is chewy. Delicious veggies. We paid $1 to make it extra spicy, and it was def spicy! Bossam - fatty pork, raw garlic, lettuce, add the pickled radish and some sauce. Mmmmmm. Yulmu Bibimguksu - tasted sweet but delicious noodles and thin cold cucumber slices. Service was good. They refilled our water pitcher a couple times. They took away our empty dishes. They even refilled our side dishes when we asked. They bring the check to you. No bell system that I could see. Parking: the private lot has valet, but I strongly recommend against even driving into the lot. It will most likely be full. Sometimes you may end up blocking the traffic on the street. Try finding free street parking in the area instead.</p>
<p>I've been here twice with my best friend and we've been lucky both times with being seated quickly.  This place can get very popular and parking is always crowded -- street parking is your best option. We ordered the chicken noodle soup and medium bossam. The chicken noodle soup is creamy yet thick but so satisfying.  The seasoning is on point.  The bossam is so good! This is a must try. Adding the cabbage, jalapeño, meat, garlic and radish together sends a flavorful mixture to your tastebuds! On a hungry day, we usually finish both items!</p>
<p>I came here for dinner and wanted to try sujebi for the longest time. I was happy that they were able to swap the kalguksu for sujebi instead and I got the clam soup. The broth was so flavorful and the sujebi was delicious. I also loved the pumpkin in the soup. My friend got the spicy seafood kalguksu and he really enjoyed it too. He loved all the seafood inside and he said that the broth was delicious. I definitely want to come back to try their bossam because that looked delicious too. The line is also quite long so be prepared to wait if you come at prime time. They also take your order in line so by the time you get seated, your food will come quickly.</p>
<p>Hands down, my favorite restaurant in Ktown!!! The most hearty, comforting noodle soups ever. My favorite is the chicken kalguksu, which is the most flavorful bowl of chicken soup with hand-pulled noodles and half a cornish hen. I will NEVER get over the noodles here!! The noodles and generous portions - seriously 100/10. I recommend this restaurant to all my friends and family that visit from out of town. Service is also great and super efficient here. Street parking can be a bit of a challenge here, but they have a valet lot with very reasonable prices. A must-visit!</p>
<p>No Fees</p>
<p>Tried the spicy chicken kalguksu. So yummy!! Perfect dish for cold weather. Huge portion.Definitely recommend coming here since we are entering colder seasons.</p>
<p>If your in Korean Town, and feeling "Hungry" Los Angeles, be sure to check out Hangari. It's such a hidden gem! The moment you step inside, the cozy ambiance and the rich aroma of Korean cuisine, surrounded by people in their 20s-50s enjoying the food set the tone for a delicious dinner. The standout dish at Hangari Kalguksu has to be their Bossom. The succulent, perfectly cooked and melt-in-your-mouth pork belly is beautifully complemented by an array of fresh, crisp vegetables, garlic and jalapeños slices, and a medley of flavorful side dishes to go with. Each bite is a harmonious blend of textures and flavors, making it an absolute delight for the palate.The seafood soup is another must-try. This steaming bowl of goodness is full of flavor! Featuring a robust shellfish and crab flavor that's simply intoxicating. The noodles in the broth seems freshly made and has nice satisfying chew to it. The broth is rich and comforting, and it's generously filled with plump, juicy meat of seafood that will have you savoring every spoonful.Hangari Kalguksu in the heart of Korean Town, Los Angeles, is a culinary treasure that deserves a visit. Whether you're a fan of bossam, seafood soup, or simply crave authentic Korean flavors, this establishment is sure to leave you with a deeply satisfying and memorable dining experience.FYI... the parking here isn't that great, I would recommend either Ubering here or pay the valet $5 for them to park your car in the lot. Otherwise, street parking is very limited in the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Ktown staple in Alexandria plaza! There is usually a wait for lunch as it gets packed but came here solo for a quick meal. Ordered a small portion of their chicken kalguksu. Noodles had the perfect texture. Chicken was fresh. Love the addition of pumpkin in the soup, adds a beautiful sweetness to the dish. I'll never stop coming here for noodle soup.  Chicken kalguksu (small): $18.99</p>
<p>I am still dreaming about the bossam from Hangari! I came here for a late dinner with a few friends and everything exceeded expectations. The restaurant has a very cozy yet modern vibe. Even though it was a full house at 9pm, we were seated really quickly. The server was really nice and attentive. He recommended two dishes for our group. We ordered the bossam and the seafood noodles to share. The bossam was soft and tender, and the sides complemented the pork belly really well. I especially liked that the napa was blanched, which made it easy to fold little lettuce wraps. The seafood noodles had a really rich broth, and they did not skimp on the seafood. Both portions were really large and more than enough. My only issue with this place is the parking. The lot is really small so you will likely spend quite some time finding street parking. It's probably best to Uber.I will definitely be back!</p>
<p>Probably one of the worst experiences and expensive experiences thus farRestaurant was empty for a 300 PM weekday lunch The 1 star is for the server who made space for my Grandma's walker  Items either have no taste or overly spicyEverything is overpriced The most famous dish: the steamed pork belly slices was $48 for less than half a pond of pork and some raw vegetables around it for pairing 4 entrees was $154 dollars before tip Will not be writing a full review because it's just not worthy of even that</p>
<p>One of my go to places in ktown. They are super friendly and accommodating to our food preferences/restrictions and always make sure that what we order is correct, and it is! I am pescatarian and they always ask me to make sure if I want to eat certain foods/ let me know what ingredients are in which dish. Everything is super flavorful and delicious and very consistent!</p>
<p>Located in Koreatown Los Angeles. In a small lot and very busy but worth it. When you stand in line, they already have the menu for you ready to order. So that by the time they sit you down, it will speed up the process of getting everything out and served. Quick and friendly service! Minimal and industrial decor and love their "Check out my noods" sign.Known for their hand cut noodle soup. When you come here, definitely bring your friends or family or someone to share this deliciousness with because they serve up big portions! I underestimated what I ordered and made my friends help me.I got the Tokbokgi (rice cake and fish cake boiled in sweet red chili sauce with onion and egg). YOU GOT TO ADD THE MOZZARELLA CHEESE!!!! It is a must! Pairs well together. With the savory and sweet with the different textures from the dish. You get chewy, soft, thick, saucy, stringy.. Just a lot of textures but a flavor blast in itself. And you gotta love the cheese pull! So satisfying!!!!I also got the Seafood Handmade Noodle Kalguksu (anchovy broth with shrimp, crab, mussel, clam, zucchini, kabocha, and potato). You have the choice of spicy or non-spicy. I went with the spicy and it definitely had a kick to it! The broth was savory with a hint of sweet and a richness to it. The noodles were thiiiiiiiccck and slurpilicious. They give you a decent amount of veggies and seafood. The veggies were cooked well. I loooooove kabocha! You get the sweetness from it and a slight pumpkin soft texture to it. It works well in hearty and flavorful soups.Will be back again!!!! Cause I literally can't stop thinking about the noods.</p>
<p>Parking is always the challenge in this area. It's worth the circling or paying the valet if there is space. Fast and efficient service. Sometimes you have to wave down a server. Everything we had was simply authentic, tasty, and on point. Came here originally for the bossam, which is the best in K-town in my opinion but was equally impressed with the kalguksu and the sujebi. Can't wait to try more on their menu.</p>
<p>I've been waiting for an opportunity to try this place since forever but couldn't justify driving/parking/suffering in Ktown traffic. At least no until some friends came back to LA to visit. I ordered their non-spicy chicken kalguksu (닭칼국수 on menu). While my friends ordered the spicy seafood one. I tried some of their seafood kalguksu and it wasn't that spicy. Turns out you can ask for more heat. The chicken kalguksu was better than what I was expecting. The portion size is huge and theres a lot of chicken meat, potatoes, pumpkins, and knife cut noodles. The chicken meat was soft and moist. Soup base was very refreshing and didn't make me thirsty for water afterwards. The real goods was the knife cut noodles. They were the springiest noodles I've ever had. After sitting in t he soup for awhile, the noodles had the broth flavor too, making it even better.Overall, incredibly good food especially after an afternoon drinking session or during colder days. Service was great as we kept asking for more spice and they kept handing more to us. I would come often if traffic and parking in ktown wasn't horrendous.</p>
<p>The last time I was here was in 2019, and I've been thinking about their kalguksu ever since! I really wanted to try the kong guksu (noodles in cold soybean soup) but was too scared to commit so my friend very nicely ordered it instead while I got the plain kalguksu. I was not disappointed by my choice, the noodle texture was so good, and the serving size was also huge. Broth was flavorful, but didn't feel too salty or heavy. The kong guksu was very interesting, kind of reminds me of a soupy version of Taiwanese sesame noodles. It was very refreshing! I also liked their barley + ssamjang banchan, I have never seen that at a Korean restaurant before and it was quite tasty, The servers were also quick and attentive.I definitely would not recommend parking in the lot as it is very small and can get very congested. I usually park on the streets around the restaurant. I came for lunch on a Sunday and found street parking pretty easily nearby.</p>
<p>No Fees</p>
