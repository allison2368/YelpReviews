<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p>My gf &amp; I were walking around Treasure Island checking out the amazing views of SF. We were hungry &amp; figured we'd have to go into the city for food. Wrong! As we were returning to our car, we came across Mersea &amp; we are...lucky we did! 
First, the views are the best on the island! The view goes from the Bay Bridge to the Golden Gate Bridge, with the SF Embarcadero &amp; Alcatraz in between. You can even see Mt. Tam. Next, the place is super casual. The restaurant is built in a bunch of old shipping containers, randomly stacked next to each other with indoor &amp; outdoor seating.
The best part is the food! We were hungry, so we ordered way too much and took some home. Parke's fish chowder, truffle fries, fish &amp; chips, and the hamburger were all out of this world good! The food is super fresh &amp; you can tell the ingredients are all of the highest quality.  Too bad we left our pup at home; there's a separate menu for doggo's! Overall, a great experience and a very lucky find. We will be back!More</p>
<p>This is a fabulous spot!  Beautiful views!  The best fish and chips I’ve ever had!  Truffle fries, fish soup, everything was delicious!  Can’t wait to come back!!</p>
<p>Having lived in the Bay Area for 30+ years I regret not finding out about this place sooner. Treasure Island has such unique views of the SF skyline, from the waterfront to the Golden Gate Bridge all the way around to the Bay Bridge, 

Mersea...has a super laid-back vibe with incredible food and drinks and the most outrageous view of the SF skyline,  a full 270 degree water view with floor to ceiling windows. 

Daniel makes an incredible Manhattan, and the poke was super fresh.  Meesun was an amazing hostess and made sure we ordered all the house specials…Truffle fries, Fish and Chips etc etc. Mmmmm!! We will definitely be back soon!More</p>
<p>Long time diner, first time reviewer. I’ve been coming to Mersea for years and it never fails to impress.  My go to is the fish and chips but I sampled several other dishes on my last visit. The fish chowder was the best that I...have ever had with large delicious chunks of fish and vegetables that melted in my mouth. The cauliflower, fish tacos, carnitas tacos, and brownies were also fantastic! I ate way too much and it was totally worth the trip. I will be back again very soon.More</p>
<p>The view, the staff, the ceviche and the fish &amp; chips were the best I've encountered in years! My new favorite place to escape Marin and the city and enjoy a moment of island life!</p>
<p>My brother-in-law loves Fish and Chips.  We heard that Mersea on Treasure Island had the best in the area.  The rumors were accurate.  The portion was huge and delightfully crispy on the outside (they make it with Haddock!!) and moist and juicy on the inside....The potatoes were authentic, but we still had to get the truffle fries.  The fish chowder was out of this world.  All in all, a great experience that will be repeated.More</p>
<p>The food is always great! I always start with the chowder and the rest of the menu is just delicious,all pleasingly so. Great location, usually enjoy an afternoon, and walk the island perimeter, then back to Mersea for another sipping of something hot or cold...(desert) before heading on. Have been coming here for years since just before landscape by the Half Moon Bay Gal started showing up. Beautiful , (check it out) ! Kids and Pets friendly! (See Check Please Bay Area episode) , how I discovered Mersea! Thanks for being there! Yours,R.F. Napa,caMore</p>
<p>I'm not sure how this place has been rated so high.  Fish and chips were flavorless and mushy, and potatoes were bland and cut way too big for my taste. Husband had Poke bowl, looked beautiful,  trying to hard to recreate something that on its...own is spectacular and also bland. Service was decent, nice bar selection. Need some more shade.More</p>
<p>Nice people, great food and super location.
We went for a great lunch opposite dt San Fransisco.
Highly recommended if you have a car. Not much to see on Treasure island otherwise, except the view towards the city, but so much worth going for a...snack or lunch.More</p>
<p>We had a spectacular day at Mersea yesterday. It turned out to be one of the busiest days of the year on the bay “Fleet Week”! We had brilliant sunshine, sensational cocktails - LOVE the Margherita with cucumber and jalapeño was refreshing… while watching The...Blue Angels streak through the sky. The restaurant is located right opposite the city and Golden Gate Bridge - the perfect location for us foreigners - Australians and Germans to enjoy the best of SF bay! The Ceviche was delicious and enjoyed the  fish and chips! 
Drinks were quick and food a little delayed as it was such a popular spot that day but it all came out hot and fresh. The service so friendly. Thankful for a perfect day!More</p>
<p>When we have visitors, we take them to Mersea. When we are meeting friends we haven't seen in awhile, we take them to Mersea. When we need a break from San Francisco, we take ourselves to Mersea. 

We took friends from York, England to Mersea...Friday, September 22. The food was as spectacular as the view. To say they loved it, would be an understatement. They said that it was one of the highlights of their visit! 
Meesun, one of the owners, came by the table to check on us and chat. When she learned that our friends were from England, she returned with a sample of their fish and chips to see how it stood up to the British version. One friend who doesn't care for fish and chips, said he was converted by Mersea's. 

We were there for lunch. It was Friday and beautiful. There was a live band playing. Views, great food and friends. What more can you ask for? Another reason to come back</p>
<p>Thank you for not only one of the nicest reviews, but for your support of Mersea, our staff and a small business! We Truly appreciate amazing guests like you!! Your kindness is loyalty is how we are able to survive these very trying and challenging</p>
<p>We chose to eat here based off previous 5 star reviews and we’re so glad we did. Not only was the location fun with a great view of the city, but the staff were so friendly and the food was incredible. The owner chatted to...us, and made recommendations for her favourite items of the menu, bringing us things to try. We had a couple of cocktails, played cards and watched the sun go down. A lovely evening all round!More</p>
<p>First, I would never have found this place if I wasn't with family who live in the area! So glad we made it here. The set up with all the succulents and the waterfront was amazing! There was live music in the afternoon.  The owner...came to the tables to make sure everything was good and took pictures of our group. And the food and drinks were wonderful and very reasonably priced. Can't wait to come back to San Francisco,  will be one of my first stops!More</p>
<p>What an amazing experience we had at Mersea. I’m so glad we listened to a friend’s reco to check it out. Such a unique setting and experience. And the best part…the food was outstanding. We decided on lunch since that fit best with our travel...schedule, and it was perfect. We were making our way from Napa down to San Diego and this was the best dining we had throughout a mix of upscale and casual experiences. Amazing views of the harbor. Beautiful location. And the food was so amazing we just kept ordering. Paired our lunch with a wonderful bottle of rose. If you are in the San Fran area it’s a “must try”.  Don’t let the no-reservations stop you.  Lunch was a great California casual option. Live music outside and an afternoon view of the full harbor. Staff was all smiles, attentive and incredibly knowledgeable about their rose!More</p>
<p>A hidden gem! Enjoyed delicious food, drink and a snickerdoodle cookie, while looking out at beautiful skyline of SF!!</p>
<p>Mersea is a hidden gem on Treasure Island in SF. Great views of the SF Bay and SF skyline. Great food, great drinks! Meesun on of the owners was so pleasant and welcoming!! Mersea is a must see if you want to relax and enjoy</p>
<p>Mersea is my top pick! Spent a wonderful 9 days traveling the southern Ca coast and had fabulous meals. My biggest surprise and very best experience was Mersea where the food and drink were unparalleled, the atmosphere great fun and the view extraordinary!</p>
<p>Love this place. I work down the street and come here all the time. They never miss!

Tourists,

If you are visiting the City, I highly recommend taking the ferry out to TI to take some photos with that iconic skyline. Have some drinks,</p>
<p>Food was very good.  I had the shrimp toast and my wife had the tacos.  All very tasty.  We also had the soft serve swirl ice cream and it was good, too.  Staff is friendly.  Great views.  Lots of construction nearby..we just beat a senior</p>
<p>Mersea restaurant on Treasure Island is an outstanding venue for hosting events and hanging out with friends. The exceptional customer service from the team and owner MeeSun sets them apart. They surpassed all expectations, paying meticulous attention to every detail. Our recent 5th-anniversary celebration for</p>
<p>My husband and I stumbled upon this Treasure Island gem two years ago and ever since we've remained huge fans. First off, the food is incredible, tasty and fresh, each and every time. With plenty of seating both inside and out, there are lots of</p>
<p>You can hardly beat the scenic location of this place. After dining it is nice to walk up to the nearby waterfront and take pictures of the city, the bridges, Alcatraz, etc. There are a limited amount of interior seats (open to the outdoors and</p>
<p>Thank you for your review and feedback. You're correct, we are more of a 'lunch destination' rather than 'brunch'. For your future visit, We offer several options for Vegetarians/Vegans. We offer: Tofu Tacos, Vegetarian Pizza, Caesar Salad - you can add tofu, Beyond Burger, and</p>
<p>Amazing views of the entire city. Great live jazz trio. We had tuna poke (fresh, well seasoned), a shrimp roll and gazpacho. All of which was excellent.</p>
<p>I loved Mersea and the entire experience. The staff was very helpful and engaging and the feed was delicious. We were pleasantly suprised by the weather on the island and blow away by the views of the city. The property has unique succulent structures, beautiful</p>
<p>AH-MAZING food, view,  staff and atmosphere.
A must if you’re in SF! 
Dog friendly, excellent bar, clean bathrooms and live music.</p>
<p>One of our group recommended Mersea for its unique setting and delicious food.  The setting and features alone are worth the trip to Treasure Island.  But the food is outstanding. The fish tacos were some of the best I have eaten.  The hamburger was upscale.</p>
<p>Outstanding food- kids loved the fish tacos and pizza.  Outstanding service- they also helped charge my phone.  Stunning views.  Will be Going back</p>
<p>Took my aunt who was in town visiting for the weekend for lunch. The food, drinks, and atmosphere was excellent. Loved the live music and the view was amazing! Be sure to order the fish chowder!!</p>
<p>The owners and staff are amazing! It is definitely food with a view🌁🌉.  Speaking of the food, it is so scrumptiously tasty...Try the fish tacos🌮🤤 The cocktails are very tasty as well. The bartenders will get you together…🍹🥃🍻</p>
<p>This spot has amazing views of SF and the East Bay! We walked along the waters path, then enjoyed awesome fish and chips, fish tacos and drinks. Perfect midweek lunch date with my girlfriends!</p>
<p>We cannot understand how it came to these massive over rated ratings. The restaurant has the Charme of a metro station. Just a little bit brighter which does not lead to a better rating. The food was ok. But just ok. The wine really bad....The service was not a service because it only was a kind of food transportation. 
I can only rate 2of5 and this only because of the ok-food.More</p>
<p>Small family friendly restaurant with the best meatballs and Gnocchi I have ever had in my life. The owner Luisa was at the restaurant when we visited and was a huge bonus. You must try- can’t go wrong here!!!!</p>
<p>The Burrata appetizer was excellent.  They make their own bread and the olive oil is delicious.  I had the seafood Toto Mare which was incredible.  Great sauce, tons of garlic and a perfectly cooked pasta.</p>
<p>We were greeted by Masimo who seemed to oversee our dining experience.  We ate outdoors which was in their semi-enclosed “patio” on the sidewalk.  It was fun!  I had the Caprese Salad which was outstanding, and the Spinach and Ricotta Ravioli.  The pasta tasted freshly...made and the Vodka sauce was delicious.  My husband ordered salmon and requested that it be prepared in accordance with his dietary restrictions.  It came out not prepared correctly, but Masimo quickly had his meal remade, and it was ultimately delicious.  We would definitely go back to Luisa’s.More</p>
<p>Visited here during our San Fran trip based on the high TripAdvisor rating. Unpretentious restaurant and prices fair.

Food was pretty good especially the Bruschetta starter, but not exceptional and maybe we  were hoping for something more based on its high rating. The restaurant was...relatively quiet with relatively little atmosphere.

Service was prompt and attentive.

Ended up having to book twice as for some reason the restaurant cancelled our original booking on Open Table.More</p>
<p>From the minute we got there we were made to feel well come. Nothing was too much trouble.
The food was fantastic. We all had a variety of food and it was 10/10. 
Would highly recommend 
Thank you</p>
<p>We visited Luisa's for dinner prior to a show at Bimbo's, just up the block. Luisa was sitting at the door making sure that the staff were attentive to the patrons as only an Italian matriarch can do.

Everything we had was great. This included...the house made garlic bread, the succulent carpaccio and Parma pizza. This was enough for two of us and we left quite happy.

We would definitely visit Luisa's again if in the area.More</p>
<p>We were visiting from the UK. Dined here on the reviews from Trip Advisor. Absolutely didn’t disappoint. The pasta was so fresh and my husband stated that his bruschetta was the very best he’d ever tasted. Excellent service, from this lovely restaurant. Highly recommend.</p>
<p>We went to this wonderful restaurant to celebrate my wife's birthday 🎂 and had the best night out of our holiday, and will certainly remember the night for a long time. We had a table at the curbside, and the food was a masterpiece of...Italian cuisine. Our waiter was very knowledgable and the perfect host. I will return the next time I am in San Francisco.More</p>
<p>Family friendly &amp; incredible food that is also affordable in comparison to other comparable restaurants. We didn’t realize her daughter’s restaurant was Paisanos in pacifica. When Luisa said it was her daughter we said…that makes complete sense! We had been going to Luisa’s and Paisanos...for years before we moved away from the Bay Area. It’s funny that we had no idea that they were family. Tonight We enjoyed the gnocchi (my husband said it is THE BEST), manicotti (so amazing with the vodka sauce), and vodka sauce spaghetti (7 year old daughter who is a very picky eater loved it) were amazing. To end, we had the tiramisu and lemon cake- incredible. The best tiramisu we’ve had yet. We also absolutely loved the woodwork Pinot noir with our dishes. You cannot miss this spot!More</p>
<p>Great spot for Italian in North Beach!  Lasagna and Gnocchi are fantastic.  Best Tiramisu I ever had</p>
<p>Great value for standard Italian fare in an unpretentious setting. Service was good and the food was above average (though not exceptional). The prices were very fair.</p>
<p>Luisa’s is a classic old Itilian restaurant in San Francisco. Located on the far end of California Street. Food and ambiance great. The proprietor sits on a chair making sure everything runs well!</p>
<p>The Eggplant Parmesan was excellent!!
They accommodated group of six and we all loved our food. The Pollo Piamontese, and Lasagna was also delicious.
A must try</p>
<p>Thank you Luisa for welcoming us to your amazing restaurant! The food is exceptional, best one we had in San Fran. The staff was wonderful and the dinner’s decor so personal and soulful.</p>
<p>Best calzone I've had in years, excellent service. Luisa and the staff are great and we wish her all the best.</p>
<p>I dined here with coworkers and we had a wonderful dining experience.  The  Pollo Piamomtese was divine.  We met the owner who was a gem of a lady.  Don’t hesitate to make a visit here because I am confident you will have a positive experience.</p>
<p>Great experience! Dinner was amazing. The buratta mozzarella, chicken and gnocchi were delicious! My favorite was the house wine with the beautiful face of Luisa herself on the label. We were enjoying desert when Luisa walked into the restaurant! What a treat to be able</p>
<p>The food was outstanding.  Service was excellent.  We have a simple bowl of pasta which was delicious.  Will definitely be back when San Francisco.</p>
<p>Luisa, herself, recommended the lasagna, cannaloni di carne...EXCELLENT! Wait staff speaking Italian made us tear up! A fantastic place everyone HAS TO experience! Wonderful meeting Luisa! Massimo consulting with Luisa in native Italian was a wonderful to be a part of! VISIT!!! An experience to</p>
<p>I was heading to Bimbo’s for a show. Stopped here since close to grab a glass of wine. Sat at a 3 seater bar, which had me front and center to the action. I watched an amazingly tight team execute with intent and heart each</p>
<p>Luisa's is a hidden gem that I found in Little Italy last year. Established in 1959, the menu consists of family recipes made by Luisa herself. Among our favorites are the homemade gnocchi and the cannelloni di carne. Both are absolutely delicious.

The staff is</p>
<p>OMG the food was amazing 👏.  Italian food is my #1 favorite. From my entry at the door I could smell the flavor and knew the food would be great.

The restaurant staff was hustling &amp; bustling to take orders, prepare, and serve.  I ordered</p>
<p>I found this place on TripAdvisor, I noticed it almost had 5 stars so I thought we would give it a try. We were not disappointed!!! I had the linguine and prawns! It was delicious!!! My daughter had spaghetti with meatballs! The meatballs and sauce</p>
<p>We had dinner at Luisa’s on Saturday, August 19. We were visiting San Francisco as the first part of our trip to wine country. We made a reservation and they were able to seat us a tad bit early. We all ordered different entrées and</p>
<p>Visiting SF from New York and Luisa’s was recommended by a local. They have the best chicken parmesan I’ve eaten in my life. Everything was phenomenal, the Luisa’s Sauvignon blanc was probably the best wine to bless my taste buds. We were so impressed, we</p>
<p>I can’t say enough about the wonderful meal our family had at Luisa’s!  Upon entering, the restaurant exactly what you would picture as a traditional family owned Italian restaurant. Quaint place. Maybe with a dozen tables and a bar. The service was attentive but not</p>
<p>What a great find. After a busy afternoon sightseeing we stumbled across this restaurant and boy we were glad we did. Our waiter was attentive and knowledgeable, recommending items from the menu. Would thoroughly recommend</p>
<p>Had a great family meal in Luisa's tonight - for starters we had Garlic Bread, Spinach Salad and Bruschetta - all were fantastic.  Main courses were 2 Pizzas, Gnocchi and Lasagna - again all were excellent.  
Would definitely go back again and would highly recommend.</p>
<p>The atmosphere at Luisa's is warm and inviting. The walls are adorned with old photos and paintings, and the tables are set with white linens and fresh flowers. The service is attentive and friendly, and the staff is happy to make recommendations.</p>
<p>We were lucky enough to find this lovely cosy French bistro and ate here twice during our 3 night visit to San Francisco.

Everything was perfect. Great atmosphere and impeccable service on both occasions. Food was delicious and came out quickly. Excellent wine list with...a very good Cote du Rhone on the first night. Very reasonably priced too.

Easily one of the very best restaurants we have visited and highly deserving of its high TripAdvisor rating.  A real gem.

Highly recommended.More</p>
<p>I've been hanging around The Castro in San Francisco off and on since 1982 (and lived there from 1985-1994) so I was absolutely sure I knew all there was to know, even with the changes that naturally occur over the years.  Last week I reconnected...with an old friend (since 1974) whom I hadn't seen in 29 years - thank heaven he knew more than I did, and he took me to this extraordinary place - still technically in The Castro, but up the hill and around the corner from all "the action" in an old Victorian building.  We were greeted personally with handshakes by the manager - and the evening blossomed from there. The manager and staff are French - and clearly the chef is.  The wine suggestions were spot on (and not something I would have chosen) to go with the food - and such food! We tasted a bit of everything, but I have to say that this was the best Coq au vin I've ever had  - yes, even in Paris - with the tender meat melting off the bone into a complex wine sauce. And in the French tradition, though the place was PACKED the entire time we were there, we had no sense of being rushed and had literally two hours to sit and catch up on the years we've missed seeing each other.  And to top it all off, the cost was extraordinarily reasonable for the food and location.  If you like French food this is the place to go - take the Market Street trolley from wherever you're staying downtown, get off at the end of the line and walk a block over and up the hill - it's worth it!More</p>
<p>This is our 2 time dining there. It is an outstanding spot. Excellent food. Everything we ordered was a wow!!
The service was excellent as well. Felt like we were dining in France!
Outstanding!!!!!</p>
<p>In a magical neighbourhood in San Francisco, this bistro is a unique experience of tastes, smells, and the looks of Paris.</p>
<p>We live in the neighborhood and this is always a special treat. Steak with Frites or Roasted Chicken on a cold foggy night.</p>
<p>We were delighted to rediscover this intimate French restaurant.  Wife and I made reservations through Open Table for a week night and were promptly seated.  The menu was not extensive but well chosen, real French fare including escargot, coq au vin, duck confit, etc. No...full bar, but a good wine list including excellent kier royale.  We were served with excellent French bread and butter without having to order it separately, which is the usual practice nowadays. Wife and I ordered their butter lettuce salad, which was very fresh, with excellent olive oil dressing with anchovies.  The escargot in potato cups and delicious green sauce was innovative and flavorful.  The coup de grace were the main courses – wife ordered the Chilean sea bass special, which was outstandingly flavorful and cooked just right, as was the rack of lamb I ordered, rare as I wanted, with an outstanding flavorful wine sauce.  The accompanying vegetables and potatoes were also tasty and we cleaned our rather sumptuous plates.  For dessert, we ordered the floating island, which we love but have not found on the menu in any other French restaurant so far.  The islands puff pastries floated in wonderful creamy sauce before vanishing into our appreciative mouths.  The service was attentive, friendly, and professional.  Overall, a wonderful authentic French bistro, which we intend to frequent.More</p>
<p>I really read reviews of restaurants in United States. We live in the San Francisco Bay area and I almost never read reviews from restaurants here.

I love this restaurant. I like the buzz food was excellent wait staff was on point. There’s nothing not...to like.

I have the shrimp raviolis as a starter. My wife had the escargot. Both fairly unusual and perfectly executed. Honestly, outstanding.

I have the coq au vin which was fine. I’m not sure I would get it again. My wife had the lamb which was over the top. She is a lamb connoisseur and thought it was one of the best preparation she’s had in many years. The potatoes were over the top too. Next time we’re going to split that dish. There will be a next time.

I highly recommend this restaurant.More</p>
<p>This place is a great! Very tasty, excellent service! Great atmosphere!
We came to celebrate our twins 25 birthday, and this is the place to celebrate!
Relatively small bistro, on a quiet street, full of French vibes, and outstanding food! Everything we ordered wS just...excellent.
It was our first time , but certainly not the last!More</p>
<p>Just incredible. The food is exquisite. I can’t wait to go back. Love the atmosphere too. Very comfortable. Lovely decor. Very French. Just go. You won’t be sorry.</p>
<p>Last saturday we had a wonderful and delicious dinner at this excelent Bistro. We highly recommend it.</p>
<p>We just spent the evening celebrating our anniversary at L’ardoise Bistro and had a lovely experience. It is a small neighborhood restaurant and a hidden gem that we have experience many times in the past and the service was just as impeccable as ever and...the food of the highest quality. I cant recommend this restaurant highly enough.More</p>
<p>We were disappointed with the food here.  We each had a fish entree, salmon and sea bass.  They were okay, but nothing special at all.</p>
<p>Wife and I made reservations through Open Table and were promptly seated.  They do not have a full bar – we began with kier royale which was excellent.  For appetizers, wife had their special tomato salad, which was excellent; I had their soup of the...day (mushroom) which was quite tasty, and the escargot, which had an interesting green sauce encased in fried potato cups – this was intriguing and delicious but I wished there were more escargots (I think there were 3 or 4).  The main courses were the most outstanding- rack of lamb for wife, and the duck confit for me.  They were perfectly cooked, and had wonderful flavor and sauce, though wife wished there was a bit more sauce on the lamb. We shared the floating island for dessert which was quite creamy and delicious.  The service was reasonably prompt and attentive, and the glass of red wine he recommended was excellent. Of note is that this is a rather small and intimate restaurant, and the gentlemen in the next table started a conversation with us which was welcome as they had very similar tastes as us concerning gourmet restaurants.  Overall a quite satisfactory dining experience.More</p>
<p>We have been coming to this restaurant for the last five years. On average twice a month for dinner. We always order the filet mignon. In general, we were happy with service and the meal. Unfortunatelly, last night (05/30/2020), we ordered two takeout filet mignons...and to our surprise when we arrived home and started to enjoy our dinner, we realized that we were given two pieces of sirloin steak disguised in the shape of filet mignon medallion. After the first bite, the taste and the texture confirmed it was not what we ordered. We felt cheated and thought this action could be construed as fraud. We contacted the restaurant right away. They provided a lame excuse, blaming Coronavirus and the difficulties of getting their meat supply. What was most insulting to us was that after five years of eating their filet mignon they thought we would not recognized it. The restaurant offered to fully reimburse us but never offered an apology neither recoignized that they may have made an error along the way. I would not recommmend to order filet mignon from this place.More</p>
<p>had been meaning to try this place out and finally achieved that.
just a shame that I did not make it there sooner.
nice buzzy atmosphere, efficient if somewhat aloof service, and really interesting flavours in the food.

Wines by the glass perfectly acceptable and...good value.

from now, my go-to for French everyday dining.More</p>
<p>A nice experience for a late dinner on Saturday night. It is pricey though probably in line with similar restaurants in the area. While the steak was not necessarily of a very noble cut, the lobster ravioli were to die for.</p>
<p>I recently visited this restaurant based on the reviews. It was fine but I wish I ate my meal elsewhere. 

The restaurant has a dated atmosphere which could use some refurbishing. 

The menu was French but they were missing boeuf bourguignon, a great fan favourite.</p>
<p>The menu offered very good selections.  The dinner  was wonderful and the service was very very good.  Intimate atmosphere of a Bistro is the charm for this restaurant.</p>
<p>I highly recommend this restaurant for dinner.  There were found of us and we all ordered something different along with three appetizers and dessert.  There were no complaints about anything.  It was all delicious.  Looking forward to returning the next time we’re in San Francisco.</p>
<p>We dined here do for the first time with visiting friends from SCAL. The favorite dishes were the duck confit, the salmon tartare and the crime brûlée. The butternut squash soup was tasty and the Brussels sprouts salad was good as well. The chicken dishes</p>
<p>I thought the combination of food and service was fantastic. Not fine dinning but perfect bistro cooking. Only down was not a full bar. It was packed on a Friday night so I'd recommend reservations. We had an appetizer and entree so we didn't have</p>
<p>The extremely welcoming and efficient staff is very French.  Excellent but limited menu will meet most diners expectations and then some. Shrimp ravioli and duck confit are perennial best sellers for good reason.  Over five years street parking has always been available within two blocks.</p>
<p>Service was friendly, genuine, attentive, and always present without being intrusive.  The food was varied, but each dish in its own way magnificent.  Simple Coq au vin attained a level of perfection that I haven't tasted before.  Scallops were tender and complemented by a delicate</p>
<p>You want French food in a neighborhood place - this is it.  Made reservation (kind of necessary) and were seated promptly.  Glass of Champagne and then went thru the specials with the very attentive staff.  Started with a brussel sprout salad - loved it.
We</p>
<p>We came here with close friends based on all the great reviews.  It is really that good!  Charming, small neighborhood gem. We shared the charcuterie plate, butter lettuce salad, and the evening special, quail/arugula salad. All were outstanding. Two of us had the Mary’s chicken</p>
<p>During our trip to USA this was our best experience. It started with a very welcoming meeting at the entrance even if  we had not made any reservation. The day's recommendation was a starter made on lobster and it was amazing. As main course we</p>
<p>This place is a hidden gem in the neighborhood.   For just a few bucks more than other restaurants you get an authentic French dining experience.   The food is fantastic, as is the atmosphere.   The restaurant itself is nestled in a quiet neighborhood on Noe street</p>
<p>L'Ardoise (chalkboard in French) is on a quiet street, a few blocks away from the heart of the castro.  

The food is classic French food- cooked classically without any gimmicks or twists. Coq au Vin, Cassoulet, Onion soup -all are cooked perfectly. The service was</p>
<p>L’Ardoise was a terrific discovery in the Castro (SE corner of Noe and Henry). We asked for an early seating and were delighted to have a table for two near the front soon after the bistro opened. Very attentive service without being rushed or feeling</p>
<p>excellent French dinner, I went with my spouse to celebrate his birthday. Was our first time so we did not really knew what to expect and the food was great, prices are affordable and desserts were really good! not pretentious at all..</p>
<p>The table was ready right when we arrived on a busy Saturday night. It was booked through Open Table at 8:45. My partner and I had the garlic &amp; parmasian focaccia OMG a must have! &amp; warm olives (very salty) to start, followed by the...American Wagyu Carpoccio &amp; Tomato Braised Polpette (2 very large meatballs, could have stopped hear bc it was filling). My partner had the Orecchiette which is Genovese basil pesto, garlic, cherry tomato, Borlotti beans &amp; breadcrumbs. I had the Triangoli
Which is honey nut squash, mascarpone cheese, chive burro fuso and pomegranet seeds THE STAR of the night.  We have been to Italy and tge food was just as good.More</p>
<p>What a cucina ITALIANA!

Absolutely perfect pasta with truffles and chop , light and gentle like a feather !
Absolutely fantastic evening with great food ! Thank You and all the best !
Pawel</p>
<p>An amazing dinner. Some of the best pasta I’ve ever had. Wonderful olive oil cake for dessert. If I could give it 4.9 stars I would, just because they sent the food out really quickly and seemed to be in a hurry to get us...out of there. But it was no setback to our meal. Highly recommend, just wanted to add that the service was too quick for the staff who may read this.More</p>
<p>Arriving was simple for a couple of cable car novice Antipodeans (Australians).  As per concierge's explicit directions we jumped a cable car for the inbound journey.  As per my partners implicit guidance the outbound journey rolling through the hills of Frisco led us to a...cheap gin joint by the Bay.  Eventually located our lodgings in the early hours with guidance from a gentleman bearing a remarkable resemblance to Jack Kerouac who was heavily ensconced at the aforementioned speak easy.  Luckily I took some notes during our dining experience to refresh our taste buds.  A lovely wagyu carpaccio was washed down with a bone dry rose brut.  Pappadelle and lamb, benissimo with a inky barolo.  Bay fish over risotto was moist and delicious.  I would recommend a comfortable pair of shoes if attempting to navigate back to your hotel by foot.More</p>
<p>This was the busiest restaurant in the area and we now know why. I started with the American Wagyu Carpaccio that was very good and well seasoned. My husband had the Little gem salad that was very good but heavy on the cheese. 
I had...the Squid Ink Pasta special with Dungeness crab, which was divine! I would highly recommend this dish if available again. My husband had the Wagyu flat iron steak that he enjoyed. The lovely fresh asparagus and fingerling potato garnish were delicious also. The Vanilla Panna Cotta and the Chocolate Budino were also delicious desserts. I would definitely return next time we are in San Francisco.More</p>
<p>The bar features a cozy and intimate atmosphere with dim lighting and comfortable seating. The drink menu is extensive and includes classic cocktails as well as unique creations. The bartenders are skilled and knowledgeable, providing excellent service and recommendations. The bar also offers a small...selection of bar bites, including charcuterie and cheese boards. Overall, House of Nomad Bar is a great spot for a date night or a night out with friends.More</p>
<p>We had last dined at Seven Hills pre-pandemic, and hoped it was as good. The restaurant was even better, more creative, with incredible dishes. The artichokes and stracciatella incorporated unexpected flavors, innovative and perfect. Fresh and tender tagliatelle with lamb sausage was enveloped in pecorino....Most memorable was the fusilli infused with walnut pesto and entwined with heirloom brocolli and fresh herb sprigs. Focaccia bread pudding swimming in creme anglais, sublime. Service was welcoming, as was the ambiance.More</p>
<p>The ambience is very nice and the food is heavenly. The carpaccio for an app was delicious. We then had the Amatriciana pasta and the Papardelle. This were just out of this world. We shared both so they brought them in sequence. Portions are not...huge so you can taste a little of everything. We ended dinner with the chocolate buoudini… just amazing. This was one of the best dinner experiences in a long time. Will come back!More</p>
<p>Came here based on high TA reviews and ranking and we weren't disappointed!  The food was outstanding and our server Alex was attentive (only negative was he disappeared near the end but that is ok we were having a good time and he might have...been taking a break).  We got Prosciutto salad, Orechetti and Pappardelle and we werent disappointed. Highly recommend and be sure to make reservations as this is popular spot.More</p>
<p>Stumbled on what I would call a real find. The most amazing food that it  deserves more than one Michelin star. We do not eat this excellent food in London because we cannot afford it. This Seven Hills restaurant on the way to Fisherman's Wharf...is better than any Michelin star restaurant anywhere and we can afford it to eat regularly without any problem. Thank you Alexis for giving us such an excellent meal and excellent truly genuine service. I promise we will be back for more before we leave San Francisco.

<p>We had an excellent experience at this restaurant. The manager, Abraham, is simply outstanding and needs to be specifically recognized.

The meal was excellent. We shared the carpaccio which was fairly petite but outstanding. The flavors were unusual, not typical, and superb. There after, we...shared the meatballs which were absolutely non-typical. They had a little bit of cheese inside and the accompanying tomato sauce was perfectly on point. Finally, we shared the functional equivalent of spinach ravioli. Another excellent dish.  

Our server was excellent.

Parking at this restaurant is a serious problem. That said, it should not dissuade one from patronizing the establishment.

I highly recommend this restaurant.More</p>
<p>Cute neighborhood restaurant with excellent homemade pastas and outstanding service.  The truffle tortellini was out of this world.  Focaccia bread was fresh and the burratta was nicely done.  Plates are small but taste is big!</p>
<p>Seven Hills was described by our hotel concierge as “charming” &amp; that was a perfect adjective. It was a great experience from our warm welcome by the matre d to the end of our meal. We were seated in the back room, which was a...bit quieter &amp; more intimate. The food &amp; wine were good…we highly recommend the buffalo mozzarella with grilled peaches appetizer. But the best thing was our server, Kim T…her descriptions of the dishes were clear &amp; articulate…she was on top of any need we had but never hovered.More</p>
<p>3 of us went, all had pasta, all excellent.  My daughter wasn’t too keen on her pesto pasta (more to do with the bland taste buds of an 11 year old than the food quality) but they comped it and brought a tomato pasta she...loved on the house.  Excellent food and the same for customer service.  Would defiantly come again.More</p>
<p>We were very excited about Seven Hills after reading many reviews and news articles and it did not disappoint. First our service was impeccable and our waitress happened to be from our town. The wine pairing suggestions were spot on. The black truffle tortellini was...one of the best pasta dishes we have ever had, including Italy. If you love Italian this a must do in SFMore</p>
<p>Our party of four had a wonderful evening at Seven Hills in early June.  The food was creatively prepared and was delicious -  truly one of the best pasta dishes I have ever eaten  (Tagliatelli Verde). .  Our waitress Kimthi was the consummate professional, serving</p>
<p>Food was outstanding- 5 stars.  The service was a little lacking but our server was great when she had time to stop by. A wonderful place that I highly recommend.More</p>

Lovely review, thank you. Sorry service was a little off, we really do our best to stagger seating times for our service staff, I'm sorry this wasn't the case when you joined us. I am so glad you enjoyed all the other aspects</p>

<p>Had several appetizers, crudo was tasteless,  wine selection is pathetic.  Waitress pressed us to order everything at once which i hate. I had the pork chop which was bland.  Wife had parpadelle which was just ok.   No ambiance.  Even the chocolate dessert was bland.  Go</p>

It was great, with lots of flavor in the sauce including a touch of smoked bacon.
The place is small, and there are not white tablecloths, but the food is really good.</p>

<p>This is one of the best local experiences I've had as a visitor!

The sunset accross the water setting over the city was amazing, the view from Gold Bar Distillery tasting room bar is a million dollar view(probably a few more)

You must start with...the tasting flight! Try all the top notch whiskey Gold Bar produces. The original and the rickhouse are a staple on my home bar.

Now the drinks.. They make a great cocktail for any cocktail enthusiast.

The Manhatten was the best my partner has ever had. I was a huge fan of the Red and Gold. 

The drinks don't only focus around whiskey either, they have options for everyone!!

You will not be disappointed with your decision to visit this spectacular place, I can't wait to go back!More</p>
<p>Thank you for the amazing review! So glad to hear the positive feedback on the cocktails, especially the Manhattan! We can't wait to have you back.</p>
<p>Beautiful space. Had a cocktail flight.  It was delicious. Highly recommend, thank you to the great bar staff!</p>
<p>Thanks for the review - your cocktail choice looks delicious!</p>
<p>I originally wanted to visit the Gold Bar Distillery because I enjoy their whiskey so much, and let me tell ya, their distillery on treasure Island is such a great space with the friendliest of staff. Not to mention, you won't get a better view...of the city than from this spot!

I went here with some friends, but this would be a perfect place for a date night or to bring family as well! I also highly recommend trying one of their specialized drinks, there's not a bad one in the bunch. 

Thanks Gold Bar, you guys are awesome!More</p>
<p>What a great review! Thank you for visiting us and we're glad you enjoyed our cocktails. See you on your next date night!</p>
<p>Had a great time hanging out w my friends. Loved the Gold Bar wall and the staff were super helpful and friendly.</p>
<p>Thanks for coming by. Special prize if you guess how many Gold Bars are on our wall!</p>
<p>Visiting Gold Bar Distillery was, without a doubt, the highlight of our trip to San Francisco.
The drinks were amazing, the service was incredible. The owner even spent time with us, and explained everything we could ever want to know about the city, Treasure Island,...and the Whiskey business.
I can’t wait to go back!!!
Oh, and the views of the city and the sunset were the best you can get anywhere.More</p>
<p>Thank you Anthony for adding the Gold Bar Distillery to your trip itinerary! Hope to have you back for another epic sunset next time you're in town.</p>

<p>Fantastic time, wonderful people, great drinks, timeless restaurant/bar, sunsets, San Fran City View</p>
<p>Thanks for joining us on your trip to San Francisco, Berry. Nothing better than getting out on the water and taking the ferry across to Treasure Island. Hope you have you back again!</p>
<p>Such a great spot to have top notch cocktails and views of San Francisco that can’t be beat. Highly recommend making the quick ferry trip over to Treasure Island.</p>
<p>Thanks for coming by, Trevor. Can't beat the $5 ferry ride over to our Distillery! Hope to see you again soon.</p>
<p>Amazing place! It’s a must on your trip to San Francisco!! I also took a cab to and from without an issue.</p>
<p>Thanks for coming by!</p>
<p>Beautiful and unique bar. Cozy and luxurious atmosphere. I highly recommend the Manhattan. It was cloudy when we were there, but there would be an incredible view of the sunset over San Francisco on a clear evening.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by the Gold Bar Distillery. The Manhattan is definitely one of our favorites! Now you'll have to come back to experience one of the breathtaking sunsets!</p>
<p>Must see when in San Francisco, amazing view of the city, sunset over the golden gate. Fantastic drinks in this vintage bar/tasting room.</p>
<p>Thanks for coming by! It's hard to beat the view of the two iconic bridges, city skyline and Alcatraz. Hope to have you back soon!</p>

<p>Glad you got the experience a signature sunset from the Gold Bar Distillery. Thank you for coming by!</p>
<p>Showed up to the Gold Bar distillery in October.   The bar is on a venue on Treasure island just off of downtown with incredible views of the skyline.  Ferry or bridge access.  Gold bar is the official whisky of the 49ers.   Fantastic cocktails (the Manhattan!...) in a former Pan Am airport.   Service was amazing and the venue spectacular.  Gold themed.  Highly recommend!More</p>
<p>Thank you Rob. Glad you were able to make it on your trip to SF. Go Niners!</p>

<p>Thank you for your kind review! We hope to see you back at the Gold Bar Distillery so we can enjoy some more cocktails together!</p>
<p>We had a delightful tasting experience at Gold Bar Distillery. We enjoyed learning about the distillery, the craft of making whiskey and bourbon, aging and blending and so much more. What a wonderful addition to the developing Treasure Island community</p>
<p>Thank you for stopping by. We're so happy to be a part of the Treasure Island community and can't wait to watch it grow with more local businesses!</p>
<p>The Goldbar Distillery is a perfect place to combine a fabulous visit and view of San Francisco, history of Treasure Island, and delicious drinks and whiskey tasting
Light food is available and the  decor  of the bar very fun, take a bottle home with you</p>
<p>Thank you for the kind review! We love taking the 5 minute ferry ride over and glad you do too!</p>
<p>I got my medal in Treasure Island at Gold Bar. This distillery shares space with a museum. We all glowed as hundreds of golden bottles seemed to come alive. Bus 25 from Salesforce Transit Center and a boat from Ferry Building take under seven minutes.</p>
<p>Thank you for stopping by and visiting us, Anthony. We're glad you could visit the former Pan Am airport and Treasure Island Museum. We hope to have you back soon!</p>
<p>Treasure Island, with it's unique historical past and it's amazing location, is full of surprises waiting to be discovered...Gold Bar Distillery is one I literally stumbled into!!!

<p>The clam chowder here is literally one of my favorite things to eat in San Francisco! I’ve had Brian several times as a server and every time he’s top of the line. My favorite thing are his honest and fabulous recommendations for the restaurant AND...in the city. I’ll be back for sure and love bringing friends and family whenever I can!!More</p>

<p>I stayed at the adjacent Argonaut Hotel so the Blue Mermaid was convenient. But beyond the convenience, the food was amazing. I ate breakfast there most mornings and also one dinner. The food was cooked to request and the presentation was very nice!  The Argonaut...also offers guests a daily discount which made the meals very affordable. The atmosphere is very cool and Carrie’s over from the hotel.More</p>

<p>We loved Brian for his excellent service, kindness and his awesome recommendations and the discussion with him about the food. He was able to explain a lot of things to us about the preparation process.

We came in only a few minutes before the restaurant...was about to close but we didn't feel at all rushed but welcomed and had great and quick service! 

The food here WAS AMAZING!! we only had two dishes because we were disappointed by the clam chowder we had on Pier 39 (is it any wonder?), so the gentleman at the Left-Hand store told us that Blue Mermaid won an award and their New England Clam chowder doesn't have ham/bacon (we have a food restriction for pork).

The Clam Chowder was a 1000 times better than what we had at Pier 39 but the best discovery was Brian's recommendation of Shrimp Curry. It was unlike any curry we've had! Simply amazing!

We can't wait to come back again and hope to say hello to Brian as he is a food enthusiast just like us and seems to love what he does 10 STARS!More</p>

<p>Nice location but the food selection and quality is poor. I wanted to try the Manhattan chowder and asked if they could add shrimp. No. "Its pre made and we don't make additions." So I had the crab salad and added shrimp. It was ok...but the crab was a scoop and could have come from a can. A disappointment.More</p>

<p>This place is great.  We stopped here for breakfast one morning.  The food was delicious and the portions were large.  Our family group all had different things but every meal was excellent. 

The service was reasonably quick and very friendly. 

I’d happily return here.More</p>

I couldn't be happier to read your review knowing that everything that came out of our kitchen was enjoyed!  I appreciate you dining with us at the Blue Mermaid and I hope we can welcome you back for a meal in the near</p>

<p>We had a great experience at Blue Mermaid! Our waiter, Gerardo, was very nice and very attentive. The food was great, and Gerardo even brought us a sample of one of the soups, which was delicious. I loved the restaurant itself - the ambience, location.</p>

Thank you for the perfect marks and for choosing to dine with us at the Blue Mermaid.  I will be sure to share your kind words with our team and I hope we can welcome you back for another meal in the near</p>
<p>This restaurant was in our hotel. The service from Gerardo was superb, he was very attentive, answered all our questions, and was polite and prompt. The food was prepared the way I requested, and was delicious, I highly recommend this restaurant.More</p>

Thank you for the kind words and I am grateful for you dining and staying with us!  I will be sure to share your review with Gerardo and our culinary team as it always rewarding to know our guests had a great time</p>
<p>Very expensive… the food was ok 
Avocados were not good
They charge for refill coffee when you order a cappuccino !
Frittata wad excellent 
Cappuccino was gresg</p>
<p>Amazing food and staff. Fresh ingredients and home cooked feel. We stayed in hotel Zephyr and this place was just a few mins walk away.</p>
<p>Great cafe with options for breakfast and lunch.
Really close to fishermans wharf, although far enough away that it's not crowded with tourists.
The food tastes fresh which is great.
Indoor and outdoor seating available.
The only thing that didn't work for me was being...given the bill when I had finished my brunch but not my coffee and I had not asked for it either, feels like you are being rushed out.
The prices are high for just breakfast/brunch, although the food is very tasty so worth it.
They still have a very old fashioned way of billing, wasting paper, singing a bill, adding a tip manually instead of doing everything simply on one machineMore</p>
<p>The best breakfast ever! The fruit was so fresh and delicious. The service impeccable and very friendly staff. I have never been to a restaurant that is so attentive to the bathroom! Clean and very accommodating atmosphere</p>
<p>Excellent fast service and the food was delicious. Plenty of coffee refills as well. Would highly recommend when visiting the area.</p>
<p>The menu at Eight Am features a wide variety of dishes, including pancakes, waffles, eggs Benedict, and avocado toast. The food is made with fresh, high-quality ingredients and is cooked to perfection. The service is friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere is warm and inviting.</p>
<p>Excellent breakfast with friendly staff. We had a small wait but once seated service was fast. The bagel choice breakfast was scrumptious.</p>
<p>Really excellent efficient and friendly service. Food was very good and came quickly. Good range of food for adult and kids</p>
<p>This is a great place for breakfast near Fisherman's Wharf.  The food was delicious and prepared the way I ordered it.  Service was quick and everyone was friendly and helpful.</p>
<p>Be prepared for a short wait for a table (it’s very popular) but once you get seated the breakfast is delicious. I had the bacon and eggs, my wife had a granola, and our kids had crepes - none of us were disappointed.</p>
<p>$126 to feed 2 kids and 2 adults for breakfast! Ridiculous. It's a simple dive spot, nothing fancy and would be okay if it was half the price. 
All we ordered was a salmon bagle, chia pudding, french toast and a waffle. Two coffes and...a single juice for the kids. 
They also add a mandatory 20 % tip if there are 4 or more of you and while the service was okay, it certainly wasn't worth 20%.More</p>
<p>Great place, nice service, line is going fast. Chea seed pudding was great , everything is fresh, friendly staff</p>
<p>I was concerned when we firsts entered the cafe because staff was a bit abrupt but I was mistaken. They were so nice and took great care. Our food was something to write home about!</p>
<p>Visited here day 1 of our 5 day trip as conveniently just across from our hotel
Great team, very friendly, found us a table straight away as just 2 of us, que was forming outside for larger parties

Ordered French toast, fruit and bacon and...waffles with fruit and 2 coffees, came in abt $72
Thought a little pricey but as we went through the week we realised SF is quite expensive
Portion was also huge (we ate the lot!) So we didn't have lunch!

Definitely worth a visit for breakfastMore</p>
<p>Outstanding service and food. Three different frittatas and a berry waffle. Free flowing coffee. We chose to sit outside. Small location but worth the wait.</p>
<p>Wasn’t sure what to expect but fruit was exceptionally fresh and sweet. Bagels were better than imagined. Definitely worth the stop.</p>
<p>Visited here for the past 3 days, breakfasts are excellent, staff are super friendly, sometimes you need to wait for a table, but it’s worth it, would definitely recommend.</p>
<p>3 night stay in San Fran, and can honestly say this was the best breakfast we had. Myself and my partner came back twice because we enjoyed it that much. Very fresh food and friendly service. Matcha coffees are 10/10 and do not sleep on</p>
<p>Delicious!!! Everything was fresh and the service was excellent. We were a bit shocked at the prices, but after a day in the city, we realized they were in line with other places. Definitely would recommend.</p>
<p>What time is it?  It’s “eight am” in Fog City and time for breakfast!  😋

A quick scan of their menu is not recommended because you might miss what makes this place truly unique:  it’s their crepes!  

We sampled their “6AM Crepe” which features a</p>
<p>Very sweet people and just very good food. We stayed in a hotel nearby so we just could walk here and yes we went here all the three mornings while we stayed in San Francisco and it was totally worth it.
We have 2 small</p>
<p>Nice location, friendly staff, good food, fair price.
Be aware, back of restaurant not picturesque, eg near toilets and some stacked chairs but not a problem. Menu good but not that flexible re changing contents of plate. 
However, key point is great breakfast, eg refreshing</p>
<p>We stayed in San Francisco for a week, we tried a few places for breakfast, however eight am beat them all hands down! There is a wide choice of freshly prepared dishes and it is clear each has been prepared with care. The fruit bowls</p>
<p>A great find! Just opposite our hotel. You have to put your name on the list and we waited about 20 minutes. It was completely worth it. Great food, great staff. I can see why it’s rated so highly on Tripadvisor!</p>
<p>This cool resultant is located in a old house close to the hotels around fisherman’s warf. Only a 5 minute walk to the waters edge. The food was amazing and that’s all there really is to it.</p>
<p>What a place! We stayed in a hotel literally round the corner and came here for breakfast 3 out of the 4 days. Like the rest of the city found it really expensive - $60 for 2 including drinks but you don’t have to eat</p>
<p>We had great service and were seated pretty quickly after a short wait. The stools weren’t the most comfortable seating in the world, I prefer chairs with backs. But it really didn’t bother me too much!  The hazelnut latte was good (if I went back</p>

<p>Everything was wonderful. Great food. Lots of variety on the menu. Friendly service. Chai tea latte was great and not overly sweet.</p>
<p>The food and service were excellent. My family had some of the best breakfasts we have ever experienced. Amazing waffles, bacon, fruit and coffee! We were so lucky to stumble across this gem of a restaurant and will be back again in the near future!</p>
<p>Was walking towards Pier 39 from Chinatown when I saw some people entering Mo's &amp; followed in! 

People were friendly &amp; gave a nice welcome. It wasn't too busy when I arrived but it got busier with more arrivals as the morning progressed. 

I ordered...a spicy pork chop with eggs done sunny side up. All the egg dishes come with fried potatoes &amp; bread (toast or English muffins). Also got a coffee. 

A quick look round at what other people had ordered showed that it all looked amazing &amp; generous! 

It took a while for the food to arrive &amp; when it did, I could understand why - the pork chop was a thick &amp; massive hunk of meat, so it must have taken sometime to cook. The portion was huge! 

The fried potatoes were really good - nice &amp; crisp on the outside as it should be &amp; garnished with chives. 

The pork chop was well-seasoned &amp; tasty but it wasn't spicy &amp; there was a bit which was a tad undercooked. The eggs were perfect with the yolks still runny. 

The sourdough toast were a tad hard but otherwise not too bad with butter &amp; strawberry jam. There were free refills of coffee &amp; iced water. 

The vibe of the place was really nice &amp; cosy &amp; there were seats at the counter as well. It felt a bit like a modernised, more fashionable version of a traditional American diner, judging by the clientele. Although the place got busier, I never felt rushed to finish my food &amp; vacate the table for other patrons. 

Overall, I really liked Mo's. It was such a lucky find as I was in need of breakfast &amp; am glad I managed to try a fry-up in a diner. 

Defo recommend a visit when you're in town!More</p>
<p>Excellent service and food at reasonable prices. During a recent visit to San Francisco we had breakfast here three times</p>
<p>Great place to eat. Very good burgers. I loved the belly buster burger. Service is great too and prices a very fair regarding San Francisco.</p>
<p>Fantastic burger restaurant, this small restaurant in little Italy created the burgers on charcoal fire!!! And the Belly buster burger with garlic fries… was so delicious!!!highly recommended!!! Go there try and the prices are fair!</p>
<p>If you want a perfect burger, thats the right place.
You get a burger grilled on your request. They grill on an open fire! Friendly staff and reasonable prices makes this place worth a visit.</p>
<p>We had a fantastic breakfast here and there were many options to choose from. The French toast is a colossal affair and all of their egg breakfasts come with a generous portion of home fries potato and toast, so you won’t go hungry! The wait...staff are friendly and your coffee cup never runs dry - definitely a good and affordable breakfast option.More</p>
<p>We had in great breakfast with fresh ingredients. Large portions and great service, so we went there again for breakfast the next day. Great value for money.</p>
<p>One of my personal favorites for hamburgers.  The Burger is tasty, cooked on a rotating grill.  The portions are large - one order is two meals for us.  Wish they had a larger, better seating area.  They are located on the part of Grant which...- for my enjoyment - is the best three or four blocks in the City.  Lots of interesting shops to peruse.More</p>
<p>Really good meat and very good burgers. Service was efficient and fast. The carousel of meats at the entey is very entertaining. Just the French fries were way overcooked.</p>
<p>I came here for the good recensions about burgers.
Althought they are made fresh in front of you, they are nothing special.
The clam chowder was everything except a clam chowder,
When you see a 20 lt big white plastic buckle on the floor and...the cook taking spoons of Bolognese sauce to be reheated… you start to doubt of this is the wonder place people are talking about…
The attendant was also not particularly nice, but the cooks by the round grate over the fire where very alwnoledgingMore</p>
<p>We ordered takeout from Mo’s Grill after a long day, and ended up having one of the best burgers we’ve ever tasted. The chilli cheese fries were also delicious. Everything was packaged securely and well so that it stayed warm. We would definitely visit next...time we’re in San Francisco.More</p>
<p>Great find! Loved the burger! I got the bacon burger with blue cheese. Love the rotating grill. And great service too.</p>
<p>The burger was average and the fries weren’t that great. Either gnats or bugs flying around that I had to keep shooing away.</p>
<p>It can be fun to experiment with food when travelling, but sometimes a tasty meal is just what you need. Mo's is that. I had their roasted chicken special one night and the beef brisket another and they couldn't have been better. Cooked to perfection,...well-seasoned, and nice portions - not too big but not too small. The service is also very good. Looking forward to more Mo's meals when visiting San Francisco.More</p>
<p>Delicious eggs Florentine, omelette with fresh California tomatoes, a pancake that was perfect balance of sweet and bread. Good strong coffee. Reasonable big city prices.</p>
<p>We were craving a burger, and we got an amazing one from Mo’s! The portions are huge and great value for money. Service was very good also. I recommend the apple pie milkshake, so tasty!</p>
<p>The food was very good. BBQ short ribs for me, and a steak for my wife hit the spot along with the sides included. Service was attentive, no drama in the kitchen. What’s not to like? Finding the place. It’s about 3 blocks from any</p>
<p>The food here was delicious! The amount of food is great and the prices are affordable, the server’s were very kind and this place is overall amazing!!</p>
<p>Service was sporadic. Great at the beginning and then we were ignored when we needed attention for around 10 minutes. Good for an early dinner.</p>
<p>Not a fancy  place. But great food. Just like mamma used to cook. Come hungry, go home satisfied,  with money left in your pocket!</p>
<p>Mo's doesn't offer gourmet cuisine, but it delivers really good diner food. We went there for breakfast, based on a recommendation from staff at our hotel, and were happy with our meals. The restaurant, an old stand-by in North Beach, has just 10 tables and</p>
<p>We wanted a good burger and this place did not disappoint. The burgers are cooked on a rotating grill that you can see from your table. The place is a no frills diner but the food was delicious and the prices really reasonable. I had</p>

<p>Very good hamburgers and awesome breakfast! Nice service and big portions of food so go there and be hungry, especially for breakfast! Coffee not so good but the food is great!</p>
<p>Very good burgers, fresh ingredients, reasonable prices. Nice staff, quick service. Don´t expect anything fancy though. I wouldn´t go to this place for a couple´s night out.</p>
<p>We had high hopes but it wasn’t great here. The people were super friendly but the service was slow. It’s not a big place and it wasn’t busy but we didn’t get any refills on water and not once were we asked how our food</p>
<p>Mos is a small diner at North Beach that does burgers. You can get multiple versions ranging from the traditional BBQ burger through to an Alpine burger to a burger with different types cheese. The ingredients were freshly cooked and the meat in the patty</p>
<p>We had Sloppy Mo and a burguer, both of them delicious and the relation price/ quality was pretty good.  Great service too!</p>
<p>Very Good burger &amp; Fries!  Loved the grilled onions &amp; mushrooms.  The fries were excellent &amp; it was huge ... could hardly finish the 8 oz burger!</p>
<p>Small, "diner" style restaurant that specializes in burgers. There are maybe about 30 seats total in the restaurant, so it's tight. My husband and I sat at the counter and both ordered burgers and fries. The burger was huuuuge and cooked how we liked. There</p>
<p>We dined here for lunch. Really nice restaurant. Great menu. Awesome service. Greek dishes. Wood fired ovens. Highly recommended.</p>
<p>Very good food in this high end Greek restaurant.
Staff is courteous and swift, the dining room is spacious and welcoming.
My lamb chops were excellent and I certainly could have eaten more than the two that were served.
Original dessert of ouzo flavored sorbet...with cucumbers was delicious.
Not cheap obviously.More</p>
<p>The best Greek restaurant in San Francisco. I was interested in the dishes and drinks on the menu. Your manager was very polite in giving me a piece of advice on the signature dishes, starters, and desserts. Time to call it a day, and my...final say is that you have a nice staff! thanksMore</p>
<p>We stopped in during a weekend girls trip and we’re looking for a quick late-night bite and glass of wine. We were pleasantly surprised to find an expansive yet warm and hospitable ambiance. The few plates we ordered were spot on! The flavors, the textures...and the portions met all of our expectations! Also, great selection on the wine list—we’re super excited to find a Diamantakos xinomavro on the list!More</p>
<p>I have always loved Kokkari.
Had dinner at the bar 10/7/23.
We like to dine at the bar for the interactive experience. 
The bar tender was cold, unattentive and borderline rude. For example: when we sat down he was making a drink that was beautiful...and interesting to me. When I asked him what it was he told me the name of it with an accent that I didn’t understand. When I asked him to explain it In English, he slammed the cocktail menu in front of me and pointed to the drink. The server was also a bit cold but warned up after chatting with him. 
Food was excellent, as it always has been. Though a bit soured due to the staff experience.More</p>
<p>Our Family decided to show up and dolled myself up at your restaurant. So, I was bewildered in choosing great restaurant for my husband's anniversary. Anyway, I had a pleasant  experience to phone your restaurant manager. I'm vibing with that fact that this is the...best Greek restaurant in San Francisco.

<p>Kokkari is a great Greek Restaurant 
We where two people and shared the Dolmas with duck and the Calamari with fennel as starters and the Lamb Chops cooked to perfection, medium rare
For dessert we had yogurt ice cream with strawberries granita and a chocolate...pistachio cone
The food was delicious and the place is very nice
Excellent serviceMore</p>
<p>Kenny and George very disappointed I’ve been coming to the place for decades now, and having a waiter, who barely speaks the basics and understands the basic of Greek cuisine, was disappointing, wine service, non-existent, charged for supposedly a complementary dessert wine, despite giving the...waiter, a taste of my $130 bottle of rare Greek wine 
absolutely unacceptable 
horrific experience. I’ll never return 
clean up the mess. It’s pathetic.More</p>
<p>Sophisticated greek cousine, wonderful balanced tastes and elaborated greek ingredients. Top in San Francisco</p>
<p>Very good greek restaurant, We ordered and order of stuffed grape leaf, octopus and a rack of lamb, all cooked very well, good taste and good presentation. Service very good, it is recommended</p>
<p>In love with this place I can see why it is so recommend, the food is simple and completely amazing. True to greek cousine, my fav</p>
<p>What a great meal! We were taken to this restaurant by a local friend of ours and her husband. The appetizers were delicious. The meatballs, the spanakopitas and the green peas were amazing. I had the lamb kebab for my main course anti was absolutely...perfectly prepared. Desert was incredible. The ambiance was perfect.
I can't wait to go back for more!More</p>
<p>This is a very impressive restaurant. It has a beautiful decor, the staff is very friendly and provides good service. We shared a spanakopita appetizer and we each had the Kokkari salad. We shared the galaktoboureko, with pistachio ice cream, delicious. Prices are high, but...it is worth it.More</p>
<p>Romantic restaurant with good service and excellent food.  There were several whole lambs spinning in the fireplace that looked awesome, we went with a sea beam anyway and completely enjoyed it.  A nice wine selection too.</p>
<p>Lovely lunch spot! The server and chef worked with my dietary restrictions and modified what I wanted! Service and staff were very friendly and food was delicious! I ordered the octopus app and the lamb entree. My dietary restrictions are allergies to gluten, dairy and...eggsMore</p>
<p>This restaurant is beautiful, the food is superb and the service was great!   The lamb chops were amazing and the baklava was the best I have ever tried!</p>
<p>The best restaurant in San Francisco. Mediterranean food in high class. Delicious appetisers, main courses to die for, and perfect dessert.
Service was above any expectations. The flavours are unique and make it a one-time experience.</p>
<p>This place one of our favorite in San Francisco area, the food had a perfect balance of texture and taste. The baklava wasn't as good as mine, but it wasn't bad. :) Everything was fresh and perfectly cooked. The service is courteous and professional. Great</p>
<p>Everything about this restaurant is superb - from the food to the solicitous service and the lovely room.  Every time that I stood up, the waiter was there to reseat me, and when we drank a few sips of wine, the waiter refilled our glasses.</p>
<p>My husband took me here for my birthday. First impression was the packed in seating situation. At first they tried to seat us at a communal bench table. This felt weird since we were there to enjoy each others company for my birthday (we were</p>

The Food Quality and Taste was awesome. 
Only little expensive.
Great ambiance.
Very lovely staff.
Overall worth the trip and money</p>
<p>If you like Greek food, you will love this Kokkari Estiatorio restaurant. We went to Kokkari on a whim and were lucky enough to get a table; the place was packed but someone cancelled, to our good fortune. The atmosphere is rustic and beautiful, the</p>
<p>Have been to Kokkari several times in the past few weeks for both lunch and dinner. It is always such a solid meal and a wonderful, warm experience. It's no wonder this place is an SF institution (and so hard to get a reservation at!).</p>
<p>The food here is fresh and delicious! The service is professional and knowledgeable. The menu is extensive and I wish I lived here to try more dishes! We went on a Sunday evening and it was very busy... make sure you have reservations. They seat</p>
<p>Visited after many recommendations and while the food was nice and our waiter was friendly enough, I honestly think they were in a rush to turn our table over and was very underwhelmed with the whole experience. We had 3 courses and were in and</p>
<p>Outstanding red beets with scordalia.  They were exquisite.

We also had the roasted lamb, which was plentiful and good.   We shared a plate between the two of us and could not quite finish it.  It was lovely but missing the extra that would make it</p>
<p>We booked via Open Table from UK for our 25th Wedding Anniversary. We love Greek food so wanted to try here. It did not disappoint.. from the moment you step through the doors the service and ambiance is fantastic. Stephanie was our server and her</p>
<p>This please was good but not amazing. The service was so so and the food was ok. The portion sizes and quality of the food is ok, in all honesty it was a bit of a leatdown</p>
<p>We have eaten in many Greek restaurants around the country and this one definitely ranks up there with our favorite, Kellari in NYC.  The rustic but elegant atmosphere accompanies well crafted and prepared  food. Our dinner experience started with a warm greeting and being seated</p>
<p>Went to Kakkari with a friend with Greek origin. Love the classic and elegant setting. The food and service is outstanding.. from appetiser, grilled octopus to lamb chop.. everything just simple perfect. Will definitely come back!</p>
<p>We visited this restaurant for a late lunch on the 14th of May 2023. It was very crowded since it was the weekend and a Sunday at that. The waiting period was about half an hour but because of the crowd we got to sit...on the pier opposite the restaurant. It was 14 degrees then in San Francisco that day .Their service was courteous and their sea food dishes were delicious. Their  prawns, lobster are worth trying.

<p>Thank you for your review, Dr. Javed Rasheed! I am pleased to hear that you enjoyed our seafood and service. I hope you come back to see us!</p>
<p>Had the mixed grill and was pleasantly surprised by how well everything was cooked.  It's not uncommon to see fish overcooked and dry, but this was not the case here.  Would consider this place slightly on the pricey side for what it is, but would...still recommend to others.More</p>

<p>Very busy. Had to be given a pager and told the wait could be 15 mins. In the end it was only 5 mins. we ordered the clam  chowder in a bread bowl and it did not disappoint. Very tasty even if a little difficult...to eat without getting messy fingers. (Caused by tearing the bread apart). Very quick friendly service. Shame I will probably never be back as along way from the UKMore</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing your review! I am pleased to hear that you enjoyed our Award Wining Clam Chowder in a Sourdough Bread Bowl and our service! I hope you will come back next time you are in the area.</p>
<p>The clam chowder alone is worth 5 stars! Very thick and delicious. Really nice place, great service and good food. Try it!</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing your five star review! I'm pleased to know you loved our service and food, especially the Clam Chowder, voted best on Fisherman's Wharf! Thank you for the recommendation! I hope you come back to see us.</p>
<p>My husband and I had dinner here based on the TripAdvisor reviews and it did not disappoint! The atmosphere is nice, you can see the boats coming in and even saw a seal sunbathing right out the window. Dinner was good. I had the shrimp...skewers and hubby had jambalaya. He substituted the noodles for rice with no problem. He said it was better than anything he had in New Orleans.More</p>

<p>Not the restaurant we had originally intended to custom, our visit to Pier Market was serendipitous! The blackened cod was absolutely exquisite and did not need the remoulade accompaniment. Camille was a wonderful hostess and took great care of us! Pier 39 is a San...Francisco "must", but you will definitely "miss the boat" if you don't dine at Pier Market!More</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your 5-star review! I'm so pleased you enjoyed dining with us! I will share this with Camille and the team and thank them for a job well done. I hope you come back to see us!</p>
<p>This restaurant is very busy. The food is great and service on point. It has a better vibe than the local Fog Harbour which is too loud and very crowded. The views of the harbour are nice. Watch out for local fees added to your...bill, not only the 5% Employee Health charge added to all restaurant bills before you the  tip. TIP: Book in advance.More</p>
<p>Thank you for your review, Steve! We love hearing from our guests. I'm pleased to hear you enjoyed our food, service, and views. I hope you come back to see us!</p>

<p>Nice restaurant with inside and outside seating options.
It's a seafood restaurant, although has other options on the menu.
My waitress Ana was very good, friendly and helpful.
Very popular due to the location of the restaurant, so quite crowded.

I was unable to leave...a tip for the waitress due to the old fashioned ways of managing card payments and not being able to add it to the total amount on the card machine. Its too much of a security risk to add it manually on a piece of paper after the card payment has been processed and approved without me adding my pin into a machine, hopefully they will update this way of working soon to help provide more tips for the staff.
They had already added the sales tax and an employee mandated 5% on to the bill.More</p>

<p>This was a great restaurant located conveniently on Pier 39. We visited during the evening but had no issue getting a table immediately. The server greeted us quickly and took our order. The food came quickly as well and was fresh. I ordered the crab...cakes dinner, my sister ordered salmon, and mom order the grilled shrimp. Everything tasted great and the portions were big. Plenty of food, and we definitely left full.More</p>

<p>We waited for a table for 20 mins (we had a group of 5 which is challenging to seat), and the view / food was so worth it. We got a table by the window in the back with the a view of the pier....Our servers were pleasant and the experience was good. The place is kid friendly and pretty crowded in the afternoon but the food came quick. The next day, we had 15 mins to grab lunch before a 90 min cruise. We were back at the take out window and had wolfed down our rolls with 5 mins to spare.More</p>

<p>This was the only restaurant we visited twice while staying in San Francisco principally because it offered the best value for money dining we experienced. 

The restaurant was popular with a nice atmosphere set back from some of the more commercial and variable quality restaurants...on the Wharf.

Good food choice and drinks menus. We went for Millionaire's Bacon Sampler and Dolsot Bibimbap which was enough for two people. 

Walk-Ins were accepted and staff were both attentive and polite. 

Great choice for mid-priced dining.More</p>
<p>That's very kind of you to say and thank you for your return visit and wonderful review! We're happy to know you enjoyed your meals, and we hope to see you back again someday in the future!</p>
<p>We arrived without a reservation around 7pm, were seated 5 min later, had our diner for 5 served 10-15 min later and we were surprised by the flawless attentive service and the wonderful flavours.
We will be back tomorrow!</p>
<p>I arrived with a large group just before around 5:45pm and we were seated right away by a welcoming staff. For starters, we had the crispy tofu salad and their Millionaire Bacon, which is one of the things they’re known for. Both were amazing!! The...greens were tossed in a sesame ginger dressing and served with avocado and pickled red onions. Now, let’s talk about the bacon. Simply put: plain perfection. Thick and crispy and it basically melted in my mouth. The appetizer brings two strips and is served on a bed of asparagus. 

The entree menu has something for everyone: Korean fried chicken, noodle and rice dishes, soups, tacos, etc. I opted for the bulgogi japchae and it did not disappoint. Lots of bulgogi and noodles, all served on a bed of rice. Outright perfect. Entree portions are large, so don’t fill up on appetizers!

By the time we left around 7:15pm, the restaurant was full. I suggest making a reservation if you plan on visiting at peak dinner time. Service overall was very good.More</p>
<p>Hi Carm. Thank you so much for this kind review. We are so pleased to hear you and your group enjoyed so many items and especially our bacon, and look forward to having you revisit us someday!</p>
<p>Excellent food. Every dish we ordered, including dessert, was outstanding. Even though they were very busy, service was flawless. Everyone working there was super nice and attentive.</p>
<p>Hi Elif. Thank you for your visit and wonderful review! We're happy to know you enjoyed your meal, and we hope to see you back again someday in the near future!</p>
<p>I so enjoy eating here when staying in SF.

Wonderful Galbi and wonderful barbecue.

Excellent pinot noir by the glass.

And wonderful house specials like the millionaire’s bacon.

Such a great reliable restaurant - shuts quite promptly though so don’t arrive too late !More</p>
<p>Hi. Thank you for your many visits and this very nice review. We are happy to see you enjoy our food, atmosphere, and service so much. Next time you come back, be sure you introduce yourself so we can thank you in person! We look</p>
<p>We ate here twice whilst in San Francisco. The breakfast was 10/10 the dinner not so much. 

Breakfast
Service great, food was so tasty and fresh - a refreshing take on old favourites! A little on the pricy side, but the portion size was large,...and everything was delicious. It's definitely worth a breakfast visit. 

Dinner
Went back for dinner a few nights later. The food was still good but not as good as the breakfast offering. The biggest issue was service, they bring your meal out SO fast, we had an appetiser to share and 2 mains with drinks but only stayed in the restaurant for 30 minutes. They need to slow things down and bit and let people enjoy a more leisurely dinner. I'd give dinner a miss in future.More</p>
<p>Hi Groovyjo. Thank you so much for this kind review. We look forward to having you visit us again!</p>
<p>Passed the restaurant a few times as was staying in the area. Went in and wasn’t disappointed. The fusion of Korean and Mexican works well. Had the nachos then the  Tacos with fried chicken. Recommended this to a potential diner outside on the way out...who duly walked straight in. Would definitely returnMore</p>
<p>Hi. We're happy you joined us and enjoyed your visit so much. We hope you'll be back again someday. Thank you!</p>
<p>Not impressed even though the ratings were good. Expensive. Everything that had meat in it was slightly sweet when it should have been savory except the fried rice which was too earthy. The nachos were odd. Fried chicken was plain and not sure what made...it Korean.More</p>
<p>Hi, we are happy to see you enjoyed your meal. Thank you. Please know our prices are based on using the highest-quality ingredients and paying our staff a livable wage. Even so, we are still competitive in cost with other top restaurants in the area.</p>
<p>Just a block or two from Fisheman's Wharf at San Francisco bay, this indoor outdoor Korean restaurant is extremely popular for the lunch bunch on weekends. There's plenty to choose from on a very entertaining menu ranging from spicy pork Bap to Kimchi fried rice...to the Korean fried chicken (seems to be the most popular).
The spices and taste combinations are totally unique from other asian dishes. The portions are PLENTIFUL and service quick and friendly. The Pimped UP Ramyun combines just about all the Korean textures, tastes and aroma. Delicious.
Very knowledgable servers.
Outdoors in the season affords an excellent view of the wild variety of individuals making their way to enjoy or work at the Wharf below.
Wine and  Beer.  
Prices extremely reasonable especially considering the portions.
Parking along the nearby streets or  garages.More</p>
<p>Hi. Thank you for your visit and lovely review. It's wonderful to know you enjoyed your meal so much. We hope you'll be back again soon!</p>

<p>Hi, we're happy to hear you enjoyed your meal so much. Thank you for your very kind words and we look forward to serving you again soon!</p>
<p>We decided pretty random to eat lunch at Surisan, and I am so happy about our decision!! We had locomoco and pimped up ramyun, and both were incredible, such a great combination of K-food and American food. I will say Surisan is so far my...favorite restaurant around the SF area, I will definitely come back very soon 😋More</p>
<p>Thank you for your visit and nice review, Trevor. We're pleased to know you enjoyed your meal and we look forward to serving you again soon!</p>
<p>This Korean serves wonderful food - beautiful beef Galbi and  incredible Korean fried chicken, all served with real IPA’s and stunning Sonoma Pinot Noir - first class service also.</p>
<p>Thank you for your visit and nice review. We're pleased to know you enjoyed your meal and we look forward to serving you again soon!</p>
<p>I was here a year ago and they were always packed, now pretty slow.  I have eaten there a couple of times this month.  Prices are up.  For example, including taxes and an add on fee for "employee benefits" an order of 12 chicken wings...is about 32 bucks.  Also, the quality is down.  Several of the wings I tried were good, but some were tough and gristly.  My wife spit out one wing and said it tasted "old." They are cutting back on portions of things like sides, pickles, etc.  And, When I got home one night with my to go order there were no napkins, utensils, or sauces, just the food. They have always been disorganized about seating customers, and can be difficult to communicate with.  For example, they have a sign posted outside the closed front door instructing customers to wait to be seated.  I waited, in the cold and dark, but nobody came, even though I could see through window that only 20 percent of seating was occupied.  This place is showing signs of imminent failure and needs to send in a manager who can fix things quick.  Customers are responding to being nickled-and-dimed and under-served by just not coming back.More</p>
<p>Tried the "Pimped ramyen" here since it both looks and sounds so fun! I love ramen anyway and it was certainly good.
The workers here are prompt and kind.
Very busy environment but has its charm.</p>
<p>We're happy to hear that, Princes. Thank you!</p>
<p>The food was good. The lychee-soju was great!!! The service was very quick. It was not very busy on a Sunday evening so our reservation was unnecessary.</p>
<p>Try to get here early or make reservations because this place is very popular. And I can see why. We came here for breakfast before they opened and there was already a line forming. For breakfast they have the usual American style breakfast but you</p>
<p>Nothing short of an incredible dining experience. All the dishes are reasonably priced, and everything we ordered was great. I highly recommend the dolsot bibimbap and the pumped up ramen.</p>

<p>Hi Markeric. Thank you for joining us. We're happy to know you enjoyed your meal. Please know we do pest control indoors, but as with all cities, we can't entirely control what happens outside the restaurant. We appreciate your feedback and will contact the city</p>
<p>Incredibly tasty food and great service. Needed to wait some time for a table but definitely worth it. Will come back next time we are in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Reservations for dinner after a harbor cruise down by the Pier.  Quiet from the outside, but a great vibe on the patio and inside!  The food was amazing and had a beautiful presentation.  Fast, friendly wait staff!!</p>
<p>If you want to get away from the "tourist trap" restaurants around fisherman's wharf give this place a try!
Food was absolutely delicious, and staff were very friendly.
We actually got there about 5.30pm and were worried it wasn't going to be good because it</p>
<p>Great place. First time we tried Korean food. Even though they were busy the waitress took the time to help us order and make thorough recommendations. Food was fantastic.</p>
<p>We were happy to find a restaurant across the street from our hotel with such good reviews. This was our first Korean meal, and everything was outstanding! Fresh ingredients, beautifully prepared dishes, and lovely staff. Our family of four loved every dish we chose!</p>
<p>Even now we are back in Singapore, with abundance of Korean food options.. we cannot stop missing this restaurant! The food is simply amazing! And just surprised, standard gratuity already added to bill.  Do i regret paying gratuity? Nope; the delicious food deserves every cent!</p>
<p>Surisan serves “modern Korean” cuisine, and we enjoyed our late lunch. I love KFC (Korean fried chicken) so we had to have that, and afterwards, we strolled through a new park in the city! Good value - delicious food (see photos).</p>
<p>Absolutely fantastic food. We ordered a K-Taco plate and six Korean wings, which was plenty for two. Service was a little slow, but they seemed to be short staffed on Independence Day which is fair enough!</p>
<p>Great little Korean restaurant near our hotel. Excellent bulgogi! Highly recommend this restaurant, especially if you want to get away from the noise and crowds at Pier 39. Short little walk from numerous hotels. Great staff, great good, fun vibe!</p>
<p>Thought it was excellent Korean choices . We had the shrimp sticks, Pimped up Ramyun , and Kimchi - all great. Prices are fair and choice of indoor / outdoor seating. Staff was very organized.</p>
<p>My wife and I enjoyed the food very much.  Bulgogi was excellent and they are also a great choice for breakfast as well.  If you are a bacon fan, I'd recommend the millionaire's bacon.</p>
<p>This is a pleasant neighborhood restaurant offering good but not great food.  I have eaten here many times and enjoyed it.

But the notion that this is the 10th best restaurant in San Francisco is completely absurd and an offense to the truly great restaurants...in town.  I suspect more than a little social media manipulation is going on to pump up the rating.More</p>
<p>This place is great! We came here a few years ago when visiting for a conference and we had a great meal overall. We tried some clam chowder, cioppino, and the crab cakes and they were all delicious. The seafood here is great and definitely...worth the wait if there's a line. We would definitely come back here again and it'll be on our itinerary every time we're visiting San Francisco!More</p>
<p>Great spot for an outdoor light lunch.  Fast and friendly service, delicious oysters on the half shell, homemade crab cakes and a large salad to share, a treat.</p>
<p>We were in SF to see our nephew and he brought us here and picked the food. He really made all the right choices. We shared crab cakes, clam chowder,cioppino, and toasted sourdough bread. I don’t know how the crab cakes stayed together, they were...all crab and crispy panko crust perfection. Clam chowder should all taste like this. The cioppino was a huge bowl of Dungeness, clams, mussels shrimp and the most amazing tomato sauce. The sauce had a nice anise/fennel flavor and a delightful consistency. We had so much fun in this tiny charming restaurant. It is apparent that every member of the staff cares about their product. Thank you for the best meal that I have had in a long time.More</p>
<p>Small place, waited 40 minutes for a table, no reserving ahead. We loved the crab cakes. We ordered the Anchor special for $60 with clams, prawns and oysters. It didn't all come together. Good wine.</p>
<p>I came as a walk in and was lucky enough to find a seat at the bar counter.

This place is wonderfully decorated and the staff took time to explain me their top sellers.

I was recommended the scallops as a starter and then had...the famous ciopino.

The fish couldve have been cooked more on point here and some of the mussels had a not so nice flavor but the broth and crustaceans were very flavorful and the broth was exquisite.

Nice freshly baked bread and aioli dip too and some good nappa valley wine.

Would definitely return, hands down the best scallops i have ever had.More</p>
<p>It took me years to try this place because the wait is always LONG. Now that I've eaten here, I understand why people wait so long. First, it is teeny-tiny. Thank goodness they've been able to add parklets to increase capacity slightly. When you arrive...(and I recommend you do so EARLY), you put your name on the list and then you wait, often more than 90 minutes. I suggest you cross the street to Swirl, buy a bottle of wine, and enjoy it at Swirl while you wait. 

Anchor also offers a $15 corkage fee, so you can bring in any bottle of your choice.

We started with crab cakes and oysters. I tend to avoid crab cakes outside of the Eastern Seaboard, but these were sublime: lightly crispy on the outside and full of real crab on the inside. The oysters were fantastic. I tried one of several types.  Most of the food is served in large plates, so it is shareable, as was the Caesar Salad. One serving was more than enough for the three of us.

We ordered the large Cioppino, and it was HUGE. In retrospect, the small, which is also huge, would have probably served all three of us, as we ended up taking some of the Cioppino home.  The Cioppino might be the best I've had in San Francisco, which is saying something since San Francisco is the birthplace of Cioppino, and many restaurants brag about theirs.

To accompany the Cioppino, I highly recommend the garlic bread, which perfectly soaks up the tomato base.

This was a birthday dinner, and it couldn't have been a better meal!More</p>
<p>AS A 20 YEAR MEMBER OF THE CASTRO COMMUNITY... I have had the pleasure of dinning with you to my hearts content.  Today was special, as  my partner finally agreed to meet me at your restaurant at 5 PM to wait in line for what...is normally your excellent service and hospitality.  My heart sinks as to my experience this evening.

We arrived at 5 PM together.  I had earlier been at the Hole in the Wall, where my bartender Matty and usually discus what you are serving on Sunday.  It seem that you are both of our favorite restaurant in the  Castro.  Only Matty is allow to call you in the Morning and reserve for pick-up or seating, (very hard to come by even pre-pandemic) and have his order ready at 7:30.  We discuss what is on the menu as I know you where serving red trout and when you sold that, to replace it with stuffed Sole.  Shirmp or Crab he did not know.

Upon my arrival I had head phones on, I wrote my name on your board and was waiting for a seat.  Three seats were open at the bar. Your manager, whom as I should by now know his name, greeted us and told us to take a seat at the bar.  I was more specific as there was a third individual dinning alone and wanted to make sure you could accommodate him to the best comfort of the three of us.  We took our seats that he identified to us.
You sent
I knew what was on the menu because I had discussed your menu with Matty and started to order.  I did not know what my partner wanted as an entree, let him order and then I order a dozen oysters, a Ceaser salad to spilt between us, and my entree.  Then I ordered a split of champagne, (for the oysters) and a split of chardonnay for the entree.  To which your maire d', the waiter who has always acknowledged our presence, offered us extra glasses of wine, if not bottles of the same wine we were dinning with on the house, refuse to serve us.  We did not confront him or cause a scene, but said I guess we will not be dinning with you tonight and left. No argument, no words, we gathered up our belonging and left.

The sad thing is that for twenty years we have always been a recongized customers.  Never over the thousands of dollars in tips and food created an issue in your restaurant.

It is funny, because while traveling through Uganda and Rowanda chasing the Mountian Gorillias, we ran into a couple from Houston.  In conversation with each other, we identified our favorite restaurant as yours.  Through the next six weeks we kept on running into the same couple in different locations in both countries.  Your restaurant made it easier for us to have a connection and say hello every time our paths crossed.
You sent
This is the memory I will keep.  Yes, you have the best restaurant in the Castro.  But restaurants in San Francisco, except yours, do not have a 60 minute waiting list at 6 PM and if they do, they take reservations.  Secondly, to have a cocktail while waiting to be seated seems to be encourage by staff to cross the street and go to the wine bar or given an estimate of the wait time, offered to have cocktails at the many other bars in your vicinity.

I am offended as is obvious by this note.  I don't think you will see it and it will be business as usual.  As a person of color in the Castro, this happens much to often.  Even by persons of color.

My name is Matthew Hudson and I have been a patron of yours for twenty years.  I have supported you by lunching when I can during the pandemic.

<p>三藩市食海鮮出名相信大家都知，而佢其中一個名菜就一定係Cioppino 意大利番茄海鮮湯，當年有好多意大利移民咗嚟三藩市做漁夫，如果某啲漁夫嗰日冇收穫，佢就會拎個煲，問其他漁夫將嗰日賣剩嘅海鮮俾佢，番到屋企加埋蕃茄同酒去煮湯俾屋企人做晚餐，絕對係充滿義氣同愛嘅故事！呢間Anchor Oyster Bar個Cioppino好足料同鮮味，啱哂點包食！佢其他生蠔同海鮮都好新鮮㗎！⁣

Cioppino is one of the staple foods in San Francisco. It was developed in the late 1800s by Italian migrant fishermen. The Cioppino in Anchor Oyster Bar was amazing and super flavourful. Of course, the oysters were very fresh as well!⁣</p>
<p>The Anchor Oyster Bar and Seafood Market is the real deal--genuinely fresh local seafood including oysters, crab, salmon, shrimp, and other seafood dishes served with homemade sourdough.

The fresh Dungeness crab was outstanding, served hot with drawn butter or garlic butter, or cold if you...like. Also started with an excellent Caesar salad.

The Ciappino also looked amazing.

The restaurant is small and cozy, with a counter and just a handful of tables, so you may have to wait, bit it's worth it.

Service is friendly and helpful and prices are fair for the quality of the seafood.

In the heart of the Castro on Castro Street.More</p>
<p>Small cozy place with great great atmosphere and delicious food (been in businesses "40 shucking years")

<p>Consistently great.  Old faithful.  Ive been coming here for years, and always a great meal.  Fresh fresh seafood, and while tiny and crowded, well worth the wait.  Wear your skinny clothes, as it gets tight in there!</p>
<p>Great little gem of a place. Seafood was some of best we have ever experienced. Small place with efficient and friendly service. This is a serious seafood diner, if you understand that going in, you will love it. If looking for white table cloth and...ambiance, do yourself and them a favor. We will return when back in town.More</p>
<p>Enjoyable dinner with colleagues. Sign your name on the outdoor whiteboard and wait for them to call you. We were there on a Monday night and had to wait less than 10 minutes. I had the scallop special and it was very good. Nice wine...selection - especially for such a small space. They have 3-4 tables and a bar seating area so I imagine waits can be long at times.More</p>
<p>We put our names on the list, it was only a short wait, mid week early evening,  we sat at the bar which was fine for us. We ordered crab cake starter to share and a couple of beers then the medium Cioppino to share</p>
<p>Trip Advisor and other rating websites have "Anchors" rated in the top 10 seafood restaurants in San Francisco, so my wife and I looked forward to dining there on a saturday evening. When we arrived, we were instructed to write our name on a board</p>
<p>I was looking for good seafood joint while in town and come across this place on Yelp. It is small restaurant in Castro area on the main street. It has only about 5 tables and a long bar to seat customer. They only have three</p>
<p>Great neighborhood restaurant. Delicious Cioppino (even the small is huge!) and oysters. Very busy and small with only a few tables. Recommend going at off-hours. Pricey (but what isn’t in San Francisco?) but worth it!</p>
<p>Oysters where amazing and the staff was very nice and friendly. Shrimps where huge and the oyster shots where very delicious. 

A very nice place to try fresh seafood.</p>
<p>Fresh seafood, cute atmosphere, friendly service. Ciopinno, clam chowder and oysters were delicious.</p>
<p>We had an excellent lunch at the Anchor Oyster Bar while vacationing in San Francisco.  I think we just stumbled on the restaurant, or perhaps we had read about it and then stumbled upon it.  Either way, glad we stumbled!

<p>My wife and I flew to Oakland California on Sunday June 23, 2019, for my Cousin 65th Birthday Celebration. We stayed in Oakland to celebrate our 47th Wedding Anniversary on June 24th.  I looked in TripAdvisor for a seafood restaurant worthy of celebrating our wedding</p>
<p>We were visiting some friends in Castro and they recommended Anchor as a great seafood spot for dinner.  The quality of seafood was superb.  Service was friendly and very efficient.  Oysters were delicious and fresh.  The STAR of the experience was the most outstanding Cioppino</p>
<p>This tiny gem is tucked away in the Castro district, a short walk from the theater.  The neighborhood almost defines San Francisco's inclusiveness and it seemed we had escaped a cross between New York and Disneyland to find real people living real lives.

<p>I was disappointed with the food. I'd read an article in the Chronicle and was looking forward since I love seafood. I ordered the combination seafood cocktail which was shredded crab , bay shrimp and one prawn. All except the prawn were tasteless. It was</p>
<p>Been in this place twice now, ordered Cioppino and it’s divine!!! Service is prompt and staff are friendly. Highly recommend this restaurant 👍</p>
<p>The food we tried in this restaurant was delicious, the special of the day was divine. The service coincided withe food and overall it was a great trip.</p>
<p>Oh my! Their cioppino is incredible. They really have the rich tomato broth down. Lots is great seafood in the stew.  The ”small” order was $49.00 but could really be split. You want to soak up all the broth with the great sourdough bread and</p>
<p>There is a reason they have been around since 1977--quality food!
One of the special's of the day .... was a beautifully prepared cod with panko crust served with a side of very tasty potato salad.  What a great lunch to keep me going for</p>
<p>Had Sunday brunch at SWEET MAPLE in San Francisco and the wait was only 15 minutes and we were happy to be seated outside. They use top-quality locally-sourced organic ingredients in their dishes and it's a popular brunch spot! There are a few other locations...in California.More</p>
<p>Hello! Thank you for taking the time to write a review of your visit and we hope to see you in the near future.</p>
<p>This place is great, so good in fact we came back on the last day of our US trip. The cocktails are really nice, try the spicy mango mimosa, and the food is brilliant. I had the French toast with millionaires bacon (which you must...try) my partner had the breakfast tacos both were fantastic. Service really very good too. RecommendMore</p>
<p>Well, just about everything we ate was outstanding. The Haas omelet was my favorite. The pancakes are delicious. The coffee is strong and tasty. Service couldn’t have been better. If there is a line… wait!</p>
<p>Very delicious little cafe!! The bacon! Omg! We ordered the millionaire’s bacon sampler, love love love! But it was $24 for 4 thick slices of bacon…$6 a slice of bacon, meh.  Maybe for 5 slices at $24. 
Food was absolutely delicious! 
You are charged a...benefit tax in addition to sales tax. A little off putting.More</p>
<p>Recommended by our tour bus operator and it did not disappoint. They are known for their flavored bacons and they are delish! Very attentive staff. Great food. Found a parking spot nearby which is unreal for the city.</p>
<p>This was our favorite meal of the trip.  The food was outstanding.  Loved the bacon, omelettes, and the fried rice ramen dish.  The also had gluten free toast.  The service was fantastic.  They were quick with drink refills.</p>
<p>The Oscar was rancid and sent back. Very disappointed. The pancakes really had that economy-hotel artificial-flavor fruit-loopsy taste. The wine glass (for brut) had the dirty dish smell which is intolerable. For $85 plus tax, not great. Did I mention how good the potatoes were?...They were good.More</p>
<p>We visited Sweet Maple on our first full day in SF.  Our friends who live in SF raved about their breakfast/brunch entrees and they were absolutely spot on!  The food was delicious.  I had the Farm Fresh Eggs breakfast and I must say that the...Millionaire's Bacon and awesome potato medley made it one of the best basic breakfasts I have ever had!  They have both indoor and outdoor seating and the staff is friendly and very attentive!  I highly recommend Sweet Maple SF!More</p>
<p>We ate breakfast here while we were visiting San Francisco.  We got here early so we were able to walk right in and get a table for 4.  June was our server and she was super. She did a great job of explaining some of...the highlights on the menu. It didn't take long for them to make our food and get it to our table. I got the regular breakfast with eggs, mixed potatoes, and the curry chicken sausage. My wife got the pancakes with bananas and walnuts with the mango chicken sausage.   The breakfast was good all the way around.  The Mango Chicken sausage was better than the curry chicken sausage to me.  The pancakes and potatoes were good too!    There are a couple of big screen tv's in the dining area and we were able to watch a tennis match during breakfast.  There was 1 young lady who came to pick up our plates after we finished eating and she was rude and unfriendly and rolled her eyes at us but other than that, this place was good.  I recommend that you try this place if you are ever in San Francisco.More</p>
<p>Great service, great atmosphere, lovely people! First stop in Sanfran fromVancouver. Highly recommend to all family and friends! Millionaires bacon absolutely delicious</p>
<p>Outstanding pancakes. Make sure you get yours with the bananas on top. The millionaires bacon is worth the hype. Note that this restaurant review is for the Palo Alto location. Wait staff was not very attentive thus the four-star review</p>
<p>We came here on Mother’s Day (not realising it was Mother’s Day as we are from the UK), so there was about a 30 minute wait to get a table here but I’m so glad we waited… it was worth it!! Their menu is overwhelmingly...big, they have so much great stuff. They’re such a busy place but I see why, as the food is delicious and so the staff are great too. We highly recommend the millionaires bacon, it was spectacular.More</p>
<p>We had some delicious breakfasts in San Francisco, but my boyfriend and I both agree that Sweet Maple was our favourite. We were running short on time, and were pleased that we were seated immediately even though they were very busy. I ordered a coffee...and the Mariner French toast with caramelized banana and walnut. It was delicious! The citrus in the batter added a brightness and acidity that made the whole dish feel  lighter. My boyfriend had the Marguerite omelette and said it was very tasty as well. We also tried Millionaire’s Bacon, and it did not disappoint! Thick cut bacon baked with brown sugar and spices, very delicious indeed! Atmosphere was nice, servers were friendly and attentive. A great experience at Sweet Maple! Definitely will return if I’m ever back in SF.More</p>
<p>Really clean place with plenty of room.
Went twice for practical reasons once midweek and once weekend.
Fairly quiet midweek and gets busy at the weekend and a queue this morning but big place so plenty of room.
Had pancakes and albeit thinner than other...places were really nice and I love refill coffee.
You pay extra for oatmilk so you know.
More expensive than other places but the food is good and cooked fresh. 
Staff attentiveMore</p>
<p>We were recommended by our son to visit this breakfast restaurant and was not disappointed. The service was first class and the food was outstanding. I had pancakes, eggs and millionaires bacon, and my wife had eggs and bacon. My daughter in law had French...toast and my son had poached egg and millionaires bacon. The quality of the food was first class.More</p>
<p>Amazing food, great quality and excellent service, Be prepare to wait for a table since the place is very popular and always busy. Also it is a bit on the expensive side but I think is because the food quality is amazing!</p>
<p>Great experience for breakfast. From great service to great looking food plates. The tater tots, the refill of coffee - what a delight</p>
<p>Stopped for breakfast after leaving Monterey. Enjoyed “The Big Hit” French Toast. The staff is incredible and the food was worth the stop.</p>
<p>Read a lot of reviews saying stick with the queues. We got lucky. Table straight away. But we went on a Thursday morning.

On to the food.

Whatever you do get the millionaires bacon. For a Brit I’ve not had anything like it. 

Also recommend</p>
<p>Get there early as this is a very popular place for breakfast. The millionaires bacon is awesome, and they have so many breakfast options. The deep fried French toast is just like my mom’s. Definitely worth a visit.</p>
<p>Let's start with the line.  I don't know how they do it, but even if the line outside waiting to get in appears long, trust that it moves FAST!  And, more importantly, it's worth the wait.  To keep you in suspense, I'm not even going</p>
<p>We were warned about the lineup on a cool Saturday.  By offering to sit outside we shortened the wait to 10 mins which wasn't bad at all, considering the meal.  The food was varied, hot and tasty, the service friendly and prompt.  We had the</p>
<p>Super long line at 10:30 Saturday. Waited for 30 mins for a table for 2.  The place was cramped. Staff was busy but all were polite.  Finally flagged down someone for coffee refills in our third attempt.  Blackstone Benedict was good.  The eggs were poached</p>
<p>The food and service was AMAZING. The Marnier French toast was flavorful and the portion size was just perfect for me. I would also definitely recommend the millionaire bacon with the pepper because I love spicy yum yum yummmmy!!!</p>
<p>Had to come to Sweet Maple to try the Millionaires Bacon. We came on a Saturday around 10 and had to wait for about 25-30 minutes. The staff really know what they're doing with the covid precautions. They had a stand for to electronically check</p>
<p>Hi Jen. Thank you for your 5-star rating! We're happy to know you enjoyed your visit and that you loved the Millionaire's Bacon! We hope to see you back again some day in the near future!</p>
<p>I walk by Sweet Maple every day when walking my dog and I really enjoy seeing everyone eating and talking in the outside seating.  I have wanted to try their millionaire's bacon that they advertise so ordered "to go" this morning.  I ordered original Eggs</p>
<p>Thank you for your visit, we really appreciate it! We're glad to hear you enjoyed the eggs and potatoes, but are sorry to hear if the thickness of the English muffin or the spice level of the Millionaire's Bacon were not what you had expected.</p>
<p>Loved the steak and eggs with fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. Also appreciated the all outdoor dining so I can eat out safely.</p>
<p>Second visit to Sweet Maple and we waited around 40 min to get seated. Omelette was delicious and portion was quite big.</p>
<p>We're happy to hear you enjoyed your brunch with us, Tina and thank you for your patience on any wait you had. We look forward to serving you again soon!</p>
<p>My wife had been early for an appointment and wanted to get something to eat.  We checked what was available in the area and we walked around to see what was within two blocks from us.  Nice crowds, but the menu did not appeal to</p>
<p>Hi Archie. We greatly appreciate you and your wife's visit and thank you for your very nice comments in this review. Hopefully you will be back in the area soon and will visit us again! Thank you.</p>
<p>Practical and flavorful. Nice installations and friendly service. Try one of the rice bowls with poached eggs.</p>
<p>We're happy to hear you enjoyed your visit, Tieres. Thank you!</p>
<p>This place was recommended as a wonderful spot to have morning Bloody Marys.  We sat on the patio with a view of the harbor.  It's at the beginning of Pier 39.  The drinks were delicious, and good service too.</p>
<p>Thank you for your review! I am pleased you enjoyed our service and Bloody Mary beverages. I hope you come back to see us!</p>

<p>The food was more like junk food than other breakfast cafes I have eaten at in the US. The food was not very tasty, it was ok, but it did not feel like it was made with much love and thought. We went there for...the view, but it was no views, at least not where we we seated. Felt like you average mean on an amusement park.More</p>

We had the French toast and the avocado toast.  One of our knives was dirty when we went to use it.  The avocado toast is...served with mashed guacamole vs slices of avocado and the egg we ordered over medium were not cooked properly.  However, French toast was excellent.More</p>

<p>everything is pretty good. the food is delicious, a little expensive, but worth it. the interior is interesting and beautiful. a little cramped. it can be seen that it is not always convenient for waiters to run between tables and not collide with each other....If we are in San Francisco again, we will definitely stop by. The staff is very nice, patient and friendly. some seem to be very interesting people.

<p>Horrendous service, average food. 

We arrived for lunch at about 1:30. Ordered and the food for the four of us arrived one at a time spread over 20 minutes. The server lazily kept leaning over people to get to other tables rather than walking around....No cutlery or napkins laid on the table. The server just dumped them all on the table for us to lay out. 
The food was so so. The server started clearing away the table and dropped the bill before we had even finished eating. 
Then he wasn’t impressed when he got no tip. Impertinent and Cheeky!
On the way out I told another server about how terrible the service was and how average the food was. She told us they were closing soon at 3pm. I mentioned that we would have understood had they told us this at the beginning. She at least apologised while cleaning away everything from the table.More</p>
