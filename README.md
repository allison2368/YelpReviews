# Yelp and TripAdvisor Reviews

# The .py files were used to scrape the TripAdvisor reviews, and the .ipynb was used to scrape the Yelp reviews. All of the files that were used to combine the data were placed in the processing folder. All of the .html files are the reviews that we scraped. The images folder has all of the figures we used in our project writeup. 

The primary objective of our project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Yelp and TripAdvisor’s dataset, focusing on the comparison of reviews from the top 20 recommended restaurants for Northern California and Southern California. We have two main questions to answer with this web scraping project:

Is the sentiment of reviews different between restaurants in Northern California and Southern California?
Is the sentiment of reviews different between restaurants reviewed with Yelp and TripAdvisor?

Our analysis consists of multiple elements, including sentiment analysis, location analysis, rating distributions, and identifying common words in reviews. To access our data, we web-scraped Yelp and TripAdvisor to extract the necessary information from each website, such as the restaurant names, URLs, ratings, and top restaurants. Then, we combined the data from each website to create an extensive dataset that represents the population of Yelp and TripAdvisor’s reviews. With the combined dataset, we worked to clean the data, fix formatting and different data type issues, and compose various visualizations to explore and conduct different types of analysis.
