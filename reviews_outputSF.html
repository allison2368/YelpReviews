<p>Went to Bottega for a date night and let me tell you it was amazing. Had a reservation so did not have to wait long, once seated the waiter attended to us right away and we were able to order. Food is amazing and so fresh! Drinks were good too. Highly recommend for a cute little date night.</p>
<p>Everything was great! Food, menu options, staff & vibe. It's nice to have a traditional Italian restaurant that isn't stuffy or way over priced</p>
<p>We had an amazing experience at Bottega! The food was delicious and the service was exceptional! We tried several dishes and none of them disappointed! I would highly recommend and I will definitely be returning!</p>
<p>Bottega surprisingly had dishes that seemed unique to other italian restaurants I've been to. The interior was pretty dark and they actually have these table lamps that they turn on for you, with just a bit of ambiance on the ceilings and walls. I got a seat with my two friends in the back corner so I didn't have too much incentive to look around. It was the day before Thanksgiving so maybe we got really lucky with the timing and managed to get a seat. By the time we were done, the restaurant was about to fill up.Their complimentary bread is very good. If I go to a restaurant and I enjoy their bread, it speaks volumes from my perspective. They have dried tomato in some of the pieces which adds a light kick. Olive oil on the side if thats your thing.I got the salmon fettuccine and it was pleasantly soft to bite into the salmon. Most of the time I get a salmon dish at italian restaurant, I often get displeased that the fish has been cooked too long. Then again, not my recipe. They add this sauce which they refer to as 'pink' and I'd say it makes the whole dish creamier. Not too bland, and not too overpowering. Really enjoyed it. I didn't try the other dishes but I didn't even recognize that my friend got ravioli so A+ for how their dishes stand out! The two tables next to me had my head turned every so often to look at the dish they ordered.I'd say if you are in the area and are craving some italian food, definitely try this spot out! I'd come again on a date for sure. The service here is excellent as well since they often come to check up on you.</p>
<p>Came here on a Friday night with 2 friends. We were able to be seated pretty quickly since we joined the Yelp waitlist ahead of time. As the night went on, there were definitely more and more people waiting to eat (we sat down around 7:30). I think everything that we had ordered was good! The pasta was al dente, the sauce was hearty and the pizza was crispy. However, there wasn't anything that stood out to me to be like "Yes, I want to come back!" Partially, I think it had to be the service. They kept rushing us and asking to take our plates away even though we hadn't finished yet. It was so odd! I'm sure it's because they wanted to hurry us up but also felt a bit rude. Like it makes sense if our plates were empty but we were clearly still eating.We sat outside because there were no more seats indoors, and it felt really nice. There were heaters to keep you warm. One surprise was that it was someone's birthday, and they had someone come out and play the birthday song with a trumpet which was so cute!</p>
<p>This place is a solid 4.5 with a perfect experience and good food! They don't take reservations, so it's usually just a wait, but luckily on a Sunday night, there was no wait. Sara was our waitress and was very nice, and she knew all about the food, joked around, and gave us good recommendations. The atmosphere is darker and intimate, but also very lively despite not having a wait, so it was definitely a place that people seem to enjoy! I have been here before, but did enjoy it the first time so wanted to try it out again (looks like I forgot to review this place the first time!)They gave complimentary bread as starters, and you could easily get lost finishing it while waiting for your food. Not sure how fresh the bread actually is, but it was buttered and warm. We ordered the Sacchetti and the Quattro Formaggi Roman pizza, and I was so surprised that this place actually split the pasta into two dishes for you to share! The Sacchetti is unlike anything I have tried before, and would say it is one of the dishes to try here to see what it's like. They are like tortellini/ravioli filled with cheese with hints of sweetness like pear, and then with some walnuts to add a sense of earthiness and crunch. It fills your mouth with all textures and flavors, and really does feel like a balanced pasta dish even though the ingredients are so simple! The Roman pizza was also very nice, a great amount of cheese but still with distinct flavors from the different cheeses they use. For dessert, we got the Tiramisu which I thought the cream was great, but just felt on the dryer side as it felt like the lady fingers could have been soaked more like you would have for a classic tiramisu. Last time I came here, I remember getting a pink sauce pasta, but that was on the tangy side and not something that I really remember, so I need to try it again next time I come to give a proper review of it. But the portion sizes were good and the service was great!Overall I think this is a solid modern Italian place in SF! I think the food and atmosphere is great to continue to visit again and again, and I don't think I'll find a dish like the Sacchetti anywhere else!</p>
<p>I loved this spot, the staff working were so accommodating and friendly. The space itself is super cute, even tho we had the option to eat inside we chose to sit outside bc they had ample heaters and it can be tight and a bit noisy inside. I ordered the Branzino and i can't recommend it enough, seasoned perfectly and cooked to perfection. Will def be back for pasta next time.</p>
<p>First night in the bay and pasta sounded like a great idea. This place was so lively and fun and turned our ordinary Thursday into Thirsty Thursday. We ordered various pasta dishes and appetizers and they were all a bit smaller in size than we would have preferred, but still delicious nonetheness. Our waiters were so lovely, accomodating, a genuine joy to be around. I would definitely come back and recommend this spot for a lively atmophere.</p>
<p>This is truly a beautiful restaurant with gorgeous pink hues and floral accents.The complimentary bread, a rare treat nowadays, was quite good. Our waiter made ordering our meals such a breeze by offering  insightful recommendations. I opted for the Mezzemaniche Boscaiola with pink sauce, it was so delicious! The staff's thoughtful gesture of singing Happy Birthday for my friend's birthday and presenting a complimentary panna cotta added a thoughtful and sweet touch to the overall experience.</p>
<p>I highly recommend a daytime visit to Bottega to immerse yourself in its enchanting interior, featuring captivating pink hues, wood finishes, rose gold accents, cascading flowers, and exposed brick--a perfect backdrop for dressing up and capturing beautiful moments.The food was yummy, and my friends enjoyed their meals too. I ordered garlic bread which was perfectly seasoned -- not too much, or too little. I also enjoyed my gnocchi with pesto sauce.  The pesto sauce was made into a perfectly creamy blend and not oily/greasy. Gnocchi can oftentimes be a rich and heavy dish, but they somehow made it light. The service was kind, and attentive. My water glass was always full. We were regularly offered refills of complimentary bread, and this bread was so soft, warm, and flavorful. It was a highlight on its own for me. Additionally, the wait staff surprised me with a happy birthday song, and panna cotta with a candle. Sooo thoughtful, and brought a smile to my face. Thank you!</p>
<p>No Fees</p>
<p>I mean... come on, if you walk pass this place, you are instantly sucked in by the open concept giving you a full view of their bar and alcohol selection with the aromas of delicious food being cooked and served. Bottega has always been recommended by my coworkers so I had an opportunity to take the family a few weeks back. Nicky, our server, was so welcoming by treating us like we were regulars. She made recommendations, told us the special of the day, and also took note of our daughter's food allergies. Kids were being basic yet again, ordering a pasta with butter and another one with meatballs. My wife and I shared calamari fritti, lasagna and they were kind enough to split the branzino for us. Food was fantastic with the branzino being the highlight of our dining experience. Fish was cooked to perfection, capers and potatoes were a nice touch, and everything was seasoned perfectly! I would come back just for this!Cocktails were tasty and beautiful... solid wine selection as well! Thank you Nicky for making us feel so welcomed!</p>
<p>Ordered to go on Yelp so unsure of ambiance. Delivered fast. I did the build your own pasta. I did the rigatoni with garlic, chicken, and pink pasta. The pasta was Al dente for sure. Barely taste the garlic: chicken was dry. Pink pasta sauce taste store bought like or like frozen food. The second one was the Ravioli, garlic, mushroom, onion, Italian sausage, and bolognese sauce. Ravioli is good. Didn't see any onions and i paid extra, barely 4 slices piece of mushroom and paid $2 extra, no garlic flavor,  but there was a lot of Italian sausage pieces. Sausage is bland. The sauce basically taste like spaghetti O ravioli sauce the one you can buy at Walmart. Most likely would never order from here again. Doesn't taste fresh, authentic, or has much flavor. Didn't come with utensils, so make sure to ask for it.</p>
<p>This is my favorite place to get pasta in the city or to order on DoorDash! It's so aesthetic, perfect for dinner out with the girlies or date night. Depending on when you come, there may or may not be a wait. There is an option to add yourself onto the Yelp waitlist remotely which is convenient. We always get wine to pair with our dinner. My two go-to pastas are the:*amatriciana: the spicy tomato sauce with the guanciale is so good; the perfect combination of spiciness with warm pasta*mezzemaniche boscaiola with pink sauce: the pink sauce is so creamy and flavorfulParking wise, it can be a little difficult to find street parking. There's also metered parking all around. It's overall a cute spot in the mission to try out!</p>
<p>good simple Italian fare with solid pastas and pizzas. no gimmicks needed, just the type of place you and a few friends would enjoy sunday dinner together family style.  Amatriciana was the standout here, no pancetta substitute here, guanciale all the way!Food: 8/10Value: 8/10Service: 7/10Vibe: 8/10</p>
<p>Delicious Italian off mission street! Their whole menu looked yummy so it was tough choosing. Went with the lasagna and wasn't disappointed. The first bite was so cheesy and scrumptious and brought a smile to my face. They also give you complimentary bread which was an awesome great. Love this place!</p>
<p>So yummy! Service was very considerate, and they brought out this huge black pepper grinder, which was fun. Cute date spot, though there were also families and friend groups there!</p>
<p>Came out for a much-needed date night and Bottega was the perfect spot to go to. First off, the decor is amazing. Florals everywhere and a cute neon pink sign, it meets the needs for both girl brunch and romantic date night. We chose a seat by the open window so we could enjoy the warm weather and people-watch during our meal. For the food, we started off with the burrata alla caprese which is essentially just a caprese salad but with burrata instead of mozzarella cheese. Very creamy and refreshing, a nice way to start off the meal. They also bring out complimentary house focaccia throughout the meal which is buttery, soft, and savory. For my main, I decided to get the gnocchi with the bolognese sauce while my husband opted for the sacchetti. My meal was definitely the heavier and filling of the two - they don't skimp on the portion of pasta and the meat sauce is rich on its own. While my husband's meal portion is probably not enough to fill up someone who is pretty hungry, the dish itself was fantastic. I'm normally not a fan of blue cheese, but the combo of blue cheese, pears, and walnuts was spot on. The dish comes in a white cream sauce which pairs very well with the other flavors on the plate. A must-try. Even when I'm full after my meal, I'm a sucker for whatever dessert item looks unique. Here, it was the limoncello mascarpone cake. I was a little worried it would be too much on the lemony side, but the lemon flavor was actually just the right amount. Mixed in with the fluffy cake and the creamy mascarpone, this was the absolute perfect, refreshing yet satisfying dessert to end our meal. Bottega is a must-try! Looking forward to our next visit.</p>
<p>The ambience here is so great for a date night or a night out with friends. I ordered the truffle ravioli with burrata salad. Let me just say the truffle ravioli had me coming back for more the following weekend. It's now one of my go to pastas. Also, need to mention that they serve complimentary homemade focaccia?! im obsessed. A must try if you're in SF!</p>
<p>I came here for dinner with a party of four around 7:30pm on a weekday and were able to get seated really quickly! I loved the decoration inside but it did feel noisy and was hard to hear my friends talk sometimes. We ordered an appetizer, two pastas, and a pizza to share which ended up being the perfect amount for all of us. Both pastas (mezzemaniche boscaiola and gnocchi) were good except the texture of the noodle was too firm for my preference. The flavors overall were great though! The bruschetta and margherita pizza were also fine but didn't really stand out to me compared to the pastas.</p>
<p>Their Friday and Saturday night hours extend to midnight now! Super lively energy even late at night (it's hard to find food spots open after 10pm in SF). Good vibes for parklet seating and indoor tables too Ordered the prosciutto burrata pizza in person for takeout, and it was really easy and only took 10 minutes for them to make! Came with red pepper and Parmesan on side.Pizza is a nice focaccia texture, more of a hefty bready bite flatbread but still soft/chewy. Burrata was so creamy. I thought there could have been more flavor outside of a saltiness, like a fruit, pesto, or pepper accompany the toppings.Would likely come back to try their pasta next time and get cocktails if with friends.</p>
<p>No Fees</p>
<p>My bestfriend and I went to this restaurant before a show and it was such a great choice! Our server Christine truly went above and beyond, making sure we ordered things we'd like and even remembered when we told her we had to leave at a certain time to catch our show. Wish we could've talked to the owners to let them know how amazing she was! She and the other staff made the experience so much more memorable. For apps we ordered beef and cheese empanadas and arugula salad. For mains we ordered the beet rigatoni and mushroom burger. We also ordered 3 diff cocktails, all very well made, but the 10/10 fave was the black noir. My friend who doesn't like sweet drinks was so in love w the black noir cocktail, so highly rec. Overall food was super good, but my fave dish was the beef empanadas!!The atmosphere of the restaurant was aesthetically pleasing and cute. I hope they end up getting full bar service, so FYI they only have soju based cocktails, and wine I believe. Which was great, but I do like more typical cocktails as well.</p>
<p>Lovely staff and service and the drinks were amazing but the food was just okay. I really want them to be successful but the flavors need some punch.The rigatoni was wild but pretty good. Steak was good not great. The chicken was pretty good. Beef tacos were our favorite app. Dessert we didn't order but the offerings seemed odd too.</p>
<p>We went here last night since we live a few blocks away.  Service was 5 stars, never had to ask for anything but some of the menu items need to be reworked - our food was mediocre at best and a bit overpriced for what we got.  Thai Curry Chicken was definitely missing something (it was very bland).  Noticed someone else gave the same review but wasn't even acknowledged by the Manager.  Wasn't a fan of the chickpea puree since it just made the already bland curry sauce even more bland.  Could have used more vegetables and flavor in the curry sauce as well.  Salmon was served with a block of beans which seemed like a strange choice instead of some seasonal vegetables or something with more flavor and color.  It was a brownish piece of salmon with brown pile of refried beans....Not sure we would go back here again.</p>
<p>Memento was a great spot to meet a friend for drinks and dinner. It has a cozy chic vibe, shareable plates, and amazing cocktails. The mussels are the best I've ever had with a decadent, creamy sauce made of Thai coconut milk, white wine, lime and curry. The Salmon Tartare was great with the avocado on the bottom and ponzo aioli plus the side of crispy, fried empanada chips. We also really liked the Crispy Skin Salmon which had great flavor and went so well with the side of fava bean purée. The coconut fudge pie was fine but a little chewy for me. I personally loved the cocktail menu as there were so many inventive, soju-based drinks. We ordered two of the sweeter, fruitier ones, the Berry Me and the Holiday on the Moon (topped with a cookie!) They were also low-ABV though they tasted so good that I definitely drank more than usual.</p>
<p>Cool new spot in Noe for an upscale dining experience.  Service was spectacular right from the time we got there and loved that they welcome everyone with a complimentary shot (tasty and not too strong).  For appetizers we ordered the flatbread, salmon tartare, beef and cheese empanadas, and zucchini fries (special for that day).  The salmon tartare was my favorite as it had a generous portions of salmon and avocado.  The flat bread kind of reminded me of a soggy microwave pizza and was my least favorite.   For mains we had the beet rigatoni and the curry chicken.  I appreciated the originality and presentation of the rigatoni, but it was somewhat light in flavor.  The curry chicken also felt like it was missing something. For desert we had the lime mouse and the flan.  Both were excellent and were devoured in minutes. Overall, they have good food and even better service.  We enjoyed our meal and would consider coming back.</p>
<p>Great food, engaging service, super cool ambiance. The owner was working behind the bar and provided fascinating conversation all night while serving up delicious food and wine with a Brazilian panache.</p>
<p>Good food, great drinks and very friendly staff. The kitchen was fairly slow but it was opening night so I would give them a pass while they sort things out Hello Brent, Thank you for dining with us on our opening night :)We appreciate your feedback and apologize that our kitchen was running a bit behind on our first night of business due to staff shortage. Since then, We've hired additional staff and feel that the food flow improved. We appreciate your support and hope we can turn this review into 5 stars during your next visit. Cheers!</p>
<p>Came with some friends on a Thursday night. We made a reservation ahead of time, which I would recommend because it's a small space. We were greeted with a shot of a specialty drink of theirs, which was very nice. We ordered a variety of appetizers- loved the Shishito peppers and the zucchini fries (off the menu). I ordered the salmon as my main and my boyfriend got the rigatoni. The salmon was solid, but if I could order only one thing again, I'd get the beet rigatoni- it was the perfect combination of flavors!</p>
<p>Such a lovely new addition to the neighborhood. We were seated at the bar and had a great time conversing with the owners and other patrons. Raf is an artist behind the bar and takes great care in his preparations, while Suhair is the life of the place! We had the Zucchini sticks and Salmon tartare for appetizers, the Crispy chicken was a main course followed by the Flan. Everything was delicious but the standouts for us were the Salmon tartare and the Flan. The drinks were also very well made and we will back here soon!</p>
<p>This is IT! The perfect neighborhood eatery. The food is delicious. Approachable but elevated. And you MUST save room for dessert...We were lucky enough to be invited to the soft opening. Now I can't wait to be here every Friday after work for snacks and cocktails!</p>
<p>Was looking for somewhere new to try with my partner and I stumbled upon this gem!Service was warm and friendly, ambience was very sleek, and overall we were more than satisfied with all the dishes we got.Even though I loved everything we ate, I'll forsure be thinking about the filet mignon and coconut fudge cake long after this meal! We most certainly will be back and are so excited to try the other dishes this restaurant has to offer! Definitely a restaurant worth checking out!</p>
<p>We were lucky enough to experience Memento SF opening week and it was very special. They have a great location with easy parking (which is not easy in the city).  I'll start off with the list of creative and delicious cocktails that they have are top notch, it was so difficult to decide which one to try first, my personal favorit Black Noir,  a smoky and unique drink , I wanted more. I had the Salmon Tartare and the Crispy curry chicken AMAZING and I was able to try more that were delicious. Overall it was an amazing experience, great restaurant , ambiance and service. Date night or dinner with friends this place is great.</p>
<p>My partner and I happened upon this restaurant by chance and I am so glad we did! Walking in we immediately remarked on the aesthetic and how it was our kind of spot. We had cocktails and a small bite at the bar, and both left a big impression! Every member of staff that we interacted with were so attentive and kind, and made us feel as if we were old friends. Absolutely looking forward to our next visit!</p>
<p>It's all about the details...We really enjoyed our first dining experience at Momento SF. The service from the second we approached the door to the moment we walked out was impeccable.  It really felt like fine dining service within a neighborhood spot. The comfy space felt both fresh and intimate.  I'm a fan of a smaller unique menu filled with thoughtful dishes over a fluffed menu that tries to please the masses.  The amuse-bouche-like beverage arriving shortly after sitting down was great to sip while perusing the menu. The food was beautifully presented and delicious. Momento SF is a  much needed addition to the Noe Valley neighborhood.  We look forward to supporting this new business in the very near future.</p>
<p>Dinner @memento.sf was fantastic. The menu is eclectic which means something for everyone. For a small-ish space, the ambiance is lovely. The waitstaff is kind and attentive. Great service. I'm excited to return. 1. You Had Me at Hello #cocktail2. Za'atar flatbread which has a perfect flavor3. Salmon #tartare was plate licking my good.4. Heirloom tomato and arugula salad with a generous portion of avocado 5. Shared Lime Mousse dessert with a raspberry compote that was light and refreshing.</p>
<p>Delicious! The food has a unique flavor that all blends together beautifully. The presentation is spectacular. The cocktails are super different and comes with a fun twist with the garnishing and design. A lot of fun, you want to try all of them. The decor is stunning and I like the soft lighting. The beef tacos to start and the rigatoni was yummy and I am excited to try more. A nice place for a date, a celebration or just because. So glad this special restaurant is in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Great food and ambiance. The staff is very attentive. The mignon was perfectly cooked and tasted amazing!</p>
<p>This was such a treat! I came here to celebrate my partner's birthday. Memento is somewhere where you can talk, eat, and enjoy the good ambiance. I was so immersed in conversation and the food that I didn't get a chance to snap a picture of the food or bar! :)The service was impeccable: they are extremely friendly and attentive here. I ordered the Portobello Mushroom Burger and it came with Truffle fries. The brioche bun was so tasty. And the fries were thin cut, delicious, and topped with a sprinkle of cheese. Would order again, because the burger was good but the fries blew my mind. What a great addition to Noe Valley.</p>
<p>Awesome cocktails. Highly recommended. Ok I have to write something else because of the stupid yelp rule.</p>
<p>A small but inviting space to enjoy fine dining, great service and personal attention from the owner. Happy Noe Valley has another good restaurant. Only complaint: no decaf coffee but they'll have it soon</p>
<p>This place has very good alfredo here and the customers they gave me was awesome, I will def give them a try if your out in the bay area. My wife thought I was exaggerating until I had to ring her ha</p>
<p>Came here on a Saturday night without a reservation. We waited for 40 minutes before we were seated. I'm normally not a huge fan of Italian but this is one of my favorite Italian spots in the bay.Not so - it was refreshing and the grapefruit really toned down the sweetness.Dungeness Crab Arancini - crispy on the outside. I loved how it was topped with pickled pepper radish and coated with scallion aioli. It was so good.Handkerchief - I'm always a fan of Bolognese so when I saw this white Bolognese, I knew I had to order it. It was so creamy but still felt light because the pasta was paper thin. I also loved how the pasta came out piping hot.Bucatini - the pistachio pesto got me to order this. The tomato based sauce was so light and tangy. The cheese on top added a little bit of creaminess. The pistachio pesto worked surprisingly well with the tomato sauce.</p>
<p>Leaving a four star review because I think Yelpbiased higher scores but let's be clear this place was average, especially for food.Just being upfront the food was overpriced and over salted. It's not that it was bad per se, but not worth what Pearl is charging. Nothing was bad but nothing was memorable at all.If you're coming here, stick around for the service and pleasant atmosphere. Those were highlights.</p>
<p>Want to have a great meal in a lovely place?  Try Pearl.   Being a single patron, I sat at the bar although I was given a choice to sit outside.  Both options seemed quite good.  And the staff was tip-top.Roasted cauliflower with sliced almonds, raisins and a black tahini hummus sauce was a great way to begin my meal.  The plate was well composed and the spicing was nuanced and subtle.Next up, seared scallops with spaetzle, corn and braised onions was a wonderful main course.  The crisp exterior of each large scallop encased an interior that was not overcooked.  And the sweet corn enlivened the entire plate.In and out and home to walk the dog while it was light.   And parking on Sunday evening was easy.</p>
<p>Pearl is my favorite restaurant in SF!I've tried a decent amount of their menu and everything is delicious! Starter, mains, dessert, drinks, everything!!! I try to stop by every few months to try their seasonal dishes.I had a work dinner here a few months back and my out of town colleagues all loved their meal here! Interior is very cute and service has always been great. They don't take reservations over 6 people so probably not the best for large groups, unless you're ok with splitting up the group into smaller tables.I love their cauliflower! I order it every time. For mains, all of their pastas are fantastic and I've loved every scallop seasonal dish I've had. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. My favorite cocktail is the tidy tips. Can't wait until my next visit!</p>
<p>One of my favorite restaurants in the city! I love that it's hidden in the Richmond. I've come twice now and both times, the food was amazing and service was exceptional.I love trying their pastas, but everything is delicious. You can't go wrong with any of it.</p>
<p>This is only my second time here, but it's become one of my favorite restaurants. I don't eat too much salad, but Pearl's Caesar is the exception. Their Caesar has a strong taste of anchovies, creating the perfect umami. If you're not a fan of anchovies, this salad may not sit will with you lol. It's lemony, cheesy, and the crispy prosciutto and croutons elevate the salad really well. I could eat this by myself if I tried, but of course I shared it with my boyfriend lol.Their steak tartare is the standard for me - whenever I order it elsewhere, it never compare to Pearl's. Beefy, lemony, and full of flavor. The texture pairs very well with the crisps they provide.The bavette steak was really good according to my boyfriend. He barely shared any with me and devoured it lol. I would love to order this next time if its on the menu.A few gripes..The Gemelli - first bite was delicious, full of flavor. I loved the spice and combination of the capers and sun dried tomatoes. The tuna was cooked well. The thing is - the more I ate, I soon came to realize how salty the dish was. I love salt and all things savory, but it became difficult to eat. I love olives, but their olives made the pasta even saltier considering the capers and spice. They really need to lighten their hand when seasoning this dish lol. I would have returned the dish had I not waited so long for it. This brings me to my next point..The wait - It was busy. I will not deny that. We were lucky enough to snag a reservation. Our Rez was at 730, and we came right on time and was seated immediately. We ordered maybe within the next 5 minutes. Our apps came out pretty fast, and I'd say we were done eating them by 810? The thing is, our entrees didn't come out until 840. Every single table around us had gotten their food before us, despite having came after us. The table to our left only ordered entrees - ok, that I understand. But the table seated directly behind us came a good 20 minutes after us, and also ordered apps, yet their entrees were also delivered before ours. The table to our right had completely finished eating before we even got our entrees. It was disappointing, as the service was subpar. I understand it's busy, but the waitress (Katie I believe) didn't pay us any mind and we had to flag her down to receive updates regarding our order. I'm willing to wait, so long as it doesn't feel like our order was forgotten lol. It felt like that. The waitress didn't seemed concerned that we were waiting that long. I honestly think she forgot to put our entrees in? Either that, or they need to work on their timing with the delivery of apps and entrees. I will surely be returning and will be supporting this business, but would recommended avoiding the dinner rush as much as possible. I'm sure it's much better when they open right at 5. Overall, this restaurant deserves their flowers despite the underwhelming service.</p>
<p>Ambiance: I booked an inside table for 8pm on a Sunday. It was charming and lively. Very nice for a date night. Service: Attentive and nice!Oysters: 4/5Solid - texture was smooth and the toppings complimented the oyster. Acme bread and butter: 4/5Solid, but nothing special - what I'd expect from complimentary bread and butter from the table, except this time it was a $4 chargeChicory Caesar: 5/5Amazing! I love the texture and taste of the crispy prosciutto with crisp mixed lettuce. The croutons were also great. Everything worked well together. Handkerchief: 4/5Solid pasta, and best pasta of the night. I haven't had a white bolognese before. It was light and easy to eat. If I were to make this at home, I would add maybe a touch of truffle oil to add more to the dish. Bucatini: 4/5Loved the stracciatellla with the pesto and basil. I thought the dish was okay at first, but it grew on me with each bite that I took. Buttermilk Panna Cotta: 5/5Silky panna cotta, absolutely lovely with the strawberries and the chocolate sable. Olive Oil Cake: 5/5This was my favorite out of the two desserts I tried. The texture of the cake was everything and more. The ice cream worked well with the cake too. If you were to choose between the cake and the panna cotta, choose the cake!Overall, solid food. I wouldn't go back for the pasta, but definitely for the desserts and caesar salad!</p>
<p>Food:The cauliflower was what I ordered and it was surprisingly delicious. The raisins balanced out the savory aspects and really made the dish stand out. Service:Perfect, we saw that everyone was very warm and friendly and attentive.Ambiance: It's lively but also romantic. This is good for friends or for a date.</p>
<p>The food at Pearl is delicious!  I've been twice and ordered different apps, mains and dessert, and both times I was delighted with each bite.  The staff are friendly and attentive, making customers feel at home.  The cocktail list is inventive and the bar tenders execute them well.</p>
<p>I took my husband to Pearl for his dinner and we had a wonderful time. The atmosphere was very welcoming, it was cozy, and we felt like we could relax. Our waitress was nice and gave us helpful recommendations. We ended up having the Kanpachi Crudo, the Hankerchief Pasta, and the Seared Scallops. All were very tasty and I would have again. My only slight disappointment was that I put that it was his birthday on the reservation, when I was texting to confirm the reservation, and the waitress when we sat down. Despite all of this, they didn't bring a candle with the chocolate cake we ordered. I know this is small, but it's a nice thing that restaurants do and it doesn't cost much - I was a little sad that it made it slightly less birthday festive.</p>
<p>First time back in over 4 years. Was surprised that the menu hasn't changed too much. Overall, still a solid meal especially the tartare and pastas.Halibut crudo: Fish was refreshing, but thought the peanuts and jalapeño overpowered some of the more subtle flavors.Chicory Caesar: enjoyed the garlic croutons and certainly a more hearty salad.Roasted cauliflower: Really enjoyed the charred smoky flavors and the black tahini hummus.Steak tartare: one of my favorite dishes of the night. Super savory without feeling too heavy.Mt. Lassen Trout: Fish had nice flavors, but was a bit over cooked IMO.Handkerchief: One of their signature dishes. Pasta had a great al dente texture. Would order again.Gemelli: Nice bounce to the pasta and enjoyed the freshness of the peas.Cocktails: Prices were pretty good for SF standards ($14)Birds Eye: Essentially an old fashioned. Wasn't necessarily too creativeCoastal scrub: Refreshing and citrus profile.</p>
<p>It was soooo good! Food is amazing! Definitely must visit place for amazing experience.</p>
<p>One of my favorite Mediterranean/Italian spots in SF, with consistently great service delicious plates, and creative cocktails. The menu changes with the regularly with only the freshest ingredients. I have yet to be disappointed.The space is causal, warm, cozy, spacious, and romantic all at once, along with a beautiful bar.They have an outdoor option, equipped with heating lamps.Plates this visit:-Wood oven gulf prawns - Fresh Gulf shrimp wood oven roasted to perfection in Diabla and served with Zhuhai crème fraiche.-Roasted cauliflower - Love the different textures and flavors in this dish, the smokiness of the cauliflower, smoothness of the of the black tahini hummus, and the crunch of the almonds-Seared scallops - So fresh and perfectly seared served with delicious butter beans, spinach ragout, maitake mushrooms and caper relish.-Spaghetti - Tossed with fresh Manila clams and delicious nasturtium, watercress and fermented Chile.-Radiatori  - Prepared al dente in a delicious lamb merguez sugo, finished with fresh sheep feta and lemon oil.Thank you Chef and and service team.See y'all next time.</p>
<p>My rating is a solid 4.5/5. The service was impeccable. I came with two toddlers and was seated immediately on a Friday afternoon. Our waitress was named Alice and she had great communication, was kind to my girls, and offered to get their food in first which helped immensely! I order the scallops and Brussel sprouts . The Brussel sprouts came out first and highly recommend! However the scallops took a very long time to come out and seared nicely however some were not cooked properly. And for that minus .5 stars. I will definitely be returning to try their cocktails, dessert and more menu items.</p>
<p>Pearl 6101 sits on a quiet street, but the restaurant and bar are bustling and busy. It has wonderful and beautiful interior, with great food, good service and a cozy and homey atmosphere. It's definitely a great place for a date night or a night out with friends. Drinks: Pearl Cocktail (5/5)My sister and I came in and had the pearl cocktail which was recommended to us by the waiter. It's a must try! Food:Appetizer- Chicory Caesar (5/5) An upscale Caesar salad defined by a medley of flavors and textures!! It was shared amongst two people and was a great appetizer to have. Pasta- Handkerchief (5/5)A must when going to Pearl. I was at a loss of words when eating this pasta. The plate was completely clean when we had finished eating.</p>
<p>Came here twice for dinner. Enjoyed it both times! Got the steak and handkerchief pasta this time. The steak dish had so many flavors - good combination. It could have been a little more tender on the outside but overall very good medium rare. The pasta was good as well (!), just not as unique. Finished off with panna cotta which was super light and tasty! Only thing is that it is quite echo-y inside so it's hard to hear what each other are saying. Outside might be better for conversation, might try tha next time.food - 5/5service - 4/5ambiance - 3.5/5 (very loud inside, though cute interior)value - 4/5 (good price for the quality and uniqueness of dishes)</p>
<p>Came here for my birthday and will be going back. The overall decor and ambiance makes you feel transported to a quaint French bistro. We all got different dishes and we all wanted to lick our plates after. The favorite of the night were the scallops. Our server was pleasant and helped us pick a bottle of wine after our cocktails.</p>
<p>They have excellent food options and the food was well-cooked, nice portion. The place was wonderful and has nice seating. Welcoming vibe when we entered the places.The food was decent. Pretty amazing options. I had the Chicory Caesar salad taste fresh and nice flavor. The pasta was great. I also like the seared scallops, it was well-cooked. The drinks were great and perfect with my food. I had a nice experience there.</p>
<p>I came here last week after Config and I got the handkerchief pasta and it so good. The "noodles" were large rectangular pieces and it had grounded up meat with thin slices of Parmesan. I've never had pasta like this before but it was so savory and rich. Highly recommend.</p>
<p>Very nice. Went in the 30mins to closing to grab a good meal. First time and was very happy with the customer service and food.  Ambiance pleasant . Loud from big party but otherwise 10/10 will return.</p>
<p>delicious mediterranean white fish, medium rare lamb; refreshing kale salad and very decent brussel sproutsnice upscale cozy environment. lovely dark ambiance with warm lighting and a highly attentive and friendly staffspecial thanks to the waiters who arranged anniversary champagne and cake, recommend the blind butcher for a special night out</p>
<p>Visited Blind Butcher for a family farewell dinner and the ambiance was exactly what we were looking for, intimate and cozy. Although the restaurant is smaller, they do have a long table that can accommodate larger group. I definitely recommending ordering a variety of plates because they are shareable. Most known for their House Butchered Meats, the prime rib was juicy and perfectly cooked (coming from someone who does not normally go for the red meat). The servers were attentive, friendly, and stayed ready to refill your drink!</p>
<p>Hubby took us here right celebrate our 31st Wedding Anniversary and we of always invite our son everywhere we go as he is a product of Love! Let's start with the med height guy with a curled mustache I think who greeted us, he was meh not too attentive but okay, sat us down in the corner booth table because I asked for that, sure wished he told me of another booth table in the back with more space as we are very tall people, nonetheless we were snug & comfy which was all that mattered! Then a young blond guy with a half ponytail bartender I believe came and took our drink order! My son mentions happily to him ... it's my parents 31st anniversary... and this guy just had this blank stare as if he were saying in his head ... AND? ... gave him our drink order and another guy took our appetizer order maybe the guy who sat us down? Can't remember! Throughout the night a very tall handsome server who we saw treat every guest with a huge smile and laughter and silently I wished he was our Server! Entree time we sort of got my wish cause he came and asked if we were ready to order and the one that sat us down pushed through and said not so nicely ... I GOT IT ... and we watched the Happy one walk away still smiling! He later came and asked if I wanted anything else and I asked for more wine and could not help but squeeze in there how I loved how he treated his guests and his smile! Didn't get his name but I do remember his face and will definitely ask to sit in his area!  That was that! We loved the ambiance and if all the servers were like the tall guy, well you'll be seeing us more!Now the food ... absolutely delicious! The calamari was the only meh dish we had, kinda rubbery but had a delicious taste. Sorry won't be ordering that again! I love me some crunch and some tentacles in my calamari ha ha!Those other two servers would smile and be like the tall server this night would've been even more amazing! From the ambience to the food to the wine everything was just wonderful even with those two hiccups! So Blind Butcher we will be back but we will ask to sit in the happy tall guys area!</p>
<p>I wanted to give this place 3.5 stars. The ambiance is great, it was pretty packed on a Thursday night and in a great location in Castro. The service was a little slow (probably bc they were busy) and forgot our drinks until after the food came. The food was ok, I was excited for the Wagyu burger ($27) but it was a lot smaller than I expected, and the meat was SO dry I couldn't even finish it. I wish they put other toppings inside it like lettuce, pickles, or anything to give some juiciness. The fries that came with it were delicious though! My partner got a chicken dish that was tastier and more worth the price. The mashed potatoes it came with were really great! If I come back here, I would definitely try the Mac and cheese after all the positive reviews about it!</p>
<p>While we were eating at Blind Butcher, a guy casually walks by nekkid...full frontal and everything...and hardly anyone bats an eye.Except the tourist couple whose jaws were sweeping the floor.That's what I love about The Castro...if you got the balls to, anything goes!Been eyeing The Blind Butcher since they opened in 2019 (sister resto to Dunya and Lark). And, my curiosity further grew with their hype on socials. When Plan A fell through, Blind Butcher it is because last minute rezzies were very easy to get. But, rezzies weren't needed since it was pretty empty on a Thursday. So, if you're looking for last minute place for a weeknight dinner, Blind Butcher may be a good option.Blind Butcher is open for takeout and dine-in. No delivery. Dog-friendly outdoor seating.M E N UMeat-centric New American Fare with a Greek flair. $20 bottomless mimosas for weekend brunch. Full bar.D R I N K S* Casamigos Blanco ($18 x2): https://tinyurl.com/24ayuf8kRequested the tequila on the rocks but it came in a shot glass. I've never seen CB priced this high at $18/shot before.F O O D* Shishito Peppers w/ sea salt flakes, yogurt ($10): https://tinyurl.com/2rvd57etWarm, slightly sweet shishito peppers (not spicy) paired with the cooling yogurt. Wish there was more blistering for a smoky dimension, but it was otherwise a fine starter.* Mashed Potatoes w/ butter, garlic, paprika, olive oil ($10 x2)Oddly listed under the apps/small bites section, we requested it to be brought out with the ribeye but it was still brought out as an app. The mashed potatoes were deliciously rich and creamy but you can tell it was cooked ahead of time and heated to order (lukewarm). We were hungry so we ate it and requested another round to come with the steak.* Butcher's Wagyu Burger w/ bourbon caramelized onions, kasseri cheese, horseradish aioli, fries, ciabatta ($27): https://tinyurl.com/bdhspdau--Requested medium rare--Requested upgrade to truffle friesTasty, juicy patty with a sturdy ciabatta bun, cooked medium rare as requested. However, it was small and expensive compared to the bougie burgers at Nopa, Spruce, and Miller & Luxe that have a thicccer patty and same price point. I know wagyu is in its name but it's a buzzword that's loosely thrown around these days.Instead of the truffle fries, we received regular fries dusted with old bay (?). They were ok and could have been hotter and crisper.* 16 oz Prime Ribeye, rosemary-oregano marinated w/ chimichurri ($68): https://tinyurl.com/pwyn35kh--Requested medium rareLooked awesome and the medium rare was on-point! However, for being a marinated prime cut, it was quite chewy. I know it's shrinkflation times but Lolinda has a similar 18 oz ribeye for $52. The accompanying chimichurri was hella salty so I appreciated that it was on the side. The ribeye includes several pieces of roasted potatoes, shishito peppers, and a tomato. Had we known this, we wouldn't have ordered another side of mashed potatoes.S E R V I C E Our server was nice and upbeat. Maybe it was an off day but service was too lax and lacked attention to detail. After we finished our meal, we had to go inside twice to ask for the bill...in a near empty restaurant (only one other table occupied).Food service was fast; apps arrived within minutes of ordering.A M B I A N C ECozy and sultry date night vibes with red banquettes and nice bar area. There's four patio tables in front.P A R K I N GChallenging street parking so give yourself an extra 15-20 minutes. No nearby garages.Overall, I have mixed feelings about Blind Butcher. While they nailed the meat temps, I didn't think the food and service was commensurate to a $100 pp dining experience. IMHO, there's plenty of other places in the city you can better spend that monies. Glad I tried it once tho.</p>
<p>This place is so so yummy! My boyfriend found it on tik tok and we gave it a shot during one of our weekend stays in SF. We had the ribeye board and it came with shishito peppers, tomato, potatoes and a side of chimichurri. The ribeye was SO good and the bucatini we had was delicious too. Definitely a higher price point restaurant but everything was delicious even our cocktails. I wouldn't think twice about coming again!</p>
<p>Absolutely amazing food, service and ambience! It's in a busy area in the Castro so plenty of do after dinner!We loved that they were able to accommodate our big group and sat us pretty quickly. Our waiter, Curtis, was amazing and extremely attentive the entire evening. Even reading the note on open table that it was our friends birthday and brought him out birthday desserts. The food tastes just as good as it looks! Id recommend sharing the ribeye and ordering some sides. It's good enough to feed 3. It's a big boy! Our friends ordered the rosemary chicken and not pictured is the Wagyu burger which my friend said he could lick and eat the whole plate! Will be coming back soon!</p>
<p>Came in on a wednesday night to celebrate a birthday. We had reservations so we were seated right away. There are a good amount of tables along the wall in a pretty intimate space. We noticed it was quite busy even for a wednesday. We ordered calamari, potatoes, prime rib eye, and pork chop. We loved it all. The rib eye was cooked perfectly medium and came with little potatoes and peppers on the side. The pork chop was moist and had lots of carrots and potatoes in the sauce. The calamari was thick and tasted really well with the sauce. The potatoes were a great side and perfectly cooked. We did family style and between the 3 of us, there were still some leftovers. We ordered the opera cake and tiramisu for dessert. The cakes were moist and rich and a perfect way to end our dinner. Overall i was really impressed with the food and cant wait to come back again.</p>
<p>DON'T LET THE NAME FOOL YOU - Great place even for vegetarians / pescatarians!!! Their Hip wood-based decor with ambient lighting makes for a cozy date night spot.Started off with some fresh fries lightly tossed in spices. Crisp outside, mushy inside (perfect)! They served some chardonnay to go with the appetizer. The main course was a family style butcher board (which my friends verified was delicious) and the lobster mac & cheese. Generous portions of lobster in the dish, with a perfect crisp cheese layer up top and gooey bits inside. The mac and cheese was served in a cast iron pan which kept it warm throughout our meal. Macaroni was al dente, and the bite on the pasta mixed so well with the mushy cheese! Service was excellent and they accommodated my vegetarian dietary preferences by serving me a Moussaka from their neighbor restaurant "Lark". It was mildly spiced and had lots of fresh veggies. Finally, the merlot that was served with the main course was rich with some fruity notes. Great for sipping though a conversation. Must visit the Blind Butcher!</p>
<p>I was really impressed with the branzino and the Elderberry cocktail, but less so with the practically raw shishito peppers. The service was scatterbrained and we were often left waiting long periods of time to place orders. Our two hour meal could have expediently been half that with more attentive service. The dining area was nevertheless nicely decorated and dark enough and loud enough to impart some privacy, though not so much of either to be miserable. Overall, standard overpriced meal in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Before I dive into my review, I want to mention that for me personally, food alone is 3/5, but I gave an extra star because of the ambiance.Let's talk about the food first. My friend and I ordered these dishes -1. Butcher's wagyu sliders (small bites)2. Crispy calamari3. Rack of lamb4. TiramisuWagyu sliders were definitely bigger than what I had in mind. The meat was very juicy, and the buns were soft. That, combined with the aioli sauce, made the sliders delicious. Crispy calamari wasn't much crispy and was okay. The rack of lamb was also okay. The meat was very tender and well cooked but lacked flavors. It came with horseradish sauce, but it was too strong. Tiramisu was delicious. It was very light and just the right amount of sweetness.This place is a great date night spot because of the ambiance. It's very modern, cozy, warm, and welcoming. The walls are covered with photos and paintings of old artists and San Francisco city from back in the days. There was jazz music playing in the background, and I liked it, though I wish it wasn't as loud. Our server was really nice and was on top of taking care of us.</p>
<p>Years ago, I raved about this place and awaited the day I would come back. Unfortunately, the dishes weren't as incredible as I remembered. Besides the brussel sprouts, which were seriously the best appetizer I've had recently! Each piece was a crispy, sweet and salty morsel that would change anyone's mind about this vegetable. The Grilled Prosciutto Burrata appetizer was a favorite as well. Other than that, the wagyu burger which my group and I all ordered was pretty average. I guess in my head I hyped it up so as I ate it, it felt quite dry and underwhelming. I ordered mine cooked medium too so not sure how it didn't hold its moisture. The ciabatta was dry and complicated the burger experience too. Another dish that fell short was the truffle lobster mac and cheese. As much as I wanted to believe there was lobster in this, I feel like it was crawfish... the flavor, the size, all just insinuated crawfish in the soupy cheese sauce. It had somewhat of a fishy/seafood flavor to the dish and no noticeable truffle taste. Although the entrees underperformed, the service absolutely did not. We didn't have a reservation and they were booked for dinner, but the host made it work with some open outdoor space. He constantly made sure we were comfortable and got our food out quickly. The chef also stopped by our table throughout the meal. He was bouncing between their neighboring sister restaurants and thanked us for visiting them. I would come back for the apps, drinks, and hospitality!</p>
<p>The moment I had got there it was a great ambiance. It was a busy night and I thought I had out my reservation in but it was on the wrong day! They were very able to accommodate me anyway! Plus one star! Staff and service was very nice. Overall: 1 star added for the service alone which was very friendly, but as a food critic and something of a culinary artist myself I cannot bring myself to give this place more than one star for the food.The nitty gritty:I ordered the prime ribeye medium rare and came out super rare. The cook must have not let it sit the appropriate amount of time before cutting and serving.The octopus was undercooked as well, leaving a gummy undercooked seafood texture we all know as sashimi shrimp.However the sauce and herbs surrounding the dish was superb and I ate each bite with it.The back of the octopus was cooked perfectly so they must not have used something to hold it down as it grilled.We ordered the calamari which was greasy and the breading was soggy :(.The waygu burger was alright but still undercooked to how we had requested.Truffle fries were really good.I was really amped to go here and try it out due to the hype on social media and I feel they may be overwhelmed by all the new attention it has been receiving.The taste was all there but the preparation needs work. For the price it cost to eat here I may not be coming back.It was a nice effort though. They were pretty crowded.Edit: I actually decided to downgrade my star review because the dishes were unique and good quality. But I shouldn't be paying over 180$ for a meal that is brought out raw. I know what kind of neighborhood it is but not everyone likes it raw. Also if there is something wrong with every single dish we ordered, quality control must be instilled. Idk if he was on vacation or what but this was completely unacceptable.</p>
<p>Welcomed and enjoyed our evening assisted by Manny. We ordered the Brussels sprouts- very tasty! Also the burrata ravioli and the short rib- plentiful portions and good flavor. Frankly the ravioli tasted more like ricotta than burrata but the freshness of the homemade pasta and the delicious sauce were fantastic. Short rib was fall off the bone and the amount of the meat was commensurate with the price. Lovely meal. We chose toeat  outdoors which was great but inside looked so cozy and hip!</p>
<p>Everything was cooked to perfection and seasoned well. I thoroughly enjoyed the steak, and absolutely loved the octopus appetizer. The service was really quick, we didn't wait long for any of our dishes, including water refills & check. Would highly recommend!</p>
<p>Cozy/moody ambiance, wonderful service, and delicious, flavorful food. We especially loved the roast chicken with veggies and potatoes, short ribs and potatoes, and the overall variety of dishes they offer. There is something for everyone, and the dishes are shareable. Drinks and dishes are on the pricier end however the quality is good. Hope to visit again soon.</p>
<p>Celebrating an early bday for bff-fam at Blind Butcher. Ever since they posted their iconic celebratory reel on the gram, we needed to check out all the fanfare it generated. Vibes are completely chill w/ eclectic art, plush red booth seats, and dim lighting...giving jazz club vibes for cool cats. Menu is simple there are apps, protein options and whole braised branzino to feed a small family of 9...so we got two of those because why not. lol Please do not sleep on the apps: Crispy Calamari, Grilled Octopus, Shishito, Truffle French Fries... and the table ordered to share Braised Short Ribs, Lamb Chops, Ribeye Steak, & Prawns. The kid ordered their lobster truffle mac. Dylan helping our table was amazing...beautiful, attentive, and super accommodating and friendly. Made the dinner so comfortable and our groupreally enjoyed. Go here and order everything. Street parking and a lot off Castro St. entrance, we got lucky and found one right in front. Planning to revisit in the near future! Thank you/Mahalo Blind Butcher!</p>
<p>Came to Blind Butcher to Celebrate my daughter's birthday and the host and everyone around was so nice and welcoming. Love the atmosphere and the food was 10/10 We all enjoyed our dinner party and will definitely be back.</p>
<p>Came here for an early Father's Day celebration.  We ordered a few dishes and decided to do it family style.  Everything was delicious and came out relatively quick.  Definitely worth a revisit. My only critique is that there were 5 of us and two small round tables were put together to accommodate us.  Sitting wise we had plenty of space but once the food came it was a game of shuffle to make space.</p>
<p>Second time here, absolutely fantastic. Gnocci is to die for, and the chef/wait staff are fantastic. Great spot!</p>
<p>Ambience was amazing 10/10 so classy clean modern, service was very welcoming, fast and beautifully put together, best of all the food I had was delicious, I orders the filet mingon best steak I've had</p>
<p>I live just around the corner in Marina and wanted to try this new spot. Don't let the lack of guests inside steer you away (it's brand new) -- This food was EXCELLENT. Some of the best I've had along Chesnut Street. And the servers were incredibly attentive and kind.</p>
<p>Excellent service!! Came here for my birthday with a group of friends. I highly recommend this restaurant. The crew sang happy birthday for me and provided a yummy dessert. The food was amazing! I had the grilled salmon. They also have a huge selection of wine. Alina and Berry served us and they were wonderful. The ambiance is very nice and classy. It's perfect for a birthday dinner where you can dress up and take pictures after.</p>
<p>It was such a great experience! Seems like they just opened a few weeks ago, and we would highly recommend! Everything from decor to food to service to location and the restrooms were on point. We sat outside, and it was the most beautiful sunny day to dine outdoors. Esvet was so awesome! We got the beef meatballs, linguini, beet salad and key lime pie. I hear the pie is a 20yr old recipe, and it definitely didn't disappoint. Soooo yum! Coming back for the bread pudding next.</p>
<p>Wonderful restaurant and experience in the Marina.  Ambience is great (although it is a bit noisy - just FYI).  Very pretty restaurant with comfortable chairs and great location!Service was impeccable!  Everyone was extremely nice, servers were attentive and the timing was perfect.Food was very good.  We started with the prawn appetizer, I had the salmon and Mr. had the linguini.  Judging by the way he scarfed that down, I would say it was a winner!  Salmon was good along the yummy vegetables served with it.  The prices are not bad either.  Most entrees are in the 20-30.00 range.  The starters and salads are less than 20.00.  Next time I would love to try their beet salad and skirt steak so we'll be back!</p>
<p>We happened to be walking by looking for a lunch spot this Sunday and noticed this new beauty! They opened two weeks ok just off Chestnut street on Steiner. The gorgeous interior decor and furniture  caught my eye. We essentially ordered the entire starter menu minus the prawns . The most delicious item was (allegedly) a butternut squash gnocchi, but tasted more like a delicious Alfredo to me! Pasta was cooked perfectly. Wish I didn't have to share it ;pThe boys really enjoyed the steak tartare despite and exorbitant amount of cheese on it. The calamari was sadly inedible- super dry and cheery. Berry our awesome server kindly removed it from our bill on her own. Burrata heirloom salad was good! Just feel like plating should be reconsidered. Each tomato slice was pretty huge and somewhat awakes to cut. Meatball was a hit as well, delicious sauce. They serve wine and beer as well and I could not stop loving the flower ceiling we had outside. For just their second week up and running, they nailed it. Will definitely return!</p>
<p>The restaurant has a very nice interior. The service really shines here. Our waitress Berry was super nice, attentive, and made good suggestions. The appetizer Gnocchi has a cream sauce that's really tasty. The Steak tartare was ok. I'd prefer more seasoning though. The Filet Mignon was very good. My second favorite was the seafood pasta. The Salmon and Chicken breast was also pretty good.</p>
<p>Ambiance is super cute, great for lunch and/or date nights. The staff is very accommodating and attentive, they will keep your glass filled and your stomach full. Food is delicious, I had the penne chicken (not pictured because I got hungry), everyone enjoyed the roasted chicken, salmon, and the steak. Everything's was cooked to perfection, you can tell that this business truly cares and they check on you to make sure that you're well taken care of. I'll definitely be back with friends, family, dates. Thank you for hosting our party and making it a great experience for us!</p>
<p>We had a great time at Bagatella for dinner. The restaurant is beautiful inside, and our server was friendly and attentive. To start, they provide complimentary house-made bread with truffle butter. We ordered the steak tartare, broccolini, pan seared chicken breast, and seafood linguini. Everything was delicious, but the standout was the steak tartare, which was some of the best we've had in the city. We will definitely be back for that dish alone. They also provided a key lime pie on the house for dessert, which was such a nice touch and a very delicious end to the meal. This definitely a great date night spot, and somewhere I'd take friends for a more intimate dinner.</p>

<p>Title: A Culinary Gem in SF Marina - Bagatella Shines Bright!Review:From the moment I stepped into Bagatella, the new culinary sensation in SF Marina, I knew it was going to be an extraordinary experience.

Whether it was the perfectly seared scallops or the robust flavors of their signature pasta, every bite was a delight.Service at Bagatella was impeccable. The staff struck a fine balance between professionalism and warmth, making us feel both valued and pampered. Their recommendations were spot-on, enhancing our dining experience significantly.It's the little things that often make a big difference, and Bagatella's attention to detail was evident in everything from the ambiance to the perfectly timed courses.

It's a must-visit destination that earns its stars and then some. Five stars don't seem enough for such a dining treasure!</p>
<p>If you haven't been to Bagatella yet you must go! The service is amazing. From the host, to the server, to the owner they're all very kind, friendly and personable! The ambience is unbelievable. Truly an instagrammable restaurant!! We started with a beet salad, burrata and heirloom tomato and steak tartare! By far the best steak tartare I have ever had!! Must try!!! My favorite starter was the Gnocchi!!! It's a must try!!! I had the spaghetti meatballs *chefs kiss* as the entree and my friend had the filet mignon! The filet mignon was cooked to perfection!!!

And of course the crème brûlée did not disappoint. I left Bagatella truly satisfied! One of the best dining experiences I have had in a long time! I plan to come back here very soon can't wait to try everything on the menu!</p>
<p>I had a great dining experience with my wife last week. Charming design, delicious food, great service (Thanks Berfin), and reasonable price. What else I can ask?This place is brand new. If they keep going like this, I am pretty sure it will be a treasure of the city.</p>
<p>Our server Esvet is a legend, bubbly personality and extremely sweet to our puppies. We sat outside with 2 dogs & ordered 3 sides of grilled chicken for them. For the humans we shared the meatballs, the sauce was just perfect. Sweet and seasoned to perfection. They also served warm bread with yummy truffle butter. I had the seafood linguini and he had the special sacchetti pasta. See attached photos, beautiful presentation, plating, choice of table wear and ambiance. I can definitely see this as a cute date night location. They just opened and it's a overall very nicely done</p>
<p>Walked by this place and noticed it was new. Had all the classics you can expect at a good restaurant. Stopped by and ordered half the menu. Some of the standouts were:Stuffed butternut squash Gnocchi - top 3 gnocchis in my life, number 1 being a castle in Italy but Bagatella's gnocchi was up there with the best. Calamari -  fried with onion rings was delicious especially with the aioli Burrata and heirloom tomato it's seasonal fruit - chefs kiss on this dish, literally so amazing, fresh, and lightPeach wine cocktail - super dangerous how easy this went down.Bread pudding - perfect for the second stomach after you say you are full.To top it off, Dave provided amazing service, ensuring food came out hot, drinks full, and that we well taken care of. He went above and beyond.Overall 5/5 would come back and eat the other half of the menu with friends!</p>
<p>The ambiance was cozy and inviting, and the staff was attentive and friendly. The menu offered a variety of delicious options, and the food was beautifully presented and tasted amazing. I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a memorable dining experience.</p>
<p>out with the old in with the new. bagatella sports a vast menu with many options to choose from. if you're into an American, french, or italian taste this will be right up your alley. the city needs this new life that an establishment like bagatella brings to the neighborhood with the thoughtful decor and modern finishes, on top of a great dining experience.</p>
<p>Bagatella is a new restaurant in the Marina that is a must try! The ambiance is superb, with indoor and outdoor seating. The food was amazing and the service was fantastic. We got the Steak Tartare and Burrata as an appetizer along with Skirt Steak as an entree. Special thanks to Dave & Abe for their amazing service. The evening was everything we hoped it would be. I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely be coming back.</p>
<p>This new spot on Steiner has only been open for a month and I was very impressed by the service, ambiance, and the food. The appetizers were better than the mains (imo) but everything was great. The standout was the steak tartare for me. They also play great music and the staff are friendly. Would definitely come back for dinner and drinks.</p>
<p>Great food and great service (shoutout to Dave for being so patient and welcoming). Our favorite dishes were the steak tartare and the bagatelle bread pudding!!</p>
<p>No Fees</p>
<p>good food buenisima comida ya he ido varias veces se los recomiendo demasiado vayan y visitelos</p>
<p>Little Shucker is the shuckin' best! My husband and I came here for date night and we loved our experience.  The highlight for me was the oysters, raw and baked!  You could tell that the oysters were super fresh.  We had kumamotos, miyagis, and mere point oysters for our raw oysters, I believe. For the baked oysters, we tried the garlic butter (YUM), and the miso bone marrow (my personal fave!).  The spritz cocktails are really good too.  We tried the pink spritz and the lavender yuzu spritz (super refreshing).  I also liked that they had a natural wine on the menu. :)Little Shucker is perfect for date night or girls' night out!  The vibes and interior are super cute too.  Can't wait to come back.</p>
<p>I've been on an oyster kick these days and Little Shucker was such a fantastic place to dabble. It's not cheap and you can quickly rack up a bill here, but it is surely worth the price you pay. Everything is so fresh and tasty. My friend and I came for lunch with a reservation but it wasn't too crowded. We got six Oysters, the Halibut Crudo, Smoked Salmon Tartine, and the Roasted Nori Cauliflower. The oysters were incredibly refreshing, and we love that we got to sample all three. I also loved the small plates we ordered. The cauliflower was so umami and had a nice bite to it, while the tartine was so hearty and creamy. Service was decent. Nothing to write home about but the atmosphere does make it worth the visit, as it's bright but homey.</p>
<p>All the rave reviews are true - this place is a keeper! Perfect location and immaculate vibes, we loved everything about little shucker. We walked in at opening on a Saturday without a reservation and were seated immediately. The waitstaff was completely attentive and took our drink orders right away. One of our guests ordered a wine on tap, and within minutes was informed that they had to switch out the keg. She had to wait about ten minutes for her glass, and when it was brought to her, we were told it was on the house for her patience. She was offered alternatives but really wanted that wine, so despite her choosing to wait they still comped the glass - completely unnecessary but entirely grateful, we were won over immediately. Then the oysters came. In a city brimming with seafood options, this was the freshest of the fresh. We inhaled our dozen (with a variety from Tomales Bag and the east coast) just in time for the mussels to hit the table. When I tell you we were lapping up the garlic marinade, we were fighting over the last spoonful. For a seafood focused restaurant, their fries were also memorable, and the house hot sauce is  chef's kiss. Incredible experience all the way around - can't wait to come back to little shucker!</p>
<p>Fresh seafood, cute interiors, $2 oyster happy hour, and good wine...how could you not have a good time at Little Shucker. This buzzy Pac Heights seafood spot from the team behind The Snug excels when it comes to simple, good seafood. I sampled a majority of the menu, and my favorite item was the Big Shucker, a classic chilled seafood tower that allows the quality to shine. If you love oyster shooters, you have to try their two creative takes - a sake tomato dashi with uni and a play on michelada with kimchi and pilsner. In addition to the tasty raw oyster selection, I also enjoyed the warm bone marrow baked oyster.For more substantial bites, I recommend the smoked salmon tartine with bright dill cream cheese on a fluffy pan de mie. The hot lobster roll was fine, but not as memorable. I would skip adding caviar to the roll, as it got lost with the strong flavors.My friend and I were comfortably full from the seafood feast, but we couldn't resist trying the pretty greek yogurt tart with seasonal stone fruit - a sweet, but restrained ending to a solid meal.I like that the smaller space, friendly staff, and menu lends itself to many occasions, whether it's a casual lunch, early happy hour, or romantic dinner date.</p>
<p>Came here for dinner on a weekend.Food: 4Decor: 4Service: 46 oysters, 22miyagi, kumamoto, and mere point~4/5. Fresh and cleaned properly.hot lobster roll, 35~4/5. Fresh lobster in a nice, hot, toasted bun. Pretty good, although I think New England Lobster Co. in Burlingame is slightly better.Service was nice and friendly.</p>
<p>The cutest spot on Fillmore! Perfect for a sunny day in SF. We ordered the Rockefeller oysters, miso bone marrow oysters, garlic butter oysters and I would recommend them all. We added caviar to the oysters and it was We also got the lobster roll which came with a generous amount of seafood, and the branzino. I would say I've had better branzino elsewhere and would stick to appetizers and drinks here! Great place for friends</p>
<p>Ambiance- decor was really nice and clean, bathrooms were well maintained and the table tops were tidyService- a little awkward and choppy but nice people, but incredibly slow for certain food items Food- some things were delicious and other things needed more attention*Big shucker- presentation was pretty, I think that the oysters were shucked fine, a little shelly but no real complaints. We sat at the bar so we watched them prepare the tower in front of us. The shrimp was really dry and didn't taste fresh at all, however the mussels were our favorite part! The Maine lobster was fine,nothing extraordinary and the geoduck was also okay. *lobster roll- I can't believe they charge 2$ for the chips when the roll is already 35$ I think that's absurd. It was also a small portion and lacked a sauce (butter isn't a sauce) **smoked trout salad- it reminded me of a deconstructed lox bagel in a good way. I wish the portion size was larger or if the plate had more lettuce ** we received our big shucker first at 2:15 and quickly finished the tower in about 10-15 mins because there wasn't a whole lot to it and we were super hungry. But we weren't served our salad and roll until 2:45 which we thought was a super long time to wait between plates. Especially because it wasn't particularly busy and the components of our plates were already made eg: the lobster was precooked and the trout was smoked so assembling the items on a plate shouldn't have taken too long (time stamps attached).  Price- not good, I hadn't realized or noticed that there was a 20% automatic service charge which I think is quite high (for this particular place). We were a group of four but they were kind and they split the bill into two for us because they noticed each couple shared items. I think 17-18% service charge is more realistic. Especially because we had really slow service between our plates.</p>
<p>I have been craving baked oysters lately and it's actually quite hard to find.   Little Shucker appeared on my search and they had a reservation opened so we gave them a try. The ambience is so cute, it's so bright and welcoming, it reminds me being inside sometimes home in some coastal town.  They tend to get busy around 6pm, so I recommend making reservations. They have a happy hour menu too, and if you want that deal you have to come before 5 pm.  For Happy Hour they have raw oysters for 12 or 24 dollars depending if you get half a dozen or a dozen.  And of course, with happy hour there's wine or beer.  For our starters we did get the dozen oysters for $24.00 along with the crudo.  The fresh oysters were good and plump.  They gave you three sauces to pair with, the green sauce was the best. The crudo was paired with their avocado mousse and tomatoes which was so tasty!  I wish they gave us more of that mousse.   We also go the baked oysters which included the rockefeller, garlic butter, and miso bone marrow.  All of these were good, but i think my favorite was the Garlic Butter, followed by the Miso Bone Marrow and then the Rockefeller.   The miso bone marrow said it had cilantro but i couldn't taste it, which was good because i'm not a cilantro fan. The Lobster roll was delicious as you can taste how buttery the bread as and how sweet and juicy the lobster was.  It does get very messy to eat but it's worth the messiness. I hope they can expand their menu soon like their sister restaurant The Snug. I would love to come back and we can tell their staff is a great team as i see them working so well together.</p>
<p>Charming ambiance, delicious flavors, fresh seafood. Favorites were baked oyster miso bone marrow, lobster roll, and mussels.  Branzino was great as well.</p>
<p>This is a great date night or outing spot in SF. I would 100% return for the baked oysters, especially the miso bone marrow. The service was incredibly attentive and we felt the dishes were fresh & delicious. The ambiance was nice, ample spacing around the tables, lighter color palette of the restaurant makes it feel larger, and it wasn't overly loud. 10/10</p>
<p>Summary:Casual seafood cafe offering a small variety of tasty bitesDetails:Little Shucker reminds me a bit of the seafood spots you'd find up in the PNW, with their casual, but creative take on various seafood dishes, albeit with a more limited offering. That's not to say you can't get full here if you order enough of the right dishes, but it definitely has more of a "come here and chill with some drinks and light bites" vibe than a "come stuff your face and belly" one.Everything we had was pretty tasty, but the standouts included their garlic butter baked oysters (the miso bone marrow was just a tad too salty), halibut crudo, and hot lobster rolls (which is prepared differently than their cold), all of which came with very fresh ingredients, and some tasty, yet bright flavors. And honestly, the nori cauliflower was pretty tasty too, but it felt to us like it was mostly just a bunch of tasty banchan dumped on top of roasted cauliflower lol, so the value wasn't quite there on that dish.Worth a stop by, but probably more as the precursor or successor to a nearby meal.Accessibility:Can't speak for the interior, but plenty of accessible outdoor seating!</p>
<p>My recent visit to little shucker in Pacific Heights had its ups and downs. While the lobster roll was meaty, it was on the pricier side and, unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations - it turned out to be rather average.On a more positive note, the Caesar salad was decent and made for a suitable companion to the lobster roll.If you're on the hunt for a great lobster roll, I'd recommend waiting for Broadstreet Oyster to open up in Ghirardelli Square or stop by New England Lobster Company when you are near SFO. The service at little shucker was good, but for a memorable lobster roll experience, it seems I might have to venture elsewhere next time.</p>
<p>My friend brought me here for lunch for a belated birthday. This place is spectacular! All the staff was attentive, friendly, and accommodating, which made the experience so fantastic. I will be returning in the future. Shout out to everyone for such a good experience. The crudo, fried oysters, and the wine options were delightful.</p>
<p>We dined here for lunch. Our group comprised of five adults and two babies. The service couldn't have been friendlier and attentive; especially with our babies joining in on the meal. We ordered oyster shooter lights, the chips and dip, the bread, oysters in the half shell, and the crudo. We happened to be there for happy hour, so that was a pleasant surprise. The shooters were inventive and fun. Everything was presented nicely and most importantly, it was fresh!</p>
<p>Oysters? YES! YES! YES! This new space (in the old Grove location) on Fillmore is just what the city has needed. A simple menu for indulging in fresh seafood, alongside a beautiful wine selection and bar. The restaurant is open and airy with fresh bright colors that just invoke a clean feel. Most oyster and seafood restaurants have a distinctly fishy smell, but not here, no no. We kept it simple with a couple dozen raw oysters, a couple of orders of baked oysters (who doesn't love Oysters Rockefeller?) and the Chips and Dip with the Caviar addition. I had a few Lavender Spritz that were refreshing and light. -Plenty of counter seats to watch the shuckers do their thing or table seating both indoor and outdoor-Unisex restroom -Reservations HIGHLY recommended to insure you get a seat -Service was quick and attentive JUST TREAT YOURSELF & get here if you love Oysters!</p>
<p>Little shucker is has the cutest vibes! My partner and I love oysters so decided to give this spot a try. We got 6 oysters (2 of each type they had), the halibut crudo, mussels, and hot lobster roll. The oysters were super fresh! They give a lemongrass mignonette and two hot sauces with it. The olive oil on the crudo seemed really high quality and had such a good flavor, but honestly I thought it overpowered the halibut a little bit. The mussels were fire. The broth they were in was so delicious, and the portion was pretty big! Id say maybe around 20 mussels or so? I got fries with the mussels too, and they were super crisp and still fluffy in the middle. My partner got the lobster roll, which was good although I think the bread was a bit too buttery for me.</p>
<p>Yayyyy new oyster spot in town :-) My friend booked a dinner reservation for the 4 of us-- AMAZING OYSTERS. To my understanding, they have a rotation, featuring some from Hog Island. Very cool & hip addition to an already quite upscale area.THE BIG SHUCKER: Perfect to split with a group of 4~ All extremely fresh & high quality. NEED to try their house-made green sauce-- it's fantastic.- SMOKED SALMON TARTINE: First time trying tartine on pan de mie, soooo pillowy soft and delicious. Small portions of salmon.- ROASTED NORI CAULIFLOWER: Hearty & umami-- even when shared, the small bowl is surprisingly filling- LOBSTER ROLL (hot): Ngl this is ok. $35 is high for a lobster roll... Tasty, but nothing insane.Only tried the seafood as we had 2 pescatarians in tow-- will need to come back to try the bone marrow another time.</p>
<p>This place really did live up to the hype! So glad we came. What a lovely weekend brunch. I rarely give out 5 stars but this place was very deserving. My sisters and I had been dying to visit this place after it showed up all over instagram and had such great reviews. We came yesterday at noon. It was pretty quiet tbh - their dinner reservations are much harder to get!We ordered a ton of delicious food -- the big shucker, which was great, everything was fresh and amazing -- the salmon tartine, also amazing, and I got the lavender spritz and the lobster roll (warm with butter vs. cold) and added caviar. The spritz was almost too pretty to drink but man was it good! And the lobster roll was absolutely amazing. Maybe just a tad too much butter, but all in all so good. And they give you so much caviar as well! Not cheap but definitely really good and the service was phenomenal as well.</p>
<p>Came for happy hour on a Thursday around 4:30pm with a friend. Most tables and seats were full but the hostess found us a spot in their stand room area. Drinks: NA spritze - was good, sweet with a hint of bitterness wish this had a little more acidity to balance the sweetness but still enjoyable Food: Raw Oysters - fresh small to medium sized oysters with a slight salinity, served with lemon wedges, mignonette and hot sauce, there was a bit of shell and grit in some of the oysters Baked miso bone marrow oysters - really tasty, larger in size, creamy and rich with some fattiness from the bone marrow and savory umami from the miso Service was fine, pretty busy during happy hour but  servers came by regularly to check in. The hostess brought out water when we were first seated. Overall a decent spot for oyster happy hour. You can only order oysters and drinks in the bars standing area so if you want a full meal definitely grab a reservation.</p>
<p>Make a reservation before you attempt to come here. I live in the neighborhood and tried without one unsuccessfully. The hostess quoted us "15min" for a party of two to be seated, but we waited there for almost 45m before giving up.</p>
<p>The food, sake, and service were exceptional. I can't wait to come back and try more dishes. The salmon curry was unique and delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly.</p>
<p>This place is such a hidden gem!  I've been here few times and was satisfied every time i went.  The place itself is simple and casual with a touch of elegance.  It was very cozy and perfect for friends gathering or even a date night.  Service was welcoming from start to finish.  They know their menu pretty well and gave good recommendations.  Food was outstanding with its unique flavors.  I felt it is a combination of Korean Thai fusion.Here's what we ordered, and the portions are pretty bigKimchi rice balls (4/5)Recommend* A perfect appetizer to share.  Crispy outside with kimchi flavored rice inside and topped a special sauce that made everything work.Tom Yum Noodle Soup (5/5)A bit spicy but the soup itself was very rich.  Highlight of the soup is actually the crispy pork inside.  Very delicious overall.Korean Spicy Noodle (5/5)If you like Korean style cold noodle, this is the dish you can't go wrong with. It was sweat and sour with a little bit spice.  Very refreshing. Bibimbap (3/5)This dish was ok, a bit blend. I would recommend making a reservation just in case.</p>
<p>Glad I got to try this place but I won't be back. I made reservations for 6:30 and got here a few minutes early. Parking was not the greatest but that was expected. We parked 3 blocks away.The restaurant was pretty empty upon arrival and stayed that way until the end of the meal. Together we ordered:Hamachi Kama 3/5: standard. I really liked the sauce that it came with. Thai braised chicken: 2/5 nothing special. Had a side of wonton noodles in a sauce that I didn't not enjoy. Cold spicy noodles with pork jowl: 2/5 flavors were great a few bites in but I was really struggling to finish it.</p>
<p>Kothai, the Korean and Thai fusion gem, not only impressed with its unique and delicious dishes but also stands out for providing one of the best service experiences I've encountered. The waiter went above and beyond by keeping us updated on wait times, setting the tone for a positive dining experience.The menu at Kothai showcases creativity with unique and flavorful dishes. The creative appetizers add an exciting dimension to the meal, and personally, the noodle dishes became a clear favorite.Adding to the overall appeal, the environment at Kothai is super aesthetic, making it an excellent choice for a great date spot. The thoughtful combination of delightful dishes, exceptional service, and a visually appealing setting makes Kothai a standout fusion restaurant.In summary, Kothai is a must-visit for those seeking a fusion of Korean and Thai flavors. With top-notch service, creative dishes, and a charming environment, it creates an ideal setting for a memorable dining experience.</p>
<p>New, Korean Thai fusion restaurant that lives up to its name. Wasn't too busy and the restaurant was kind of quiet on a Sunday 2pm lunch time. Service was quick to seat and refill water.5/5 Crispy Grilled Hamachi Collar was super fresh and came with a crunchy green chili basil crumb underneath that pairs well with the white, less seasoned parts of the fish. The dish would've been perfect with a scoop of white rice to soak up the crispy , not too oily bits of fish skin. 4/5 Thai Braised Chicken was solid, the meat was juicy and tender to fork off the bone. I liked how it came with mushroom but was surprised the sauce to pour over it wasn't salty or as umami.Luckily, I asked for their condiment rack and the green chili vingarette sauce was the perfect combo with the chicken. The spice one was alright, both were freshly made in house.Would come back with a larger group to try different items!</p>
<p>Delicious, spicy flavors exploding in your mouth! The Tom yum noodle wasn't too spicy but still had a Thai kick and lemongrass flavor. I'd definitely order the Tom yum again and the mushroom, bean sprout, egg, and not over cooked king shrimps (2) were delish. We mostly tried the Thai side of the menu,but it is a Thai Korean fusion place. The mushroom plate had a unique flavor dip and crunch with the leaves which had an acid taste too. The chocolate mousse was rich but not heavy. The berry compote was a nice addition to it too. We also enjoyed the crudo with smoked flavor and squid texture plus mango sauce with a kick. Also amazing. The vibe: clean, modern look on the corner of Judah and 9th. Clear glass windows and inside heaters with pretty wreaths. Hope it stays here for a while and will be in our rotation of places to come again to. We walked in at 7pm on a Saturday night and there was no wait. There was a table or two open !</p>
<p>20/10! So thankful I stumbled across this TikTok video to try Kothai. I was a bit skeptical to try since Bangsang (another Korean fusion restaurant) was super disappointing but I cannot say enough great things about this place! Besides the food being absolutely amazing, the service was what stood out the most. Every single person in there was so sweet, attentive, and food came out pretty quick!We had the Hamachi Kama, Kalbi, Iron steak, Ceviche, and both noodle soups. The ceviche, Kalbi, and Tom yum noodle soup is a MUST TRY! I'd love to come back</p>
<p>Sep 2023Solid. New place to try at the end of the trip. The decor is nice and simple, and the curtains were lowered so the sun didn't beat down on us. The service was friendly, and helpful with any questions we had. Check ins and water refills were frequent.We had gotten the kimchi rice balls to split. Compatriots ordered the Tom Yum and the Beef noodle soup. I got the bibimbap vegan with egg. The flavor fusions worked well flavorwise. The broths for both soups were rich and the balance of ingredients worked well. The Kimchi rice balls were a good opener with the sauce bringing a nice richness to it. I didn't lick the plate but I was close. The bibimbap was plated very well and presentation was really nice. The sauce brought things together tho it was a bit fresh for me. I'd want a bit of salt even without the sauce, and something savory to tie it.All in all definitely a good stop. I'd be interested to try other things on the menu next time.</p>
<p>I came here with a group of friends before Outside Lands, as we wanted to get some food at a Thai place that was not too far from it. While the inside isn't the largest, we were able to get a table to seat the party of 10 or so that we had. The service was good and while our food did take some time, I think that's mainly due to the larger size of our party. I ordered the Tomyum noodle soup and the kimchi rice balls. The portion size for the noodle soup is substantial, and I think for the price it's pretty worth. The flavors were good for the tomyum and the meat inside it were also cooked well. The Kimchi rice balls were pretty interesting, as the outside was quite crispy with the kimchi stuffed within. I think this is worth getting as an appetizer, and it's a good one to share with a couple others! Overall, it's a nice restaurant and would recommend trying it out!</p>
<p>Celebrated a friend's birthday and we decided to share everything family style.Bibimbap 7/10 pretty good but no wow factor! Def a fusion take though because of the carrots and coleslaw but taste wise wasn't too bad! We didn't try it with the peanut sauce so not sure if that would have been better or notSpicy cold noodles: 6/10 personally a little spicy for me! I also think that the pork jowl sauce didn't pair too well with the spicy noodles and the fact that the meat was warm while the noodles were cold was throwing me off a bit. But they were good if you ate them separately! I started eating the pork jowl with the veggies from the galbi dish instead and it was really good (also dipped it with ssamjang and the aioli sauce from the fried rice balls, bomb)Kimchi Fried rice balls: 9/10 i was pleasantly surprised!! It looks unassuming but it was actually pretty yummy and the aioli sauce was so good. It was the underdog of the night I recommend trying it. Galbi: 10/10 the meat was so tender, perfectly cooked, and was so enjoyable to eat wrapped in the veggies provided. A solid dish and a must get if you are sharing with your table. We shared among 6 people, but 4/6 were not so hungry. Portion size for the bibimbap would probably be like 2-3, the galbi is probably good for like 4 people to share. Ambience was nice and staff were all super friendly and on top of filling our waters!</p>
<p>Service: 5Presentation: 5Ambiance: 5Noise level: 5Flavors: 5+Prices: 4 (but in all honesty everything is expensive nowadays)</p>
<p>Made a reservation with a small group and got seated immediately. Most people in my group don't eat spicy so they made sure to lower the spice level to mild for all our entrees. Ordered: Kimchi Rice BallsBossam Tom Yum Beef Noodle SoupLoved the bossam and kimchi rice balls. Of the two noodle soups, I would choose the Tom Yum over the Beef Noodle. The beef noodle had a very medicinal broth which we were not expecting. The menu isn't too extensive so if you're looking for a lot of options this might not be the restaurant for you.</p>
<p>O V E R A L LMy friend introduced me to this restaurant and I immediately brought it back to my family/friends and I returned less than a month of my first visit. This place is such a hidden gem... I was so happy to have discovered this before it blew up. However, this place deserves all the business and hype!! I probably tried all the items on their menu at the time at this point.O R D E R(This is a late review so prices are older)Korean Spicy Noodle ($21) --- 10/5 Don't even think about it, just order it. I had this same dish twice and enjoyed this with 4 different people and everyone said this was part of their top fav orders. Kimchi Rice Balls 2 ($12) --- 4/5 This was really good but I think a bit more simple --- but done well. The sauce was amazing though! Tom Yum ($23) --- 5/5 Loved it!! It is a different take on it but it was still incredible.Beef Noodle Soup ($22) --- 4/5 This didn't taste like Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup, but it was a different take of it... still very good!Korean BBQ Skirt ($28) --- 4/5 This is where I give bonus points to the chef -- he came out and said he realized the first fix was not enough (not 8oz as listed -- and we noticed that as well)... and offered us a lot more to make up for it. Thank you for being so attentive in fixing this without us asking for it! Bibimbap ($22) --- I wasn't the one who ordered this because I normally don't go for Bibimbap, but I was told this was really good!Grilled Hamachi Collar ($20) --- 5/5 I ordered this in my first visit - not pictured here... and it was so bomb!!! This literally melted in my mouth and the pairing with the broccolini was just.... Amazing.S E R V I C EAs I mentioned prior, props to Chef for coming out and fixing a mistake without us mentioning it. O T H E RParking here is A PAIN. Absolute pain both times. Plan ahead... I believe we took over 30min trying to find parking. The inside is super cute and clean and it's on the corner so you can also people watch if seated in front of the windows.</p>
<p>Arrived for my reservation to this Korean-Thai fusion restaurant and was seated right away. I heard great things about this restaurant so I was really excited. The service here was excellent as they change out your plate and silverware  after every dish. The menu was really small l, but there was some interesting dishes that I wanted to try.Kimchi Rice Balls (5/5): This dish is a kimchi fried rice ball that is deep fried. It comes with bacon inside and layer on a bed of aioli. The dish was fried to perfection and balanced well with its crunchiness and the softness of the kimchi fried rice. It was a bit spicy, but not too spicy. I thought the aioli was kewpie mayo and tasted very similar, but I enjoyed the very generous amount of it.Korean Spicy Noodle (5/5): This was my favorite dish of the night. This cold noodle dish is refreshing and a bit spicy at the same time. We got the pork jowl option and there was a generous amount of pieces. The pork jowl just melted in your mouth like heaven.Tom yum soup (5/5):  Beware, this dish is spicy. This Thai staple was filled it ingredients like crispy pork belly, mushrooms, a soft-boiled egg, and noodles. The broth was very spicy and sweet. I really like the add-ons, especially the crispy pork belly.I really enjoyed my experience here and had one of the best dinners I've had in a while.</p>
<p>Ordered 3 entree dishes. The beef soup was amazing. Also ordered the roasted chicken, chicken was amazing, I think the dish could have used more noodles tbh. The last dish was the king salmon, the chef cooks it medium rare which was good but neither of us were into the curry so much....nice place nice service</p>
<p>Korean thai fusion place. Came on a Sunday upon opening and they were not busy at all. Servers were attentive and fast with giving us our orders.Everything we ordered was so delicious. Appetizers include the chicken toast and crying tiger skirt steak - which was like a lettuce wrap. I also loved their tom yum, but my other friends who tried it claimed that it was too "shrimpy." - just fyi for those not a big fan of a seafood taste.Thai braised chicken was delicious too!Loved the glass walls that gave the restaurant a vibrant look!!</p>
<p>Fusion food is great in SF, where diversity reigns and cultures blend.  However, it takes high concept to make it work.  This place seems to have put a lot of thought into their menu and cozy restaurant.  KoThai Republic is a spicy combination of Korean and Thai foods along with sake and other alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks.  We had Kimchi Rice balls - crunchy, flavorful and slathered with mayo; KoThai Ceviche is a burst of lime, shrimp, peppers on crispy lettuce leaves - this IS spicy!  The salmon yellow Thai curry with rice made me sweat.  Glad we had the Apple crumble cheesecake dessert, because it tamed the heat on our tongues when drinking water didn't soothe us enough.  Friendly, attentive, professional service.  With an open kitchen, we can see the chefs making their masterpieces.  Highly recommended - especially for those who want to wake up their palettes!</p>
<p>The service was great. However, the food left me yearning for something that is more fusion-y and creative. The cabbage wrapping around salmon and got served with green curry was interesting. It showed the techniques right there but I was puzzled by the kimchi.The spicy cold noodle with grilled pork was decent.</p>
<p>Asian fusion places are always hit or miss, and I would say Kothai is a hitMy boyfriend and I visited Kothai on a Saturday evening without a reservation. Luckily, the restaurant was not busy yet, and we were sat soon after. The menu features a variety of asian fusion dishes, focusing on Korean, Thai, and a bit of Chinese. We ordered chicken toast (4/5) and korean spicy noodles (4/5). The server was super attentive, always filling up our water. The ambient is also super adorable and modern - definitely pass the date vibe!</p>
<p>The overall ambiance was great in this restaurant and I loved the dining experience. We will definitely be coming back</p>
<p>This place was an ideal choice for an outdoor gathering with friends after a long week. The ordering process involved using a QR code and presenting your ID at the host stand (which initially struck me as odd, but the waiter proceeded to check IDs anyway). This system made it convenient for everyone to settle their bills individually in a group setting.I would rate it 4 out of 5, mainly because it was on the expensive side, but the food and drinks truly hit the mark. The pork buns, in particular, were a delightful surprise, offering a pleasing combination of sweet and spicy flavors with the addition of shaved jalapeños and marinated fatty pork. The tater tots were delicious, especially when paired with alternating dips of ketchup and yuzu mayo. While the Paloma slush was enjoyable, I plan to try the popular prickly pear next time.</p>
<p>Came here for a friends birthday on the weekend night and was seating at one of the larger tables. It seems the upstairs section was not open for the night, and it was packed. However, even though it was packed, we received subpar service. My friend who is a regular there was a bit surprised at the lack of timely service. I didn't think the staff was overwhelmed, with some of them seeing to take a lax approach to the night when I personally would have thought they would be checking in on tables or checking for patrons that were looking for a server to place order and waiting minutes.I got one of their coffee espressos (the name might be off), but its was delicious and worth the expectations that my friend had set.I enjoyed my time here and probably would come back!</p>
<p>3.5 rounded to 4 stars. Nice location, pretty great ambiance. You could order your drinks by scanning the QR code, we had a hard time finding the code because it was pretty small and taped to the side of the table. We had the Chamomile gin and Coconut daiquiri, both were pretty meh in my opinion. I was expecting the drinks to have more depth of flavor but they just straight up tasted bitter. I think the Chamomile gin was a bit lighter and had more flavor. In addition, each drink came up to $18 including tax and the gratitude fee which was on a more pricey side.</p>
<p>I definitely kept it snug at The Snug! It's up to par with other cocktail bars in the area but I do feel like they have their own hits and misses.My companion took me here after I got off work. The spot is spacious and clean with seating at the bar and tables in one area. Or a communal table and window seating on the other side. They also have plenty of outdoor seating. We chose to sit by the windows which beckoned natural light and a place to people watch. My main gripe is the 20% automated tip considering there is zero service from start to finish. You sit down, order and pay using their QR code, and receive your food and drinks from a runner--no interactions whatsoever which is sucky.Their QR code leads you to their lunch, dinner, and libations menu. Its comfort American and California fare is on the pricier end. Plus uniquely crafted cocktails. I enjoyed my drink and the Tots my companion and I shared--super crispy, not soggy, and good quality. We got Ketchup and Yuzu Mayo on the side. The Yuzu Mayo was phenomenally creamy and you could clearly taste the citrusy flavor. One more is they charge for their sauces so it does get costly!This is a solid option for a drink and bites for those in the Pac Heights or the surrounding area. Parking is on the street off Fillmore or surrounding areas. Ideal for pairs or small and large groups as it's inviting and roomy. Personally, I won't become a regular as the food and drinks are overpriced considering there's no service and a mandatory surcharge, but I'll come back on special occasions!</p>
<p>Came for post dinner drinks And will 100% come here againVery well executed drinksGreat breadth of speciality cocktails Cute ambiancePlenty of seating - inside and out Attentive waitstaff</p>
<p>First time here! Got the aloe vera mocktail and crispy zucchini. The mocktail was really good and I love the glassware it came in. The crispy zucchini was okay. I'm not sure how much I like the dipping sauce though but the zucchini itself was well seasoned. Love that they expanded their parklet and that you can pay your tab individually by QR code (or keep your tab open and add more things). Each table in the parklet as its own heater though not sure how hot it gets as it is high up. Service was really quick and they continuously cleared our empty glasses and tableware. Tip is already automatically added when you ordered so no need to leave a tip on the table or pay it separately.</p>
<p>I love coming here to grab drinks with friends during the week. The prickly pear is my favorite cocktail here. The Snug also has solid bar food so we'll usually order a few things to share (tots, popcorn chicken, fried chicken sandwich, and brussel sprouts are some of our typical suspects) Great spot on Fillmore!</p>
<p>Fried Chicken Sandwich is the reason I go here. Along with the fantastic cocktails. I trust the ingredients and the cocktails can be with or without alcohol.</p>
<p>We came here on Friday night for some drinks and dinner and were seated right away. FYI you order on QR code stuck on the table and keep an online tab that way.  A 20% gratuity fee is automatically added instead of tipping and the hostess also lets you know before you sit down. My friend got their Prickly Pear cocktail and I got their Margarita. She got a burger and we split some of their tater tots. The food is nothing super unique but it tastes really good. I think they are more known for their drinks. The prickly pear cocktail doesn't really have any taste to it other than the mezcal and the spice. It was hard to tell if the burn was coming from the spice of the jalepeno or if it was the alcohol in the drink. The margarita however, was pretty solid - it tasted perfectly tart from the lime and very refreshing. Overall it's a great place to come and have drinks with a friend.</p>
<p>What a perfect spot to dine outside with friends after a long week! You QR code to order and show your ID at the host stand (which I thought was odd but as the waiter then proceeded to check anyways) so it's easy to pay for your own items as a group. Ranked a 4/5 because it was very pricey but the food and drinks overall hit the spot. The pork buns were surprisingly flavorful and packed a nice sweet and spicy punch with the shaved jalapeños and marinated fatty pork. The tater tots were delicious especially when alternating between ketchup and yuzu mayo. The Paloma slush was solid but will definitely try the prickly pear nest them as it seems to be a popular drink!</p>
<p>A really great spot to grab drinks in the pac heights area! The staff is extremely friendly as well. There is a at code for the menu</p>
<p>What a cool place to hang out and have a bite and a cocktail. Great atmosphere and wonderful service.</p>
<p>This place gave off pretentious but damn did they really change my mind! The food is a bit pricey but the quality of the ingredients and put together was worth it. I got the pork belly buns and they melted in my mouth, cousin for wagyu burger and she went to heaven! My mom got the chicken salad and said it was the best salad she had had in years! The drinks were my ONE gripe. The cool rectangular prism looks awesome in the glass but you take it out and discover their is only actually a quarter cup of drink in their. So disappointed so I bring myself to in a very salty attitude take the glass to try it and it was SO GOOD. UGH haha! The spa water was very refreshing and perfect mixed and it instantly made me annoyed I couldn't continue being salty haha! Great spot! Will be back for pork belly buns and spa water!</p>
<p>The food was good,  we had the Hummus, which was really good! The burger was on point as well.  They only had a couple of beers on tap but Pliny the Elder made up for it. The  music playlist was nice, 90's vibe. Overall was a nice place for a quick bite or to hang out.</p>
<p>I've been to the snug about three times now and it has been a solid place. They have a self-serve QR code ordering system which you order from and the food is brought directly to the table where you scanned your code at which I thought was very cool there is a 20% automatic gratuity tacked on at the end of your bill which hikes up the prices and was a bit much for me and the single burger and popcorn chicken we got. The wagyu burger though, is pretty solid! The star of the show was the dijonaise and carmelized onions, absolutely delicious.  I'd come again but only for a special occasion.</p>
<p>Extremely rude manager with man bun/ponytail.  Was probably high on something.. regretted going here.. never again.. young guy not trained in how to be hospitable or behave with women .. sad</p>
<p>Great drinks! You order and pay by scanning a QR code. Only thing the service is limited but is there's a 20% service fee instead of gratuity</p>
<p>Came here on a Saturday evening after high recommendations, and could see (and taste) why the recommendation was given.Service and Staff:- Order via QR code on the tables- Some of the food was quick to come out (the easier foods to cook)- Drinks come out very quickly also Food and Drinks:- Nitro Margarita: delicious and does the job- Paloma Slushy: they mentioned the day we went was the last day for the slushies due to the weather changing- Spicy Fried Chicken Sandwich: ordered with tots and both were good. By no means the best fried chicken sandwich ever, but had good flavor - Squash Tempura: this was really delicious - would recommend ordering this.- Popcorn chicken: always a good hit, especially with the yuzu MayoMiscellaneous:- Indoor dining and outdoor parklet dining available- Typical SF availability for parking - Love that you can have your own tab from the QR code if you want (makes paying the bill easier at the end)</p>
<p>If you want a laid back chill type bar to go hangout with some friends this is the place to check out. The staff is friendly & the place is kept clean & everyone that goes are pretty chill & very welcoming to new comers.</p>
<p>YUM. The bread. The kampachi. The lamb. The apple cake (with their house ice cream!). Perfection! So happy to see this team's new venture. Will definitely be back and recommend!</p>
<p>Beautiful.  Tasty.  Great service.The pork, lamb rage with tagliatelle were delicious.The fixed menu makes dinner relaxing.</p>
<p>I've been eyeing this place for a while, and finally decided to come with a friend to get dinner here on a weeknight, and WOW it did not disappoint. When my friend made the reservation, we were only able to get Patio seating, and were worried it might be a bit chilly, but the patio was fully covered and quite warm! They even decorated it with nice foliage, and it felt as welcoming as if we had gotten a seat insideThe service was very professional and they took great care of us, our waiter helped us with the wine selection, and was accomodating when we asked to try a few of the options before committingThe food though really blew my mind. The meal consisted of a prix fixe menu with five courses, and each dish was so unique, fresh, and intentionalhere were a few of my favorites:warm bread and butter - started off strong with bread that melts in your mouthkombu cured kampachi - was very light and refreshing, the sauce was quite tastylamb tagliatelle - both the lamb and pasta were perfectly cooked, had a nice and light sour taste to itapple crumb cake & hojicha opera - I loved both of these desserts, we also got a third ice cream to celebrate my friend's birthday! the subtle asian inspired flavors were incoporated extremely well, the ice cream itself was incredible, the server told us that we could actually order pints of the flavors that were made in-house from Doordash under the name "Jack & Remi" (named after the owner and his dog - so adorable) Overall, a wonderful and memorable experience, I highly recommend checking this place out, and the ice cream too! :)</p>
<p>My friends and I were definitely looking forward to dinner at 7 Adams. It's the same chefs who used to be at Marlena and the concept here is similar - affordable Michelin star-level tasting menu with options and supplements.  We have been long-time fans of the chefs and their new restaurant did not disappoint.There were three of us so we were able to order all of the options on the menu.  It's five courses - crudo, broth, pasta, entree and dessert.  The crudo was Kombu cured Kampachi.  The broth was a squash veloute. The first two courses came with their bread course.  The pastas were the red kabocha squash caramelle, lamb risotto and ricotta gnudi.  The entrees were roasted black cod, Berkshire pork collar and A5 wagyu. They also brought farro and cabbage to share.  The desserts were Hojicha opera sponge cake and the apple crumb cake.  The A5 wagyu was the highlight of the meal for me.  The other standouts were the caramelle pasta, the bread, the cabbage and the Hojicha opera cake. The server overheard that one of our friends was gluten-sensitive and they brought out some gluten-free variations (bread, lamb risotto instead of tagliatelle and apple crumb cake).  I love the initiative here. Service was definitely at a Michelin-level and I love the neighborhood gem feeling.  We were comfortably seated in a heated outdoor space in the back. It's the perfect ambiance for a nice date or a dinner with friends.  The base tasting menu was $87 before tax and tip.  The A5 was $40 extra and the truffle was another $25 (both of these are great values).  We had a few drinks so this ended up being around $180 per person.  They automatically include the 20% service charge.  This is definitely a Michelin-star level dining experience.  Highly, highly recommended!!!</p>
<p>Finally, i got to come to 7 Adam. I've been waiting since the chef left Marlena and I have also tried their food before when they were doing pop-up. Which was really good. We got a spot at 5.30 right when they open the restaurant.The menu here it's prix fixe meal for 5 courses ( you could add supplement dishes , which I did ) will reveal it also for the price of 87$ The restaurant is really nice and modern, they have a patio space in the back which is beautiful. Really I like the light of the place. The staffs and service are top notch , really professional and take really good care of us. They started us off with warm bread and culture butter. Let's begin the menu First dish : charred broccolini, love the Smokey flavor and sweet from the broccolini and umami saltiness from mullet roe.Second dish : kanpachi cured with Kombu, fish was fresh and love the sauce , the dashi and yuzu flavored was my favorite Third dish : we had 3 different dishes and 1 of them is the supplement. First one was the red Kabocha caramelle, my favorite. The flavor combination is awesome. My wife favorite was lamb tagliatelle, pasta was perfectly al dente and love the sour flavor that come through with the richness lamb ragu. The supplement dish was ricotta ghudi with white truffle, if you enjoy richness of cheese and white truffle, this might be your favorite dish.The main : we ordered supplement which was the A5 wagyu , of course it's good but surprisingly, my favorite was the chicken, so moist, so tender , the sauce is so good.The dessert : hojicha chocolate cake and apple crumble cake , they're both nice but I was just still happy with the chicken haha. Really really recommended this place. The price is great and the food even better. Next year Michelin star. Better hurry up and try it before they get too busy.</p>
<p>Came by for dinner the other night and it was a decent experience. 7 Adams is run by the couple David and Serena from Marlena in Bernal Heights that had 1 Michelin star. Made a reservation via Resy and our table was ready upon arrival.Parking in the Fillmore area is easy as there is always the Japantown parking garage in case street parking is unavailable. The interior of the restaurant has been recently remodelled with front of the house wearing their own attire and back of the house wearing a 7 Adams t-shirt and some staff opting to wear a mask.Dining in the late fall, the draft from the door made the dining experience a touch chilly. The lighting in the restaurant was dim, which made eating some courses a touch tricky, especially with dark bowls for certain courses. The light at the table was helpful, especially for pictures.Dining was available indoors or outdoors in the heated patio.Started off with the kombu cured kampachi and this was a delicate and refreshing way to start off the meal. Moved on to the charred broccoli di ciccio and the flavors and cookking skill were world class. Excellent 2nd course.Opted for the ricotta gnudi with a $18 supplement and it was decent. The truffle was flavorful although the pasta might have been a touch overcooked as it was no longer al dente.Opted for the A5 wagyu ribeye with a $40 supplemnt and it was fantastic! The ribeye was seared on the outside and came out rare. The au jus complemented this perfectly. The beef tongue was braised and super tender and flavorful. The side of mushrooms were a delight too!The farro verde for the table was good although I preferred the glazed arrohead cabbage even more as the flavoring and cooking made this rather pedestian side stand out!The disappointment of the evening were the desserts. Both the hojicha opera and apple crumb cake didn't taste fresh. Both the cakes tasted a touch stale and definitely dry. I recalled desserts at Marlena that were much fresher and higher caliber. ~$160/head after tax, 20% service charge, and 6% SF mandates.</p>
<p>Fantastic new restaurant in the Fillmore neighborhood offering a prix fixe seasonal, five course tasting menu with a  fusion of modern cuisines (our meal had Japanese, Italian, and Californian influences). Everything was delicious, especially the kombu cured kampachi, red kabocha squash caramelle, lamb tagliatelle, and A5 wagyu ribeye!Service and ambience were equally solid.  If they keep this up, they'll  definitely get a Michelin Star soon, so go now before prices jump!Note that while they advertise a $87 per person tasting menu, because they include a 28.24% mandatory tip/service, it ends up being $111.57 before tax, and $119.07 after tax. Honestly, the meal is amazing and worth every penny. The servers and staff deserve that amazing tip. But I think it's unethical to misrepresent additional fees and try to distort pricing to feel lower to increase demand, so I'm lowering my rating by 1 star until they fix that.=== NOTE ON PRICING ===First, let me say that the restaurant business is hard, especially in an inflationary environment with increasingly high costs of capital. Servers and staff deserve higher pay, job protection, healthcare, commuter benefits, and more, and the entrepreneurs and investors also deserve an opportunity for return on their hard work/investment. However, I also believe that restaurant guests deserve honest, transparent pricing. And these don't have to be mutually exclusive goals.Unfortunately, SF restaurants seem to be aligning on deceptive practices and hidden fees to raise revenue, rather than simply raising prices.Here's how this looks at 7 Adams for just the meal (no drinks or supplements)$87 per person meal20% mandatory tip = $17.405% "SF Mandate" surcharge = $4.36 [see note below][=[But they actually calculate the surcharge on top of the tip, so it's really 6%]1% extra surcharge = $0.878.625% SF Tax = $7.50[But they actually calculate tip on top of the now 26% surcharges]2.243% SF Tax Overcharge = $1.95Total: $119.07I'm actually okay with a 20% mandatory service charge / tip - 20% is the norm (in fact, often folks tip as high as 25% or 30%), and no one likes to end the meal with math. Plus, as I said, servers deserve the 20% tip. (But this should not be included in the tax calculation.)But the SF Mandate Charges are a total scam. And the fact that they claim it's 5% when it's actually 6% is annoying.  See below for my note on these fees.And then they calculate the SF 8.625% SF sales tax ON TOP of the now 26% included service fees. (Typically tipping is done on the pre-tax subtotal.)Please, @7Adams staff, please just raise your prices to include all your fees. Your staff absolutely deserve healthcare, commuter benefits, and a higher wage, but those should be priced into the menu, not added after the fact.=== NOTE ON SF MANDATES ===This is NOT a tax, fee, or charge imposed by the city!Instead, San Francisco requires that businesses provide minimum benefits to employees, such as an $18.07 minimum wage, commuter benefits, and healthcare benefits for businesses over 20 employees. Restaurants should already have been offering these benefits (and many were). These labor costs should be paid out of the revenues generated, and so should factor into setting the menu prices - the way any business considers costs (both marginal/COGS and fixed/avg) in the price of goods. However, SF restaurants feared that raising prices would reduce demand, so instead they began quietly adding a surcharge to bills. These charges can be a flat fee or a percent of the bill, and range from 1% to 6%. They go by many names, including "Health SF Tax" or "SF Employer Mandates." Many visitors, especially tourists, are surprises to find this additional charge on the bill, but assume it is a city tax. Research has shown that guests order more food than they would have if these added costs were included in the menu prices, which is precisely why restaurants continue to hide bake in more fees, rather than raise menu prices. But this is unethical and deceptive and we San Franciscans need to start pushing back. Over the past couple of years, I've seen these fees go up from 1 or 2% to now averaging about 5%. Enough is enough.It's particularly bad for a new restaurant, like 7 Adams, to have these fees, because they just set their prices after these mandates were in place. I could understand for restaurants who set their prices 5+ years ago to charge a surcharge cover these new business costs, but for new restaurants, they should have priced the menu factoring in healthcare benefits and minimum wage ordinances.</p>
<p>We came the week they opened and they did not disappoint! We loved every dish and left every dish completely cleaned off. Really great value for their pre fixe menu. Also their bread and butter were so good, I wish we could get more! Service was great, super friendly and attentive. The ambiance is cozy and great place for a date night. Highly recommend!</p>
<p>Finally got here. Like many I was shocked by the sudden closure of Marlena. It was fantastic and thought it was well on its way to being an SF favorite along the lines of Third Cousin; intimate, Michelin quality, and fantastic staff.  Sad to hear there was some sort of falling out between the Chefs and the major investor.  I don't see how such a success could have such problems.  Profit and quality appeared to be going hand-in-hand. I for one would love to know all the gory details. But enough with gossip mongering.  Let's talk turkey, or in this case, tagliatelle, ricotta gnudi, and Berkshire pork collar. And Wagyu, that king of beef. First, the tagliatelle was to die for, but the pork collar was to live for. And what's life without that ever so tasty wagyu.  Add three excellent wines by the glass and it's a perfect meal. But don't forget the secret menu, as for the superb spicy boneless chicken wing, which a friend tells me is a homage to Chef Fisher's hometown of Buffalo.  Pro tip, get the supplements and enjoy.</p>
<p>From the moment I stepped into 7Adams, I knew I was in for an extraordinary culinary experience. Nestled in a charming corner of The City, this new restaurant has already set high standards in the world of fine dining, hinting at a future graced with a Michelin star.The ambiance of 7Adams strikes a perfect balance between elegance and comfort. Its decor, a harmonious blend of modern and traditional elements, creates a welcoming yet upscale atmosphere. The staff was attentive and knowledgeable this ensured a seamless dining experience.The highlight of 7Adams is undoubtedly its tasting menu. Each dish was a masterpiece of flavors, textures, and presentation. The menu, which changes seasonally, showcases the freshest local ingredients, each prepared with innovative techniques and artistic flair. The chefs at 7Adams clearly have a deep respect for their craft, and it shines through in every bite..While 7Adams is yet to receive its first Michelin star, the quality of food, service, and overall experience suggests that it is only a matter of time. This restaurant is not just a meal; it's a culinary adventure that leaves a lasting impression. Highly recommended for anyone seeking a dining experience that tantalizes the senses and celebrates the art of fine seasonal cuisine.</p>
<p>Finally, a new San Francisco restaurant worth raving about! Despite being open only for 6 days, this restaurant felt like it has been open forever. The service is on-point, the dishes came out at a great pace, and (most importantly) the food was just fantastic. Highlights were the milk bread - warm, buttery, and served with a lot more butter and a generous sprinkle of sea salt. Pure heaven. The black bass was also stellar. Easily one of the best dishes I recall eating this year. The fish was perfectly cooked- crispy skin yet with a moist, barely cooked interior. Paired with a decadent mussel beurre blanc, tasty Brussels sprouts, and salmon roe, this dish was perfect. Bravo!Decor was low key elegant and modern, and the service was prompt and attentive throughout. Highly recommend!</p>
<p>We had high hopes but unfortunately pretty disappointed.  Food was decent but not amazing.  We upgraded to the wagyu steak and the portion was really small for $40.  Black cod was cooked extremely well, but they put too much salt that made it inedible and smelled too fishy.  Dessert was really bad, also having one restroom in the restaurant made for a constant line.  On the plus side, service was Michelin star status and ambience was really nice.</p>
<p>Beautiful restaurant with lovely detail and ambiance. This gem in SF is so elegant. We tried the tasting menu which was impeccable. Every detail was thought out and executed with a purpose. I can't really pick a favorite but the lamb tagliatelle I could eat forever and the apple crumble cake is the best dessert I've ever had. Even though I'm allergic to fish I had to try the cod and it was JUICY! I would suffer for it again. I love how much class and progressive taste this restaurant brings to SF. I will definitely be back again and again!Oh yeah, my favorite decor is the mushroom lamp. So in love.</p>
<p>Having loved Marlena , we were all excited to try this new restaurant by husband and wife team. Located steps away from Japan town, the location was convenient with parking easy to find on a Thursday night. Upon entering the ambience was classy modern with a large beautiful counter for those lucky enough to get front row seats to the action.  The first two courses came together and paired well with the bottle of white we chose. Then came the milk bread rolls - amazing. The pasta course was absolutely delicious. There are 3 options. I tried the lamb tagliatelle. Pasta cooked perfectly Al dente. For the main I had the seared black cod which came with an absolutely delicious buttery emulsion that was poured onto the dish. With the mains came 2 different shared sides to share. Dessert options were apple crumb cake and hojicha opera cake. Both delicious. We had an amazing time and look forward to coming back soon for next months menu!</p>
<p>Atmosphere & First Impressions (5/5): From the moment we walked in, we were taken aback by the restaurant's modern and stylish décor. Every corner seemed thoughtfully designed, offering a true sense of sophistication that speaks to those with an eye for detail. The ambiance promises an elegant dining experience, and in this aspect, it certainly delivers.Service (4/5): We were met with a warm welcome, an immediate sign of the hospitality that lay ahead. Most of the servers were both friendly and professional, showcasing their knowledge about the menu and attentiveness to our needs. However, there was one particular server who seemed a bit out of place. His interactions were somewhat awkward.Food & Wine (4/5): The wine list is a standout feature, offering a wide variety of choices that would appeal to both casual wine drinkers and connoisseurs alike. As for the food, it was a bit of a mixed bag. Some dishes were a delightful explosion of flavors, showing off the chefs expertise and creativity. But, a few others lacked that punch, leaving us wishing for a bit more zest and depth. One thing to note is the portion size, especially for the entrees. They lean towards the smaller side, which might not satiate those with a larger appetite.Overall a decent experience, especially if you take into account this was only their 2nd evening after the opening.Note: 26% automatic gratuity added to every bill regardless of your party size</p>
<p>We were looking forward to dinner at the recently opened 7 Adams. Somehow we got a reservation through a @TableHopper "first ten emails" contest. We had been here a few years ago when it was Gardenia, a different restaurant with different ownership, and thank God this was a different experience.The first big difference we noticed walking in was there was a lot of light and space. We were not crammed in, and the entrance was much more inviting. We were seated quickly. We had a table by the front window and it was perfect. The waiter came by with the menus and the wine list . I ordered a bottle of 2021 Domaine de Panisse Le Mas Chateauneuf du Pape only to be told it was out of stock. Give that the price on the wine list was lower than a typical retail price. It was not surprising that they were "out of stock" and my guess is that they just took it off the list. It's never good when they don't have first thing you order. I decided to pass on wine.For dinner it was a five course tasting menu. There were a number of options within the tasting menu. I started off with a kampachi and it was terrific. The second course was broccolini and once again excellent. The third course was a lamb tagliatelle and it was the highlight of the evening. The fourth chorus I went for the upgrade ($40) for a Wagyu beef entrée. It was quite small and if I had to guess I would say maybe 2 1/2 ounces. It was fine. Finally, there was some sort of apple crumb cake for dessert and it was dry and a bit mediocre. I'm afraid.We arrived at seven and by 8 PM the place was pretty full. At that point it started getting a bit noisy though we could still hold a conversation. Prior to that, conversation was easy and acoustics were great. The lighting is just right. The anodyne decor could use a little art or color but that's my personal taste. Service was excellent. Given how recently the restaurant opened I was quite impressed overall.</p>
<p>One of the new kids on the block, this time with veterans from Marlene. Beautiful, welcoming space with open kitchen. First thing I saw were butter-coated mini dinner rolls being prepared. The restaurant offers a five-course pre fixe menu composed of many small delectable plates. There are also a few upgrade opportunities. The first course was two dishes-- kanpachi sashimi or crudo in a pool of soy sauce, very good. Broccoli came next and was one of the highlights of the meal. Next, a choice of two pastas: one veg and one lamb. The squash pasta looked like a piece of candy with a twisted pasta wrapper, flavors were rich and had the mouth-feel of meat in a pleasing way. Lamb and pasta was smooth and classic. Mains were black cod or chicken. The black cod was sauced with a mussel gravy and a few small bites on the side including a diminutive mussel. My fellow diners claimed the sliced chicken breast was fabulous, including the accompanying buffalo wing. The mains were accompanied by torch-charred cabbage and farro as the grain. Dessert was the only disappointing part of the meal. The chocolate -rich opera cake was topped by odd tasting pears, maybe asian pears, which didn't pair well with the cake. The apple cake was dry and more of a muffin than a cake. Both deserts had a scoop of the chef's homemade ice cream, which was fantastic. Service was strong and everyone was very welcoming. Wine list is good. The restaurant is on track to be one of the city's best, but best reserved for a special occasion at $150 a head all-in.</p>
<p>My wife and I celebrated our 6th year anniversary at 7 Adams and we had a great dining experience. The menu is a $87 prix fixed meal for 5 courses and the food was delicious.  A great value. We sat in the patio, which was covered and heated so it was comfortable. The service was amazing as the waiter and the other staff members were very helpful and friendly. We definitely recommend this place.</p>
<p>What a gem. My wife and I came in for a late dinner on our anniversary and had a lovely time and a fantastic meal. $87 + 25% service charge for 5 course meal.The vegetarian substitutions were on point, the service classy without being fussy, and at one point there was a slice of cabbage so tender you could cut it with a fork. Oh, and the portions were more than filling. No post-tasting menu tacos needed here.Already felt like a smooth operation less than 2 weeks post-opening</p>
<p>Absolutely tremendous meal. We were huge Marlena fans and while we knew Serena and Dave would up level it with 7 Adams -  weren't sure what shape it would take. But wowowowow! The delightful milk bread - decision made for you, already included. A full course of pasta deliciousness, you just have the torment of picking between the two. Wonderful mains and the additional perk of some elegant shared plates to build out the meal. And of course Serena's desserts with the incredible bonus of Jack & Remi ice cream! So delicious! The service was elegant (waves to Frederick) and the space is so gorgeous. Matte plates, shiny flatware and elegant stemware. We were lucky enough to sit on the patio and it was cozy, comfortable, and elegant. Everything was so special, and we can't wait to see what 7 adams does next. Genuinely very VERY excited for the Chefs counter!</p>
<p>Enjoyed celebrating my bday with my girlfriend and friends in my favorite rest tonight. From reservations, requested table overlooking the bay were all followed.Our food was excellent thanks to our courteous server Alex.Very friendly staff!They made my special day very very special!</p>
<p>Food e as excellentService was over expectations Ambiance was magnificentAll shouts out to Carlos our server. He was not assigned to our table but he helped us from beginning to end .</p>
<p>Everything here was excellent from the food to the ambiance to the service. Luis took care of us and was attentive, receptive, and friendly!</p>
<p>Fog Harbor is located on the second floor of Pier 39 overlooking the Fisherman's Wharf strip. We went at night and were fortunate to get a window seat with direct view spanning the Wharf area with the new ferris wheel all the way to the Golden Gate. Very beautiful.Although being in a major tourist location, the restaurant with sitting bar acts and runs like a well oiled mid range establishment you would find in any downtown loacation. We had a 15 minute wait so we sat at the bar and had a drink, I recommend the Fog Harbor Lager if you like the easy drinking stuff.Our menu:Blue cheese bread - buttery, cheesy, garlicky goodness. Will always order this!Crab cakes - Super fresh and meaty.Clam Chowder - amongst the best we have had in SF.Cioppino - No noodles, just fish. Extremely fresh and amazing fish with garlic toast in a tomato broth. Sooo good. As for Shawn, our waiter, he should be next up for employee of the month because he was personal, interactive and made us laugh. Bravo sir!The prices are a tiny bit scary not Halloween scary, actually very reasonable for a tourist area.</p>
<p>Food: I had the clams and linguini and I was so pumped to try it as I love to order this at other restaurants. But, I wasnt as satisfied as I wanted to be. There wasn't too much flavor and it tasted a bit bland. I suppose the upside was that it had quite a bit of clam meat and the noodles were cooked nicely. They definitely just need to work on the flavor of the dish. I hear the clam chowder is what I need to get next time so maybe I will order that and give this place another shot. Service: The service here was honestly meh. Our server wasnt really personable and didnt even make any recommendations. He just asked if we knew what we wanted. Also, I saw that he asked other tables if they wanted dessert and even brought them a tray of selections but he didnt offer us any. I was waiting to see if he was ever going to mention as most restaurants do and he just brought the check. Definitely service could use a bit of work here. Ambiance: The ambiance was very nice! The table we were sat at was near the window which had a very nice view. You could see the alcatraz from inside along with the water! I also appreciated all the Christmas decor!</p>
<p>Our server was fantastic and other staff was friendly. Another employee stopped by to help me tie my bib. I personally had a great experience celebrating my birthday. The calamari was great and we had the seafood platter for 2 , the shrimp was someOf the best tasting shrimp my personal favorite seafood of the smorgasbord. The pasta complimented the rest of the meal- yummy!Pleasantly intimate atmosphere for being in a touristy spot.</p>
<p>Hubby and I recently got the chance to try out Fog Harbor Fish House! It's been on our list of spots to check out in SF for awhile. Luckily, his sister has been here several times and spoke very highly of this restaurant.RESERVATIONS: Recommended! Fog Harbor is top rated on Yelp when you search SF. It's in a prime location therefore we highly suggest making reservations.AMBIANCE: Casual with amazing views of the bay. The restaurant has big glass windows around its entirety overlooking the bay. Even on their patio, they have dividers that give you privacy but you also get beautiful views of the bay and the bridge. MENU/FOOD: They have a large selection of foods as well as a seasonal menu. The average prices were $20-$50 per plate. We each opted for their clam chowder and also for their lobster ravioli, clam linguine with alfredo sauce, and mixed grill. All of these items came in fairly large portions, large enough to share. The clam chowder here is very delicious. Very creamy and loaded with so much clam. They gave complimentary sourdough rolls which complemented the chowder. The clam linguine is also creamy and the linguine is cooked to a perfect al dente. The lobster ravioli was superb. The ravioli skin was soft and held flavorful bites of lobster with ricotta. The lobster tasted so fresh! As for the mixed grill, it was our favorite! We substituted the shrimp for more salmon. The salmon was very tender and the seasoning on the salmon was out of this world. We couldn't get enough of it! The mashed potatoes were very creamy and the grilled vegetables were very refreshing with a hint of lemon. OVERALL EXPERIENCE: Easily one of our top favorite restaurants at SF officially. We understand the high ratings behind Fog Harbor now. The food is outstanding and the service was great. They were very accommodating towards us by opening their patio for us to enjoy a meal with our pug. Even though we were the only party outside, our waitress made sure we were well taken care of. We couldn't stop talking about the amazing food and experience here at Fog Harbor. We will always stop by here anytime we visit SF moving forward!</p>
<p>By far my favorite clam chowder in the area. They greeted us with a smile and we sat near a window that overlooked the pier. It felt very homey with all the decor and the place felt clean compared to other restaurants around the pier. We tried lobster rolls, clam chowder and fried calamari. All were super delicious including the fries. Will definitely bring family and friends here to try.</p>
<p>I was finally able to come back to this fantastic restaurant and this time, I brought nine family members with me. I spent the day talking this place up and hoped they wouldn't make a liar out of me.I'm happy to report that they lived up to the hype once again. Everybody at the table, including my mom who's a bit picky, loved Fog Harbor.I went with a cup of the clam chowder (never come here without ordering at least the cup) as a starter and the filet mignon with potato mash and wilted spinach as my entree.I've been to many steak houses and can honestly say the filet mignon I had here was among the best I've had. It was cooked to perfection and while I don't feel it needed it, the delicious demi glaze took it up a notch.We're currently planning a trip to the city this spring with our closest friends for their anniversary and I've already decided to treat them to dinner here. Seriously, I can't say enough. Great experience every time.</p>
<p>I went in with pretty high expectations for the food since it's a really well known restaurant at Pier 39, but left feeling pretty mediocre about the food, service, and ambiance. The food was okay, nothing amazing but nothing bad. The mussels were super different and had a sweet onion sauce to pair with it. It felt too heavy and too sweet to go with the mussels and fries. The fish and chips and clam chowder were pretty standard. Due to the extreme stuffiness where we were sitting, I couldn't stomach the apple crumble at the end and just wanted to leave for fresh air. Our waitress wasn't super friendly either, and just all-in-all left me feeling super meh about the place. It's definitely one of those places that feels more geared towards tourists.</p>
<p>We're giving FOG HARBOR the TOP Five 5 Star rating based on a few factors.First off, it has to fight the stigma of residing in Pier 39, known by locals in SF as a "tourist trap" type location.  It's actually high quality as an experience and the food portions, taste and prices are fair.  We were expecting to be gauged and get sub-part quality being at Pier 39.If this relocated to any other area in SF, it would probably be at the top of many local's lists, especially if parking was easy and traffic wasn't gridlocked to get to.So, if you're a tourist and see this place and worry about it being questionable with so many other choices, the right decision is to look at the menu first and if you see stuff you like, go here and don't roll the dice on other places which may not give you a solid experience as Fog Harbor does and has/had for us.We're locals in SF but came with visiting tourists, and everyone was happy.We had the Clam Chowder and one comment on the table was it wasn't "Salty" (a negative would be being salty) and that it was served "Hot" (and that's a good trait to be piping hot and allowed to cool down rather than come warm and end up being cold.We had the Halibut, Sole and Swordfish without any complaints and completely empty plates after indulging in the entrees.Yeah, they charge the dreaded "5% SF Employee Mandate "Tax" Surcharge" which I think all San Francisco restaurants do, on top of the 8.625% sales tax then whatever you end up tipping... so you are leaving paying 30%+ more than the menu list price on everything.  That's more of a comment on the state of San Francisco's policies than anything this restaurant can control or is at any blame for.The service was friendly, fast and accommodating.  They asked about food allergies and tastes/dislikes ahead of ordering, being very conscientious of their customers needs.They give complimentary rolls and butter which is always a huge plus never to be taken for granted.On a weekend night, you can find street parking for under $1 an hour as opposed to parking in the Pier 39 parking structure or paid parking lots.I'd recommend this spot to all.</p>
<p>This restaurant is so beautiful as you get to sit right by the pier. The waiters are so friendly and will provide great service. This place is such a great date spot or a nice place to eat. The seafood here is so fresh. Seared Pacific Cod - 4/5- the garbanzo beans overpowered the cod itself however if you ate the cod on its own with the aioli it tastes amazing. the fish was so fresh which made this dish more rich and flavorful. I'd highly recommended this if you are craving cod. Shrimp Brochette - 5/5- the shrimp was beautifully cooked. the butter had such a rich smell and when you put it on the shrimp it tasted amazing. the mashed potatoes were a bit bland but the green beans were cooked so well. Crab Ravioli- 4/5- the ravioli itself was very cheesy and the crab pieces on top tasted amazing. the whole dish was amazing overall but it was a bit too greasy for me. you also only get 4 large pieces of ravioli Calamari- 5/5- you could tell the calamari is fresh and not stored in the frozen fridge for over a month. it had a nice texture and it was perfectly fried.Overall i would come back here because the food is amazing and the ambience is so nice.</p>
<p>Such a wonderful spot! We got the clam chowder bowl with the sourdough bread and crab meat. This was my first time trying clam chowder and we absolutely loved it. We accompanied our lunch with calamari. I would definitely come here again and recommend to anyone checking Pier 39 out! Wait was 15-20 minutes to be seated on a Saturday in November, so not at all bad.</p>
<p>Visited Fog Harbor for the first time as my mother was visiting the city! Both of is are pretty serious seafood lovers and I have to say, Fog Harbor didn't disappoint!It was prime dinnertime around 6:30, but we had a reservation so seating wasn't an issue whatsoever. We got seated with a beautiful view of the water and got busy ordering!To start, we got the blue cheese garlic bread which was surprisingly good. I'm not usually a blue cheese person but I found these toasty and more importantly, yummy. I will say though it's a big portion, and it was definitely too much for just my mother and I, but that's a good thing! 7.5/10For mains, I ordered the Shellfish Platter which was this huge assortment of shellfish with a slice of toasted bread and warm garlic butter noodles beneath it all. Once again, it was a huge serving I barely finished and it was really good! It was a tad on the oily end, but I'd recommend it if you love all things shellfish! 8/10Lastly, my mother ordered the scallop and crab risotto and this was the star of the table. It was fluffy and full of flavor, the scallops were seared to perfection, and I couldn't help but keep stealing bites! 9/10Overall, Fog Harbor is a super solid seafood spot with good views, great food, and excellent service. Would highly recommend it if you love seafood!</p>
<p>We asked Google where to find the best clam chowder. We were not disappointed. Everything was great.First off, our server "Bong Jovi" was delightful. Very helpful and very attentive. Old school service at a great venue.Everyone was helpful. The restaurant was full, but everyone was attentive. Our used plates were quickly cleared by whoever happened to walk by. Even the manager stopped by to ask how our meal was, and HE took a plate.We started with crab cakes (amazing) and blue cheese bread (delicious).Claim chowder was the best we've ever had. It had the texture of mashed potatoes,  and the most amazing tastes.Half an order of fresh oysters were delicious, and a lobster roll too. Sadly we left no room for dessert, but we did see the dessert tray and it looked good enough to come back just for dessert. There are a lot of restaurants on the Pier. This is one you should not miss.</p>
<p>This is a must-visit for seafood lovers. Their Cioppino is packed with a variety of fresh seafood in a flavorful tomato broth. The Blue Cheese Garlic Bread is a delicious appetizer, and the Mussel Fries are a unique and tasty dish. Don't miss their Award Winning Clam Chowder served in a sourdough bread bowl. The Fish & Chips are crispy and satisfying. Overall, the food is delicious, the service is attentive, and the atmosphere is pleasant. Highly recommended.Ambiance - 5 StarsService - 5 StarsFood - 5 Stars</p>
<p>I took family here while we were sightseeing in San Francisco.  I was excited seeing this is one of the top reviewed restaurants in Fisherman's Wharf and was able to get last minute reservations.  We arrived early but the hostess was able to seat us which was great because the restaurant was packed already and there were groups of people waiting to get in outside.  They guided us to our table, past the gorgeous floor to ceiling windows in front of the water and saw many people with full unobstructed views.  We were so disappointed to find out that they had a separate back room cramped with many small tables and situated in such a way that only half the guests had views of the window.  It doesn't seem fair however they decide which parties get to sit in the main dining room vs the back room.  The food was OK, the clam chowder is supposedly award winning but it was very average to me.  I had the mussel fries which needed much more broth and garlic aioli on top of the fries.  I guess if I ever came back I would make sure to call ahead and get a table in front of the windows so everyone can enjoy.</p>
<p>Amazing food and great service. Scallop and crab risotto is to die for. Our server Bong Jovi was super nice. Highly recommended!!!!</p>
<p>When I see claims of "the best" or  "world famous", I can't help but try out the thing to see if it is indeed, the best. Fog Harbor Fish House has been awarded the Best Seafood Restaurant in San Francisco and has award-winning Clam chowder. Being the best in San Fran is a bold claim, so I made it a point to stop here while exploring Pier 39. In case you're ever looking for this place, know that it is on the second floor, so you need to go upstairs to get the front door. I made a reservation through Yelp a couple days in advance for a table for 1 for lunch. My reservation was honored and I was seated right away. The view from my table by the window was great; it overlooked the pier and I had a good time watching sea lions play and swim as further out tour ships arrived and left. On to the food. I ordered just one thing - a cup of clam chowder. There is an option to add crab meat, but I decided against it (hint: add the crab for a tastier soup). With no modifications, the clam chowder was pretty tasty. It was hot and I enjoyed eating it alongside the complementary bread and butter. Would it win my award for best chowder... the verdict is still out because it's the first clam chowder I've ever had haha. I can say I would like more clam in the soup and that adding crab would have made a big difference. Seeing as I could have had another bowl... or two, I can concede that it's a darn good clam chowder. If I hadn't had a plane to catch, I would also try the Crab Cakes and the Seared Scallop & Crab Risotto. Next time!</p>
<p>We decided to have lunch at Fog Harbor Fish House. Upon arrival, we were seated within just 5 minutes. The restaurant's ambiance was delightful, even though it was crowded. Our server, Nick, was both friendly and helpful, guiding us in making our meal choices. We went with his recommendations and ordered the crab cakes, clam chowder, salmon, and shellfish platter. The food was great and worth the hype.</p>
<p>Lokma is a gem:  a lovely venue; a perfect staff proud of what they serve and efficient and friendly; and well-prepared and well-portioned food.I started my meal with lamb kofta that was charred and accompanied by a chickpea salad that was nicely astringent.A main course of halibut, mashed potatoes and chickpea salad was worthy of all the positive adjectives.  The fish was perfectly cooked and flaked at the touch of my fork.  Halibut can be difficult to cook as it dries out easily.  Not this halibut; it was pearly white, fresh, and not fishy in the least.  The potatoes and chickpea salad completed a well thought out plate of food.I certainly will become a regular at Lokma.</p>
<p>Turkish cuisine with a Californian twist. Everything I ordered was fresh and flavorful. Great for brunch but on this occasion went for dinner. The atmosphere was cozy and warm. The service was attentive. Fairly priced. My favorites were the dumplings, the eggplant with beef, and the pita with clotted cream and honey. The pita was so warm and fresh. Definitely will go back again. Neighborhood gem!</p>
<p>This Turkish spot is 5/5. Everything was perfect! The ambiance was perfect, service was helpful and kind and the food was to die for!! A few of our favorites were Manti, grilled chicken plate and THE SHORT RIB!! Wow! The Bal & Malyak was such a good combo of sweet cream with the other dishes. Everything was so flavorful and filling!!</p>
<p>From the moment I stepped into Lokma, I knew I was in for a treat. The ambiance of this cozy spot in San Francisco is both inviting and intimate, perfect for a memorable dining experience. The staff welcomed us warmly, setting the stage for what was an exceptional culinary journey.The menu, a delightful fusion of traditional and contemporary flavors, left us spoilt for choice. We started with the meze platter, a colorful array of dips and bread that was both fresh and flavorful. For the main course, the lamb shank was a standout, cooked to perfection and melting in the mouth, paired exquisitely with aromatic rice.But what truly took my breath away was the Lokma dessert - little bites of heaven that were the perfect end to our meal. Soft, sweet, and just the right amount of crispy, they were an absolute delight.To top it off, the Turkish tea and coffee offered an authentic touch that transported us straight to the streets of Istanbul. The attentive service, coupled with the high-quality, fresh ingredients used in every dish, made our dining experience at Lokma not just a meal, but a memorable event.For anyone seeking a culinary adventure in San Francisco, Lokma is a must-visit. It's not just a meal, it's an experience that tantalizes the taste buds and warms the heart. Five stars all the way!</p>
<p>After spending a portion of my summer in Istanbul, I was excited to reconnect with some Turkish cuisine. I'd have to say that the dishes at Lokma leaned more towards Mediterranean and California influences than the dinners I enjoyed while I was in Turkey. In terms of the service -  while our waitress seemed friendly I think she was somewhere else bc. She needed to be a little more attentive to our table. We ordered 4 dishes - The Braised Short Ribs, Manti which had too much garlic sauce, Calamari and a Beet Salad. They have outdoor dining and a brunch menu... if you go please let me know what you think!!</p>
<p>The elusive lokma! We've always had trouble actually getting a seat here because they're always so busy. We also really wanted to try the brunch menu as it has been highly recommended by many friends. So finally we sat for brunch one weekend and it did not disappoint. The Turkish breakfast was perfect to share and deliciously fresh . Would love to go back for a special dinner service.</p>
<p>- really gorgeous interior with outdoor seating as well- service was pretty prompt- turkish breakfast for two (5/5): well balanced meal with lots of different sides to eat with the fluffy pita and keep the meal interesting. the kaymak and honey paired soo well together! if you're a big eater though it may not leave you full, we left at a good level- cute place for brunch or lunch, would come back again!</p>
<p>The ambiance was appealing and comfortable. We came for early dinner on a Sunday. The service was attentive at times, itbut not necessarily friendly or welcoming.We ordered two entrees  and several smaller plates:Chicken entree 2/5 the rice was good, would not order again.Veggie Couscous Entree 4/5 other guest enjoyed Trio of spreads 4/5 yummy, great pita. Shishito peppers 2/5, too much yogurt garnish took over the dish. Brussel Sprouts 4/5, simple but good; would order without the cured meat next time. Grilled Veggies 5/5. Delicious! Swiss Chard 2/5, good but again there so much yogurt garnish. Was half chard and half yogurt. Patata Bravas 5/5. Really Good. Was not going to order, ended up being one of my favs. Presidio Salad-cannot rate we over ordered...Overall the food was good. Next time would go for the branzino or short ribs.  Brunch looks fun.</p>
<p>This place was so yummy! The service was very attentive and the food came out so quick. EVERYTHING we ate was so good!! The portions were huge and everything was plated so nicely. I will definitely be coming back!</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed this Mediterranean spot. We got the Turkish breakfast for 2 which was delicious! I didn't feel overstuffed and between my boyfriend and I, we had plenty to eat. We also got two Turkish coffees.We sat outside in the parklet, which was lovely. Maybe a lil chilly but a good jacket and you're solid.Would go again an def starting to tell others about it!</p>
<p>No Fees</p>
<p>I had a great night with my friends at this place last week. They have delicious authentic Turkish food.I'll be back soon!</p>
<p>3.5 star experience for us for breakfastI liked that that it was a relatively healthy option-ed breakfast and there was no wait. The indoor seating is a little crammed, but otherwise cute. They have outdoor seating as well. Service was pretty good. We had the Menemen which was scrambled eggs and tomatoes and sweet peppers, drizzled with feta. Personally I loved it since it reminded me of one of my favorite chinese dishes of tomato with egg. It comes with thin pita bread that are perfect for dipping. The avocado toast was a little pathetic. It came on two teeny tiny slices of bread, that the kind of sliced bread you might put on a cheese platter. I didn't even have time to take a picture since it was gone in two bites.</p>
<p>We ordered the manti, baba ganoush with pita, flan and revani. Pros: - Such a cute spot - I particularly love the outdoor seating and they had blankets and heaters for cooler nights - Very good customer service - We saw a lot of people ordering the revani for dessert and it was really good! The cream and strawberries were very complimentary to the cake Cons: - none! I look forward to coming back to try the Turkish brunch!</p>
<p>Turkish breakfast for two is a must! I love everything in the spread that includes sweet and savory dips, olives, feta cheese, walnuts, fresh cucumber tomato salad. It also includes a satisfying dish of scrambled eggs with sausages and pita bread. The Turkish breakfast is plenty of food for two people.  We've indulged in a side of Greek yogurt pancakes which leaves us more than full yet it's hard to resist! The pancakes are the perfect consistency with just a touch of sweetness. They do get busy on weekends so I recommend checking the Yelp waitlist. Often times we'd be seated even while still on the waitlist.</p>
<p>My friend and I were really hungry after doing a run! I bookmarked this place so we decided to try this for brunch. I really like how you can join the waitlist on Yelp before you head over so you're not waiting outside. Parking is horrible in the area; so by the time we found parking and then walked over, our table was pretty much ready. Their Greek Yogurt Pancakes looked good and I wanted something sweet and savory, so I decided to order the Sunrise Combo which came with the pancakes and also scrambled eggs with Turkish sausage. The pancakes were so light and fluffy and I enjoyed the blueberry compote that was on it. Also the eggs were cooked perfectly and the Turkish sausage was tasty too. Really liked this place and would come back again! I want to try their Turkish breakfast for two.</p>
<p>This is my first time having turlu omelette! The ratatouille is well-seasoned, and the omelette is cooked just right to be tender. The Greek yogurt pancake is also unique. It's slightly tart and of a firmer texture than regular pancakes. The mushroom soup is solid, but I wish it can be thicker and creamier. The service and ambiance are really nice. The waitress was attentive to me despite that she was busy in a full restaurant. The interior is cute and slightly hippy with all the brunch goers. Overall, a great Turkish brunch experience!!</p>
<p>My cousin booked Lokma for a graduation dinner for a party of 14 and it was a great intimate location for a party of this size. We got seated along the wall with booth seating which felt a little further away from other tables. Since this was such a large group, we had a set pre fixe menu with everything served family style. For starters we  had the trio of dips, papas bravas, citrus salad, and calamari and couscous. Entrees included the grilled chicken with saffron rice and tzatziki, short ribs with carrots and mashed potatoes, and halibut with couscous and mashed potatoes. Dessert was the clotted cream with honey and baklava. Everything was timed really well and came out in rounds for the entire table. All the starters that we got were really really good. The pita and dips were delicious and not too heavy. The potatoes were out of this world! Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, creamy house sauce, and topped with olives and feta. The citrus salad had citrus, beets, and arugula in a light vinegarette which was really good and everything tasted fresh. The calamari and couscous was in a tomato sauce and everything was cooked perfectly tender. The entrees were all a bit overcooked, with the grilled chicken being the best item out of the three. I think by this time in the meal everyone was pretty full, so we took most of the entrees for leftovers. The desserts were delicious as expected, the clotted cream and honey was my favorite even with how sweet it was. I really liked the service and small, intimate feel of the restaurant. The servers were very cognizant of the allergies we listed and even brought out different plates of food for those with nut allergies. Overall, it was a great meal but I think I might prefer Lokma brunch over their dinner!</p>
<p>Lokma has been on my list for a while and finally got the chance to try it. We came for an early dinner and were seated outside in the parklet. Order:-Spreads sampler (Muhammara, Baba Ganoush, Tzatziki & warm pita): Great sampler to try everything. The pita was warm and fulffy. The tzatziki was refreshing against the baba ganoush and muhammara. Lovely smoky flavor on the baba ganoush.-Manti: My favorite to eat. Each dumpling is small and has a fun texture. The sauce was creamy and smooth. Flavor was well-rounded overall-Karniyarik (stuffed eggplant): Go for this if you like eggplant. Well presented and had good flavor. The saffron rice was cooked well. The tzatziki pared well with the entire dish.-Lokma burger: As a person who doesn't like lamb, I actually liked this beef and lamb combo. There's little to no gaminess. The bun was well toasted and the potatoes were crispy.Great experience. Would come back again.</p>
<p>We signed up for the yelp list as we grabbed a parking spot down the street. The wait list lets you indicate if you have indoor or outdoor dining preference or either. We had our dog so opted for outdoor seating. I appreciate that they are dog friendly! Street parking is metered so remember to set a timer! Then I checked in with the host and our wait time was about 25min for 4ppl for lunch on a Saturday.We were seated at a handicap table initially as that was the first open table. But then were asked to move to another table as a wheelchair user needed those tables. No problem, but be aware that they don't have much handicap seating if you need it.My boyfriend and I shared the traditional Turkish breakfast for two and a papas bravas. Our friends enjoyed the sunrise combo, Lokma burger, and bal&kaymak.The Turkish breakfast was delightful! It was a good amount of food for two hungry eaters. We did run out of pita bread before we finished all the sides, but it was fine to just eat it by the forkful. Our favorites were the muhammara and the hazelnut spread.Our friends enjoyed their food and let us know it was one of their favorite brunch places in the neighborhood, they have been several times and are in their way to trying everything on the menu!</p>
<p>This is a great brunch spot if you're looking for tasty food but also want some lighter options, as well as Turkish cuisine!We got the traditional Turkish breakfast, which serves two. It was very very tasty, and had more than enough food for two of us. I really like how it came with a mix of sweet and savory sides, since I can never decide for brunch! I especially liked the hazelnut spread, clotted cream with honey, and hummus.If you're looking for brunch, I'd recommend getting the Turkish breakfast for 2 here! It came with a variety of things to try, and is a pretty good value.</p>
<p>No Fees</p>
<p>I had an absolutely delightful experience at this restaurant . From the moment I walked in, the ambiance set the stage for a perfect evening. The service was impeccable--attentive, friendly, and prompt, elevating the whole dining experience to a new level. Now, let's talk about the food. Each dish was a culinary masterpiece, full of flavor and beautifully presented. The chef has a genuine talent for balancing traditional and modern flavors, making each bite a revelation. I would highly recommend this to anyone seeking exceptional food and stellar service. Can't wait to return!</p>
<p>NEW FAVE ALERT Like this has gotta be in my top 3 restaurants in SF. It's like they took all my favorite foods and put them on every dish lol. Kc and I got:Nono toast (w/ marinated jidori yolk, uni, caviar, black pepper, + fresh truffle shaves) SO good Chawan Mushi (w/ shrimp, truffle nameko mushroom, uni, + ikura) I've loved chawan mushi ever since I was a kid and this is one of the best I've ever had!! It's comparable to ones we've had in set menu meals / omakase. Chips + Dip (nori chips w/ creme fraiche, hokkaido uni, negitoro, caviar, fresh wasabi) really yummy!!Chicken tail + unagi head skewers!! Chicken tail is my fave part of the chicken to have for yakitori, and we'd never tried unagi heads before this so we were really excited about that  I really liked the flavor--it tastes like fish head/eye lol but the tiny bones make it pretty hard to eat, kinda like chicken feet Bacon-wrapped mochi skewerHotate + amaebi sashimi Overall !! Def need to find someone to go back here with  I think they change up their menu pretty regularly!</p>
<p>Obsessed with this place! A hidden gem and a great dinner option in Japantown. Interior is cozy, intimate, and to me most ideal for parties of 2-4. Staff are welcoming and attentive, plus food came quick. Below is a list of what we ordered. I honestly enjoyed them all. Fish is fresh, robata meat is tender, and dishes are well seasoned.- Chips and dip- Pork belly robata (HIGHLY RECOMMEND)- Beef ribeye cap robata (HIGHLY RECOMMEND)- Chicken garlic nankotsu robata- Chicken wing robata (HIGHLY RECOMMEND)- Kaisen don (HIGHLY RECOMMEND)- Mushroom tempura- Uji matcha white strawberry drink (delicious but a heavy drink that felt more like a dessert)- Yuzu lemonade (refreshing and a great accompaniment to the meal)I'm still dreaming about the food from that night. Can't wait to return!</p>
<p>A hidden gem in japantown, you could walk by it and hardly notice it. Which is what Is what I did when I met my friend for dinner. There's no obvious signage just a lantern and some benches on the outside. We are super early at 5, so there wasn't a line and not a whole lot of people inside. The interior is modern with lots of wood accents. The menu is pretty large but has a good selection of izakaya foods. We started off with the maitake mushroom tempura which was so crispy and delicious, it wasn't too heavy or greasy for the batter. We also got the beef tongue , chicken negi & chicken heart skewers. They were all seasoned pretty well and not overly cooked. We got a kaisen don which was actually a pretty decent size to share and had fresh scallops, shrimp, uni , salmon and tuna on top. Definitely on the pricier side but it was pretty good. Would definitely come back here in the future! Total for 2: $130</p>
<p>They finally got their liquor license (unfortunately), so that means no more BYOB (uber unfortunate, tragic news)--but thank goodness their food still slays. I think they've moved their late night HH to after 10pm now, or maybe it depends on the day? Not too sure about this. But my partner and I arrived a couple min before HH started (officially) and they were very kind to seat us out of the outside winter cold and let us place our orders a min before HH menu officially started. I love the vibes and how loud and boisterous it is inside!</p>
<p>Small casual skewer Japanese shop - it's comforting but doesn't take you by surprise. Top 2 favorites are probably the Kaisen Don and Chips and Dip. The wasabi that came with the chip and dip is crazy good. The melon ice cream was hype but honestly underwhelming - I could just get a melon and melona mix together. Service was a bit slow but they had limited staff so I don't blame them.</p>
<p>Continuing with our streak of trying out new restaurants in the city, we stopped by Nono on a Saturday to see what all the hype was about.Ambiance - Relatively small restaurant with maybe enough tables for 5-6 groups inside. Typical small izakaya feel to the space. It was a little smokey inside from all the charcoal grilling. Service - All the staff were very attentive and orders were coming out relatively quickly. It did take a while to get all of our skewers (lost count because they were coming out at different times), but it wasn't too long to be bothered.Food - I'd have to say that the food was pretty good at Nono. Very flavorful and also aesthetically pleasing. My favorites were the chicken namban, the chips and dip, and the happy melon. The yakitori was pretty good too even though I generally don't like skewers. Nono is a great addition to the Filmore/Japantown area. It has different enough offerings to the other Japanese restaurants in the area that I think it will probably be our go-to for Japanese small bites.One recommendation for the restaurant though is they really need to reorganize their menu. It was a hard to read and I wasn't completely sure what we were ordering based on the descriptions for each item.</p>
<p>Nono is a delightful gem tucked away in the heart of Japantown. This small izakaya restaurant left a lasting impression on our dining experience.My daughter was so smitten with the gyoza that she insisted on ordering it again - a true testament to its delectable taste. And the yakitori? It was nothing short of amazing. The chicken and steak skewers were amazing! The lamb rack stole the show.Nono's flavors left us craving for more, and it's safe to say that I'm definitely coming here on every trip to San Francisco. Say "yes, yes to Nono!"</p>
<p>I came here with a friend on a particularly hot summer night for the 9pm happy hour and we agreed this place was great! We each ordered a few happy hour items, me a few chicken skewers and an uni hand roll. The portions were on the smaller size, especially the hand roll, but I couldn't complain with HH prices. The quality was all around excellent and our server was friendly and present. Because it was so warm, every table that night was offered a sorbet on the house near closing time. Such a sweet gesture!</p>
<p>MUST TRY!! 10/10 so happy my parents brought me here for my birthday dinner. We came right when they opened at 5pm and was able to get seated right away. We ordered everything on the happy hour menu :) The restaurant is super small so there is almost always a wait so be sure to come early! Sushi was fresh, skewers were perfectly grilled, and I loved every single bite! Will definitely be back esp with their $5 hot sake</p>

<p>Otra takes classic Mexican flavors and adds its own touch to create some really interesting dishes. They have mushroom tacos that have such a great flavor that even meat eaters would want over other options. I usually get the fish tacos which come very crispy and juicy. Their servings are medium sized but I tend to leave pretty full.</p>
<p>Restaurant had a good ambiance for date night. The service was good but they seemed understaffed.The food is okay, the beef tacos and sweet potatoes tacos were good. The fish tacos made me sick</p>
<p>The restaurant has nice setting, and they have great selection of food. Been here many times and I can say that the food has an excellent quality. So many great variety of flavors. The tacos were all appetizing and it was well-prepared, it has lots of veggies and it so meaty!The place was cool, and its better to get reservation. Nice seating and it has pleasant ambiance. Great customer service.</p>
<p>The food here is innovative but maybe too innovative. You can't order a nice Dos Equis or a side of refritos. They just don't have it. The prices are a little too high for what it is. The service is good. The varnita tacos are good, the ingredients are fresh. But it's so dark in the restaurant you can't see the vibrant colors of fresh Mexican food! I love dark, quiet & cozy restaurants but this is not cozy or quiet. Just dark. We eat with our eyes first I'm told, but you can't see anything on your plate here. The house margarita was okay--very light pour, couldn't taste any tequila. It's a nice place with good food. Just not my kind of place.</p>
<p>Came here on a Saturday with no reservation and got seated immediately! Good:- Charred lettuce was amazing! What a cool dish, it had cool texture too.- The mushroom tacos were surprisingly good and flavorful! - nice dimly lit place great for catch-ups- Food came fast Bad:- I thought the cod tostada had very little flavor and was expensive so not worth Overall worth trying out!</p>
<p>This place is right next to Danny Coyle's where I come in for morning soccer games over weekends and I finally gave into the temptation to try Otra as I was heading out on a Saturday afternoon.Amazing mushroom tacos! Loaded with mushrooms. The huge variety of fillings in the taxi gave it such an amazing flavor. It is sorta spicy in itself, but if you're a spice lover, ask them for their spicy sauce on the side. It makes it even better. I'd definitely rate this dish 5/5. The only downer for me was that there were only two tacos for $14, and that seemed a tad pricy despite the inflation, the location in SF, and the quality of the food. I wish there was one more taco. Maybe it's the right price and I probably didn't get the right feel of the ambiance since I came in at 11:30 AM by myself. The restaurant was fairly empty and there were less than 5 people. The lady who took my order was very friendly! I was confused if I should get another plate of tacos (sweet potato) but I didn't want to spend over $30 for a brunch meal by myself. I will definitely be back once again after another soccer game, because I want to try some of their other dishes. I rate the place 4.5/5, but I couldn't round off to 5 because of the portions for a $20 meal with tip. :(</p>
<p>Drinkies: Jalisco 75-LOVED ITHouse margarita spicy with tequila- GREAT! Appz: Aguachile -the fish they used was super tender. It had a nice spice that creeps up on you-but could use a little more spice and flavor (just my opinion). The chips they used were great (crispy/salted). Dinner:Beef taco: pretty delicious! Would be better if they doubled the tortilla since there was a lot on one. But the beef was tender and flavorful. Recommend this one! Concha's borrachas: DO NOT RECOMMEND. Had a very fishy sus taste. We only ate a couple bites and just didn't trust it. The chorizo didn't have flavor. Ambiance is cute and romantic! Service overall was good- a little on the slower side. Clean and the decore is cute!</p>
<p>A little loud, but the food is delicious. The waitstaff is very nice and does a great job. Can't wait to go back</p>
<p>Finally got to try Otra! We walk by it all the time and I guess the San Diegan in me was hesitant to try this and be severely disappointed (bc we're taco snobs). And I gotta say, my partner and I were pleasantly impressed. It's good for what it is, this isn't your homestyle/street food type mexican food. This is your "fancy resort in mexico type" and for that, it is good. Especially paired with their well made cocktails, thats a win. In terms of food, I recommend the beef tacos. Its not dry and has lots of flavors, ask for their habanero hot sauce if you wanna kick it up a notch. Their al pastor tacos were fine, it didn't have the classic red char but it wasn't bad. Drinks are dangerously good though, if you like mezcal, this is the place to try it. I liked my Paloma and my partner enjoyed his old fashion (i forget the actual name).</p>
<p>This place was very good! Not like mind blowingly good or anything like that, but a solid Mexican brunch place. Came here today with my sister and brother in law, and their pup Bailey. They have outdoor seating and it wasn't cold out (rarity in SF this winter) so it worked out perfectly. We got some chips and salsa, and I got the beef hash. My sister got the beef tacos and my brother in law got the pozole. The chips and salsa were great - only thing that could have made them better was warm chips but who cares. The salsa was certainly house made, very good kick, and surprisingly the salsa verde was a bit hotter than the rojo. My hash was nothing to write home about honestly but what can you expect, its potato, veggies and cut up beef. I guess the beef just wasn't that flavorful (didn't seem to have really any Mexican flavor to it - cumin, etc.), or tender. But it was still a solid dish. The eggs were perfectly poached with a nice orange yolk. I also tried the beef tacos and those were yummy, though my sister thought they were spicy. Brother in law loved his pozole. Will probably be back again because it is close by, wasn't busy and the service was good!</p>

<p>Great spot for a nice, tasty dinner. Lots of veggie options. The two of us split the beans+chips, ensalada, and mushroom tacos. The beans+chipswas a little salty and the chips themselves weren't amazing. The ensalada was really really delicious and herby. The tacos were by far the star of the show! It was a spicy, umami bomb! They were pretty tiny tacos though, I don't think two tacos alone would have filled me up. We also each got a cocktail--tasty and strong. Service was just okay! Overall definitely recommend this place for a nice dinner out!</p>
<p>Located in Lower Haight, this tapas restaurant offers a delightful dining experience. During my visit with a friend, we sampled the beef tacos, al pastor pork, and totopos with salsas. While all the dishes were enjoyable, the beef tacos stood out with their excellent sauce, tender beef, and a harmonious blend of flavors. They were so good that we ended up ordering seconds! The Al Pastor, though slightly chewier than expected, still offered a flavorful taste, especially when paired with the diverse and flavorful salsas that accompanied the chips. The margaritas were refreshing, striking a perfect balance between sourness and sweetness, and the option to share a pitcher was a welcomed feature. Overall, this is one of the top Latin spots in the area, and I highly recommend it to those in the vicinity or nearby residents.</p>
<p>Amazing little spot! The food is amazing. We had the frijolitos for an appetizer which was terrific. We are salsa and chips people but you have to try the frijolitos they are game changers. The beef and quesabirria tacos were both killer, but to our surprise the sweet potato tacos stole the show. This restaurant is a gem and even more so if you are vegetarian or gluten free. The marg's are no joke too. Make sure you stop here!</p>
<p>Very tasty, but also very salty, especially the mussels that we got. With the chorizo, it would've been nice to have it a bit less salty. Enjoyed the two salsas that came with the totopos and salsa appetizer--both were complex and mouth warming. The mushroom tacos were full of umami and well-balanced, though on the mushy side if you care about textures. Everything tasted fresh and made with quality ingredients. The drinks were solid and positively cheap at $12 a pop. Service was great, and the vibe inside was great for a casual-ish date. Did this place stand out among the many great Mexican/taco places in the city? Not really. But I didn't try their meat tacos, so maybe that would've made the difference!</p>
<p>My friend and I started off with the aguachile. If you like raw fish preparations, this is the dish for you. It was citrusy, flavorful, and VERY spicy. In our case, this was a positive but mind the spice if you're not as big of a fan. It was just the perfect thing to wake our palettes up. Also as a bonus, the portion size was bigger than I expected. For entree, we  shared the mushroom tacos and beef tacos which were a great compliment to each other. The mushroom tacos were also a bit spicy but you can ask for them without the chili flakes on top which would moderate the heat. All the dishes were super savory and delicious. The service was excellent and our waitress spent time with us walking through some dishes that would be perfect for the level of appetite we were at. I look forward to coming back with an even bigger group because the tapas format lends itself really well to sharing.</p>
<p>Excellent foodGreat ambiance Very unique dinner that truly surprised and delighted us</p>
<p>Good food, service and beers.  I love the ambiance, the place is cute and really good for catching up with friends. We were hungry after getting a few drinks and my friend suggested to try it. We ordered the meatballs, aguachilles and the spicy broccoli and we loved all of them.</p>
<p>Love this place especially for vegetarian or vegans! Lots of options for us. They have mushroom, squash, and bean tacos and all of them are well curated and delicious. The drinks are delicious and unique. Everything we tried was amazing. Service was very friendly and the ambiance was casual while still being very nicely decorated. I loved it since it was perfect for all kinds of scenarios!</p>
<p>Wow! Otra is a wonderful spot for food in the Lower Haight. The decor of the restaurant is consistent and a fun mixing of textures all in shades of blue. At night it is cozy.In terms of the food, they do vegetables here very very well. The charred cabbage and roasted Brussel sprouts were flavorful. Each bite has the right balances of umami, salt, acid, and heat. The cod tostada was skillfully executed to preserve the fish (without going dry), keep a crunch on the tostada, yet round out the flavor profile.I had a margarita that evening and it had acidity that was delightful. It also was not heavy handed with the tequila and was balanced well. The service here is attentive without being pushy or overbearing. I thought they handed our party of seven well, and we never felt like there was a significant gap for plates to come out. Overall, I will be back!</p>
<p>Stopped by just for a drink & the cucumber cocktail was spot on as well as my michelada, we had already ate or else we would've ordered some food. The menu looked really good & the food smelled delicious. Will definitely be back to try the food!</p>
<p>Saw that this place had been opened for a while and I finally got around to trying it. Once I got there, the lady (boss? i think) was super nice saying to just put my name down on the waitlist and said it would take about 15 minutes. We (party of 4) got seated and the lady (same one) said to us very enthusiastically "ITS COLD. I'LL GIVE YOU SOME MILK TEA." She proceeded to ask us what flavors we would like, sugar preference, even asked us if we wanted pudding or lychee jelly. We all went along with her and gave her our preferences, thinking all of this was on the house. I guess it's also our fault that we didn't clarify but it turned out to not be free. I just wished she would have told us that it would cost money. We all ended up spending $24 on drinks that we wouldn't have ordered if it wasn't on the house. Other than that, the food was good. I got the sichuan beef flavor that's 3 fire signs but tasted like 1 fire sign. Kinda gross tho because one of my friend had a piece hair that's not from the head in one of their side dishes. Aight TLDR- don't get scammed when they say lemme make you some milk tea and double check if it's free or nah. ngl the milk tea is good but not good bc i feel scammed. ya knur?? food was good.</p>
<p>Noodles are my obsession -- so when Oodle opened up, I knew I had to go.The spicy sichuan noodles did not disappoint. Portion size was great, the soup was flavorful, and the juice drinks were great too! (this is coming from a guy who almost always gets beer with his noodles).The staff were friendly and easy to talk to. Food came out quickly. The store was clean and cozy. I'll definitely be coming again. (Their menu tastes great to-go as well, which is a hard thing to achieve for noodles!)</p>
<p>AMAZING!!! I am so glad that I've found this place!  Came here on a Saturday afternoon around 2pm and was seated quickly.  Owner was friendly and offered some tea. We wanted noodles and knew that we would be too full if we drink tea.  There are many soup options..I ended up selecting spicy pot.  It was delicious!! The broth was deep and rich without any heaviness.  I love display of side dishes and vegetables.It's a small restaurant- clean, cute and very casual.  Service is very good and friendly. I cannot wait to come back!</p>
<p>A new place on the block! Definitely popular. To break it down it's a cute, 6 tables, clean, quick service and warm family run restaurant. Menu is limited but has something for everyone. Big value for money!So the concept is similar to hotpot but it's just real hot soup with sides and noodle (deconstructed noodle soup)The most spicy soup on the menu was flavorful, not too spicy. All ingredients felt fresh and well served. I was going to order chicken soup which is creamy and non spicy but I opted for pickled pork soup instead which I definitely think was a better option. We ordered Popcorn chicken, garlic fries, lychee smoothie with cream(highly recommend) and pandan milk tea (least fav order) and the total came up to $55 + TaxIf you're looking for fresh, healthy meal you should visit!Thank you for the warm service. See you'll!</p>
<p>tldr; this is a new restaurant in the richmond! come here if you're craving delicious, piping hot rice noodle souprecs: popcorn chicken, green pepper noodle soup with fish fillet (if you enjoy mala flavors)Oodle is a beautifully decorated rice noodle restaurant new to the Richmond community as of the end of October. The bridge with ten different side dishes to add to your noodle soup is one of its unique qualities and made my dining experience here super entertaining. For ~$25/pp, my friend and I left this restaurant positively stuffed with popcorn chicken to go. As someone who constantly craves mala flavors, I loved the green pepper soup. The broth was also scalding which makes it a great dine-in experience and a perfect option for rainy days in the Richmond. Tip: try the chili oil at the table with the fish fillets -- it's super tasty!Service was super attentive. Someone who looked like the owner was going around making sure guests were happy with the food. We got our waters refilled several times. My friend and I are already thinking of our next trip back here when the cold weather returns to SF. :)</p>
<p>Located just nearby Devil's Teeth is Balboa St's new noodle place! It's quite small inside with about 20 people seating so if it's busy.... it'll be a wait!We came on a Saturday during lunch with 3 groups ahead of us and we waited for about 15 minutes for table of 2. Service was prompt and engaging throughout the entire meal! I ordered the sichuan spicy broth with beef. The components of the soup are presented on a bridge which I thought was super cute! The beef and noodles are all served separately, so YOU are in control of what and how much goes into your soup. The beef was yum and I thought a lot of the side add in's were just ok. The sichuan broth was kinda sichuan-y but not really spicy so it wasn't really up to my expectations of a sichuan spicy broth.Worth checking out in the area!</p>
<p>Small little rice noodle house! It's ran by a lovely couple and they're are so nice. The restaurant is relatively small with a limited number of seats. Arrived around 7pm for a party of 5 on a Sat and luckily a large party happened to be leaving.I ordered the Yunnan Spicy Small Pot Rice Noodles and it was perfect for the cold weather! Mild-Medium spicy and since it was served in a pot, the soup stayed hot for a long time. Once they serve the soup, dump the noodles and small dishes in. Also had the popcorn chicken, cucumber and cold tofu (forgot to take pic). My favorite was the cucumber since it was very flavorful and the peanuts added a nice crunch!Service was attentive and the owner came to check in with us multiple times. Highly recommend!</p>
<p>A small place that delivers a big flavor. The fun toppings will show up on your table as soon as you order. The broth comes up super hot, so be careful. According to the owner, the broth has been simmered for over 10 hours with various bones and ham, no MSG added. Be sure to call ahead to reserve your seat.</p>
<p>Came in on a Saturday at 2PM with a party of 3- we ended up waiting 30-40 minutes to be seated as it was busy. There were two benches for us to sit on while we waited. Once we were seated, I ordered the Crossing Bridge rice noodle as I was looking for something more light but filling. Food was solid and I loved the little plates of food on the bridge and how they were presented. Ate the whole bowl swiftly and appreciated how I could customize it with the sides. Although the wait was a bit long, the food came out swiftly and I thoroughly appreciated a good bowl of noodle soup for a rainy day. My friends ordered the tomato beef brisket rice noodles and chicken rice noodles and also enjoyed their meals. My order came out to be $21 including tip.</p>
<p>Walked by and ordered a popcorn chicken because we were craving a quick little snack. I have had it before and it was pretty good. I got it again and this time it was slightly less salty which was lack of flavor. But everything else was good cos it was hot. Wish it had more basil as well. I also had to ask for pepper (they don't have it in the togo option). The boba was decent but was big and didn't finish. I will come back next time but ask for more salt if it isn't salty enough. I haven't tried the noodle soups yet so I will have to!</p>
<p>The interior, presentation and service were all amazing! I think it's really cute that all the noodle sets come with the side dishes on the bridge & the servers/owner were very welcoming and friendly. The price of the noodle sets are around $16-$20 depending on which one you getIn terms of the food the noodles tasted very fresh - they are also quite soft (not really chewy) so good for all ages as well. I think the broth was quite flavorful, rich and aromatic which I appreciated. Popcorn chicken was ok too.I think overall food would be 4/5 but service presentation and pretty interior bumps it up</p>
<p>Ever since I had one of the best crossing the bridge noodles in Brooklyn NY's Chinatown, I've been wanting more. A couple places in the Bay Area sell this noodle dish but all of them left the craving unsatisfied. When I saw an Oodle Yunnan post, I knew I had to grab my husband (the driver) to take me there! He got the #1 original crossing the bridge noodle. One sip of the broth got us both cheesing hard. The owner stopped by to tell us about the homemade broth which is simmered for hours. I got the #7 green pepper fish filet cause im a sucker for anything that's spicy with fish. The broth was out of this world flavorful! The owner told us he has many customers pack leftover broth home to add noodles to. I would've done that... if I didn't drink most of it already. We got an order of their popcorn chicken to share which was perfectly crispy on the outside and steaming hot and juicy on the inside. The fried basil flavor carried over well too. I saw a couple reviews mention the small portion size but I felt it was a perfect amount of food for us. I got pretty full at the end and I have a big appetite! My only complaint is that Oodle Yunnan is out of the way for me! 5 stars!</p>
<p>Came here during their soft opening. We ordered 2 Crossing Bridge Rice Noodles and a popcorn chicken. The Crossing Bridge Rice Noodles dish consisted of an extremely hot bowl of soup with the noodles and meats on the side and the toppings neatly decorated on the bridge. After putting together the dish in this order of meat, noodles, then toppings, the dish tasted super fresh and healthy as everything paired well with the flavorful pork bone and chicken broth. It was quite a refreshing dish. The popcorn chicken is also good. I recommend eating that first before it gets cold as the main dish will remain hot due to the hot bowl it comes in.The staff was super attentive and kept coming back to make sure we were doing well. The waiter politely informed us on how to put together the dish. The waitress asked us how HER soup tasted, so I assumed the soup was her recipe and that she was one of the owners. I overheard that same waitress and waiter, who I assume is the other owner, boast about their Thai tea being the best in the Bay (not sure how true this is since I did not order it), and the waiter even told us about the popcorn chicken.The restaurant itself is kind of small and tight, so this restaurant may not be ideal for bigger parties. Overall though, loved the inside and the vibes of this place, and the food was super good! The man also convinced me to take the rest of my soup home, so I can pair it with whatever noodles at home since it would have been a waste to waste the good soup.</p>
<p>I like the broth, I like the variety of ingredients and the beef quality.   However I cannot give it more than 3 stars if I am still hungry after paying $25.  There is simply not enough protein included.  I would have to pay another $5 plus tax and tip to be satisfied.  I wasn't expecting to pay for more than $30 for yunnan noodles.  It's a good concept just overpriced.</p>
<p>Everything here is so good.they boast the same quality of food. Their decor is more polished though, with sleek seating and cute irregular cloud mirrors along the walls. Parking can be an issue and they also don't take reservations, so plan your visit accordingly. I went with my family of four on a Saturday at 11:30am and were seated immediately, though the line got packed right after, with wait times up to 1.5 hours.Oodle Yunnan Rice Noodle was a very  great and good.I like  their service and also their food.The food was so delicious and  when I will back I will come here. The owners are clearly passionate about the food and the service.The owner is super nice as well.Service was attentive and the owner came to check in with us multiple times. I like it very much. Highly Recommended.Highly Recommended.</p>
<p>We decided to try the new restaurant on Balboa Street called Oodles Yunan Rice Noodles. With such a cute name, how can you go wrong?I had the Chicken Rice Noodles and was impressed! The homemade bone broth was fragrant and delectable!!! The silken rice noodles had an excellent texture and was perfectly Al dente. The shredded chicken, fresh vegetables and accompaniments paired perfectly. I couldn't finish and took the leftover home. Hubby had the Hot and Sour Fish Fillet Rice Noodles. The homemade hot and sour pork bone broth was very tasty and the fish fillet and vegetables were nice and fresh. He thoroughly enjoyed it. His dish disappeared quickly. And he took a lot of my noodles. I also had the Fresh Lemon Bomb Green Tea with Aloe. It was very pleasant. I was worried that the lemon would have a drying after taste but it did not. Hubby had the Thai Me Around (classic Thai milk tea).The service was excellent. All the servers were extremely attentive and cordial. They provide instructions on which order to add the food into the soup. Great customer service!The restaurant is new, clean, organized and inviting. We will definitely return!</p>
<p>Great service, Great drinks, Great slurps Stopped by for brunch and it did not disappoint! The service was very welcoming and attentive. You can tell that they really do value their customer's experience. Our server recommend the popcorn chicken as appetizer and it was on point. Meat was juicy with a crispy mild spicy crunch.I also tried the original crossing bridge rice noodle and it's honestly one of the best I've had. The broth isn't too bland or salty which makes it so appetizing to crave more. The owner also told me that they used to open a boba shop! I tried 2 of their fruit teas and they're both very refreshing and pairs perfect with steaming hot noodles. Overall, a great little spot for authentic Yunnan rice noodles!!</p>
<p>Such a delicious noodle soup place with friendly service! We walked in Thursday evening for dinner and had a fairly short wait while taunted by the delicious smells from all the simmering bowls of soup. The space is warm and inviting with cute tables and decor. I got the Crossing Bridge rice noodles and my friend got the Yunnan spicy small pot rice noodles. It comes deconstructed with all the ingredients on the cutest serving bridge set up and you add everything into the hot steamy soup when it arrives. My bone broth was just amazing -- the manager said they spend 12 hours making it and I believe it! So rich and flavorful. The rice noodles were also just the perfect texture! It was a filling meal and reasonably priced by San Francisco eating out standards. The hot broth was particularly rejuvenating on a foggy cold day but we hear they will be getting Yunnan cold noodles in the future too. As the cherry on top, I was tempted by the drinks selection and tried a delicious Dragonfruit Lychee Smoothie that tastes like it was made in a boutique boba shop. The manager introduced herself to us and checked in during our meal regularly to make sure we were enjoying it. It was so delightful to try this place and I'll certainly come back again!</p>
<p>Nice presentation but expect to be rushed through the whole thing. The original, the mala and the green peppercorn based were pretty good. Expect a wait before you can get a table. Overall though pretty decent yunnan over the bridge noodles.</p>
<p>Great place for a "different " type of meal. Soup served naked and you put in the different ingredients to your liking. Very flavorful broth.  Very nice staff that explains the process to you. For a different place to go, this is the place!</p>
<p>So happy to see another udon place open up! I've heard nothing but good things about this place since it opened and I had to try it for myself.My party of 4 got there around 7pm on a Tuesday and waited in line for about 30 min before getting inside. Once you're inside, you order at the counter before sitting down. There's not a ton of seating and the servers made it very clear where to sit (helpful for making sure everyone is funneled through quickly). The curry sounded delicious on a cold windy day but it was sold out by the time we got there. I opted for the fukuoka signature and it was equally beautiful as it was delicious. Chewy noodles, juicy chicken, and perfectly fried gobo tempura. I tried my friend's mentai udon as well - fresh and fishy (in a good way). Definitely not a flavor I had had before. While I'm not a huge fan of places you have to wait outdoors in line for, I love that this is a casual place where you really go just to enjoy the food.</p>
<p>When I came here on a Monday night, there was a short line outside, but my group got in within 15 minutes. Once we were let in, we were directed to the counter to order. The service was friendly and quick! The inside is nice, but there aren't many tables. I heard that the wait can be long on busier days.The menu has both hot and cold udon options. I saw they even have one vegan option! I ordered the Kakiage udon from the hot section. The udon came with a shrimp tempura and a root vegetable tempura. The noodles were a little thinner than I was expecting. It was all pretty light! Not too greasy and heavy.I thought it was a high quality and tasty meal, but I'm not sure that it would be worth a long wait if I came on the weekend. The cold dishes seem more special, so I might come back to try those!</p>
<p>Oh bummer..! I wanted to like this place. My sister saw this restaurant online many months ago and she urged me to go and try it. I was finally able to make my way over and was there for dinner with some friends last weekend.We were so excited because 1) udon! And 2) there wasn't a line. Two things were already sold out (the curry and another one, I don't remember), but we were able to get a range of "dishes" anyways. I got one of the cold udons with the daikon, another friend got their hot udon with dashi and another their tan tan. Unfortunately both the cold and hot soupy udons were bland in flavor. I quite like light food, my family is Cantonese so we eat a lot of plain steamed food and don't use a lot of seasoning, but this was very subtle and one dimensional.. disappointing. The tan tan was the best, flavor wise. The noodles themselves however, were great! The texture was lovely, but the rest of the dish wasn't able to add anything.</p>
<p>A must-try if you love udon! Their dishes aren't super greasy/heavy, they're relatively affordable (for SF), and offer a decent portion size. I think out of all the udon places in the city, the udon noodles here are my favorite. They're silky smooth and bouncy without being too chewy. Everything here tastes very fresh too! We ordered the Tan Tan, Kakiage, and the Niku udon. Niku Udon: I found it underwhelming because it's seasoned quite lightly. The beef is thinly sliced and lightly salted/seasoned. The gobo tempura was the best part in this bowl though. I've never had gobo deep fried before and it added such an earthy depth to the bowl. Kakiage: The presentation of the fried tempura on top is absolutely beautiful. The broth is light and the Japanese citrus peel in the broth adds a nice freshness. Just a nice classic tempura udon. Tan Tan: This was my favorite! It's spicy, saucy, and extremely savory. The soft egg on top adds such a rich creaminess to the noodles. Definitely a unique udon offering and I think it's worth trying. The dining + ordering style is very casual here. When you walk in, you order and pay at the register. When you sit down, you leave your receipt on the table with the number showing so they can bring your order to you. You can order drinks at the register and there's a water station as well. The cold noodle menu looked very enticing as well. I'm looking forward to coming back when the weather is hot for some refreshing cold noodles! Overall, this is a solid place for a casual meal :)</p>
<p>Quick Summary:- Small interior, so tables fill up quickly- I ordered kake, delicious but light portions for me- Be on the lookout (in this case, hearing) for your number to be callledAs a person, who loves udon, I had to try this restaurant. We went on the day it opened around 4:30pm, and I wanted to go there the moment it opened. From some of the photos I saw on yelp,  there was a line out of the block. We arrived near the vicinity of the restaurant close to its opening time. We seized a spot in line and it looked hopeful, that we were included in the first group to eat.When the time rolled in, the staff came out with the noren (the curtain that symbolizes that the restaurant is ready for operation) was set out, and they gestured us inside. Happily, we were indeed the first group to eat, so we claimed a seat. Each of the tables had a nice little basket underneath to place bags. We wanted to focus on the broth and the noodles, so we chose the kake udon.This was my first visit, so I'm not sure how accurate this is, but the wait time for the order until the food arrived took some time. It could be that we entered the restaurant when it just opened so things were still being cooked and boiled. If I recall, they call for your number, so listen closely to your order.The broth was gentle but flavorful. Perfectly light for what I imagine a udon to be. This was great in the cold weather but since the broth was so light, this might also be good for the hot days.My favorite part of this dish was the noodles. Upon appearance, it was cut evenly and it was glistening. The noodle was cooked to a beautiful transparent sheen. The chewiness was powerfully bouncy, and it was great to slurp it down. The only downside is that because there was a waiting line out the door, I felt a sense of being rushed to eat and leave, but that is not something the staff can improve. If you are feeling like chatting, maybe it's easier to do it while waiting for your order.</p>
<p>Pro-tip: If you want to evade the long line and wait, just order ahead on Toast for pick up! We did this and was able to enjoy udon at home without any fuss. The udon is super well packaged - whether you order hot or cold noodles. It looks like you might even get a bit more tempura in take home orders when comparing to Yelp photos. And everything taste better in PJs at home in my opinion.I personally enjoyed the Fukuoka signature cold udon and it was everything that I look for in cold noodles. Bouncy chewy noodles with perfect crisp gobo tempura. The chicken tempura was especially tasty with a great savory marinade. The broth was deeply flavored and not overwhelmingly fishy like other places I've tried. I don't know if I would say it's worth the wait when other local business in J-Town have very similar caliber of udon. But, it's 100% worth it to try it at least once!</p>
<p>New udon spot that opened on Divisadero! Fresh udon and fast service. Come early, the line gets long! We arrived around 5:30 and my party waited about 15 minutes prior to ordering and being seated. Once we ordered, the food came out within 10 minutes.The Curry -- fresh veggies with beef, onsen egg, and a delicious curry broth. I  really enjoyed all of the veggies present in the dish. It was a little unconventional with all the veggies present, but they all complimented each other and provided a fresh and earthy taste to the dish. There was not much beef itself in the dish, but I was not terribly hungry. The noodles themselves had a softness and chewiness that differentiated Katsuo + Kombu from other restaurants that serve udon in the city.I hope to try some of the cold udon options in the future!</p>
<p>Was told by a friend that this place was something I should try for an udon spot and my ears perked up. A spot on Divis with usually a line, but I just happened to show up at 6pm on a Monday and was able to order at the counter and seat down immediately.FOOD:Niku Beef. Just a classic udon style. Soft flavorful beef, with decently bouncy udon and a sweet, savory and light broth to tie it all together. The hint of fresh tang from the Japanese citrus was possibly my favorite part. Can't go wrong. The Gobo tempura was possibly one of the better parts as the tempura itself is quite good and the flavors just balanced so well with the soup. Definitely worth trying.Tan Tan Dry. Definitely wasn't expecting this but had a saucy spicy flavor which was pretty good. A little salty, but overall the mix of textures and flavors just gives their menu a different aspect, so it has it's place, but I don't have to have this again - worth a try, but not really what I go to udon spots for.Mentai Yamakake Bukkake. Cool, refreshing and clean. The flavors work pretty well with the saltiness of the broth. The minced shiso leaves hidden in the green onions do wonders for the dish. All mixed with a little bit of citrus makes the flavor profile one to get when you're feeling hot. The texture with the sliminess may not be for everyone though.Shrimp Tempura. Got this as a side because I just wanted to get more things. Honestly probably one of the best things on the menu. Fresh shrimp cooked to perfection with a light, flavorful and crunchy batter. Possibly perfection.Overall a solid spot worth trying. Udon itself has the bouncy feel with the unevenness that you can only get when you hand make them which is oh so good. Extremely friendly staff that is accommodating. Just the price is a little high for the portions, but overall definitely worth trying as the flavors are pretty solid.</p>
<p>It gets the job done if you're looking for a chill bowl of udon - something light but substantial, maybe some warm soup for the impending cold - but I wouldn't wait more than maybe 30 minutes. I got the niku beef udon and I did appreciate the note of yuzu in the broth as well as the accompanying gobo tempura which was fun to eat!It's no Marugame Udon but a welcome addition to the sparse amount of udon options in SF.</p>
<p>I love udon and this place did not disappoint!! There is always a line but it moves pretty quickly. I went on a Tuesday night and wait was around 20 mins. The space is pretty small but the staff does a great job at organizing everything. I got the Kakiage udon and I loved it. The noodle texture was perfect and the broth was on the lighter side, but still flavorful. I tried a bite of my friends Dan Dan udon and it was sooo good, definitely will get that next time I'm in the mood for dry udon. Overall one of my favorite udon spots in the city and I will come back to try them all!</p>
<p>We ordered the Niku Beef Udon and the Kakiage Udon. Both were served with hot broth. As soon as my husband brought the two bowls on a tray from the pick up counter to our table I was like, "Oh crap, I forgot to ask them to put all the fried stuff on the side!" Most of the deep fried vegetables instantly turned soggy. I took a couple quick photos and then we took some of the vegetable pieces out of the soup and put them on a napkin or in a empty water cup. Fried vegetables and shrimp tempura do taste yummy dipped in the broth, but I think they should be dipped in the broth bite by bite. Maybe they are supposed to be soggy. It's just my personal preference for soups but I find Japanese udon broths to be a little too sweet, but both noodle bowls still tasted quite good and satisfying. I'd like to try one of their cold udon dishes in the future.The cashier seemed kinda stern at first but when I asked her about the sake offerings she was really sweet and recommended mixing one of the sodas with a sake. It sounded delicious. I'll have to try that next time.</p>
<p>Stopped by here on a Thursday night after reading the Infatuation SF article. As a big fan of Marugame, I was happy to see an udon shop pop up on Divis and was curious what their spin would be for this classic Japanese dish.Ambiance - The restaurant is fairly small, but the tables are spaced out enough that it doesn't feel like you are squished like sardines. It's clean, modern, no real complaintsService - There's some table service. You order and pickup the food at the counter. The staff will service the table when you leave.Food - The udon is definitely made from fresh and high quality ingredients. We got the Niku and Fukuoka which are both fairly standard arrangements for udon. We were both a big fan of the vegetable root tempura that we got as an add-on. Overall, I think the udon was quite good. The tempura options were limited but they were high quality and worth the addition. Is it worth the wait though? When you check Google Maps it will likely suggest that there is no wait. There is in fact a fairly long wait. The restaurant is only 15ish seats and you will likely wait 30ish minutes before ordering. I think this place is worth visiting if you can swing by in the off hours, but maybe skip if it's peak time (6-7)I did see a fair number of people ordering takeout so that's an option too if you don't want to wait.</p>
<p>*Simple restaurant with delicious udon. I got The Curry which game with high quality meat and vegetables. Absolutely satisfying, especially during the winter.*Service was fast and straightforward. You purchase on the front desk and they serve you when the food is ready.*The restaurant is quite small and can only seat a few at a time. If you want to have a guaranteed spot without a long wait, I recommend coming early.</p>
<p>8.2023Newest Udon shop in town! AMBIANCE: Very small location on Divisadero that seats 2-6 people. Parking can also be a challenge due to the location, but we actually got lucky and found a spot down the street. I can imagine this place getting really packed on the weekends. SERVICE: You order your food at the counter and grab a table and wait for your order to be called. We arrived just before the rush on a Friday night. But there are at least 5 parties waiting for seats after ordering - so definitely not a place to chill while dining in. Service was pretty quick and very friendly. FOOD: They service Fukuoka udon style noodles with cold and hot soups including dry and soupy noodles. Most bowls come with tempered veggies or roots (even shiso leaves) - which is different than the typical udon places. They also have udon bowls I haven't seen in other places! The udon noodles were perfectly chewy - not too mushy or too al dente. I appreciated that each bowl was super flavorful and not too heavy. I am definitely adding K+K to the go-to udon list. The only con I have with them is the limited tables.</p>
<p>I was really excited to try out this restaurant since I heard that the restaurant made their own udon in store. Additionally, I found out about this on Instagram, since it's a new restaurant that had a lot of hype, and I think that it's worth trying.Food: 4/5I went for the Niku Beef Udon, and there were things I really enjoyed. The crispy fried topping added a delightful crunch and a burst of flavor that stood out. While the broth and noodles didn't quite hit the highest udonstandards, they were decent. The beef, however, was not as good I'd like. I thought that it would have been fattier and more tender. My friend ordered the Beef Curry Udon which was better, in my opinion. I think that the Niku Beef Udon broth didn't have as much flavor.Atmosphere: 4/5The restaurant has a cute and cozy vibe, which might resonate with some diners. However, it's a bit on the small side, which could make it feel cramped during busy times.Service: 5/5The staff here was friendly and attentive, which definitely added to the overall experience. Their warmth and helpfulness created a welcoming atmosphere.Overall: 4/5Katsuo + Kombu is off to a good start. While there's room for improvement, especially with the broth and noodles, the standout fried topping and the overall potential make it a place worth keeping an eye on. The charming atmosphere and friendly service provide a welcoming backdrop for a budding udon spot. However, I think that there are better udon restaurants in the city</p>
<p>A line was at the door when we arrived for Wednesday dinner, and the wait was around 15 minutes. The host/cashier was friendly and made sure everyone would have a seat once inside.We ordered the Tan Tan Dry and the Fukuoka Signature. I ate the Fukuoka, and it found it very light and flavorful. I couldn't get enough of the broth and drank it all even after finishing the noodles. The noodles were light and the perfect portion. Everything else added to the dish without being overwhelming. Loved my meal and definitely need to come again to try other dishes!</p>
<p>Yum yum yum! Drove 15 mins to try Katsuo + Kombu and it did not disappoint, even after waiting in line for about 30 minutes for our party of four.We tried the Niku Beef, Curry Wagyu Beef, Kakiage Shrimp, and Cold Chicken Karaage Udons. The curry beef had a wonderfully umami richness and the beef was so fall-off-the-nonexistent-bone tender. The crispy kale complimented the curry really nicely too.All were tasty, but when I come back I think I'll get the Kakiage Shrimp with an extra side of tempura shrimp and mixed vegetables. Those toppings are so tasty and delicious; having a bit more will make the ratio just right.I'll also get the cold chicken karaage udon again. I loved how refreshing it was. The kosho paste on the chicken was a nice touch. We heard takeout only takes about 10 minutes, but it was nice to have it hot/fresh...</p>
<p>Great udon spot! I came by on a Friday for dinner, and they have a QR code to join a waitlist. We waited for about 20 minutes, but the inside only fits about 10 parties so expect a wait. Once a table was available, we ordered at the front counter and took a seat, where the food was brought to us. The menu is small but has a large variety of udon dishes to try. I ordered the toriten bukkake, and my friend got the mentai yamakake bukkake. The toriten comes with chicken tempura, which was fried to perfection! It was super juicy and the yuzu complimented it perfectly. My friend's dish had yam with cod roe, which made for an interesting texture with the noodles. The udon had a great chew and were really yummy, and the broth was nice and light. The next time I come, I'd love to try the tempura dishes, which looked huge. Overall, it's a great spot to grab a casual and delicious dinner in the city, and I'm happy to have more options to eat udon. The inside of the restaurant is small, but bright and clean. I'd highly recommend!</p>
<p>Summary:Tasty dishes, but mushy noodlesDetails:Been meaning to swing by for a while, and finally made it out last week. Despite the seemingly long line around 7pm on a Monday, it actually moved surprisingly quickly, with the restaurant emptying out around 8pm, and then getting a second wave of busy-ness closer to 9pm again.Being fatasses, we decided to split three bowls, getting a kakiage, tan tan dry, and mentai yamakake bukkake, to somewhat mixed feelings. The overall flavor of the tan tan was the most exciting, while the kakiage had a wonderful broth but underseasoned veggie tempura, and the mentai yamakake benefited from being the only one that had more springy noodles as a virtue of it being a cold dish, but was a tad too bland for me as well.Cold dish aside, or even considering that one, the udon in every one of our bowls felt like it was somewhat overcooked, and almost borderline mushy: we didn't get that nice springy QQ quality from just-right udon that we were expecting, which was probably the biggest letdown here. Still, arguably better than what you'd get at Marugame, so I could see myself coming back.Accessibility:You order from a tablet that's at bar counter height, so this might prove to be a little difficult for some folks. Orders are called out by number and placed at this same counter, but the staff seems to be pretty willing to help if you can't bring food to your own table, so that's a plus! Seating, otherwise, is largely accessible.</p>
<p>the newest addition to sf's noodle scene. it's been pretty overhyped, so my expectations were a little high. approx an hour wait on a thursday night. order at the counter, pick up food when called. no table service. the kakiage udon broth was clean and light, but I personally didn't love the citrus notes. my friends and i thought it was too acidic for our taste. i also wish the broth was piping hot especially for the chilly night, but it was just warm. the udon was overcooked. didn't get the bouncy texture we were expecting. the tempura was nicely battered and crispy, although the mixed root veg was more aesthetic than practical for me. would love if they cut them into smaller strips for ease, but still yummy. i need to come back and give the cold/dry udon a try before making a final call, but overall it was a fine first experience. nothing special. looking forward to updating my review after a second visit.</p>
<p>Got a question about Mattina? Ask the Yelp community!</p>
<p>Dinner several times and the pasta is outstanding.  Inventive, but delicious. Not your average Italian fare. We get the meatballs, the Brussels sprouts and fried Cauliflower, and the 3 of us ordered separate pasta dishes. Their Italian wine list is outstanding.Sorry, I didn't photograph my food!</p>
<p>I was excited to take our annual holiday group lunch to Mattina; unfortunately, we were very disappointed.We went for the food which was fine but nothing outstanding. The service was very poor. The staff was overwhelmed with no manager to support, and so our table just languished. We had to open and pour all of our own wines. We had to ask for the table to be cleared and reset. We had to ask for coffee. They made a big mistake on the bill.We could look past all of this if there was a genuine sense of hospitality at Mattina but that is not the case. No greeting, no checking on the table, no thank you or goodbye. Really, no appreciation for the customer.Overall, we found it expensive for what they served and the service was so unorganized that we would not return or recommend to others. There are too many great restaurants in SF to spend your time or money here.</p>
<p>A very beautiful space with a cafe attached to it! I'd give the food 6.5/10. It was good, just not mind blowing. Service was good, not exceptional but our server did give us some recommendations.The food tastes really fresh but lacked a bit in flavor. The cornmeal crespelle was pretty disappointing, it was cold and the crepe was not great. I really enjoyed the sugar snap peas and tagliatelle. Very solid dishes with great balance of flavors. I was very excited to try the ice cream sandwich, but it did not meet expectations. The ice cream layer was very thin and uneven, and some got the short end of the stick when it came to sharing. The sandwich part was also still very frozen/hard to bite through. Visually looks so beautiful so I wish taste was at that level.There are so many Italian spots in the city it's hard to out perform others, and unfortunately this one did not.</p>
<p>I came here for dinner with a friend and was impressed by how they can transition from their daytime cafe to nice dinner spot. I liked how the menu included pastas I'd never tried before. The canederli was super unique - I actually enjoyed the chewy texture and flavor of the bread dumplings a lot. The arancini was a solid appetizer to precede our pastas and came with a really tasty sauce. I'd say the food is just ever so slightly overpriced for what you get. This probably wouldn't be my first choice for Italian in the area, but it's still a decent neighborhood restaurant to enjoy some good food.</p>
<p>Summary:Tasty coffee and excellent biscuitsDetails:Being our third lunch stop of the day, we didn't exactly have room for any more real food, and opted to keep it simple with a coffee and one of their butter and jam biscuits, both of which ended up being unexpected winners.The coffee itself stood out more for their beans than the craftsmanship itself, the latter of which I found a bit lacking (I mean, look at that latte art), but the former was quite excellent, with them using St Frank's beans.The real winner here though were the biscuits, which I wasn't expecting much out of when they first set them down, given it looked both dry and burnt. To our surprise though, it was one of, if not the most, buttery, crumbly, and moist biscuits I've had in the Bay area, possibly rivaling my favorites even up in Seattle proper. Will absolutely come by again just for these.Accessibility:Plenty of accessible options both inside and outside!</p>
<p>Do you have a friend where you know dinner is going to be a feast?  At the end of the night, you've eaten so much that one more mint will make you explode.  For most people, I am that friend.  I had dinner with a great friend and colleague here.  I was really excited since both of us can put away a lot of food.  It's a really solid Cal-Italian experience.  We shared the beef meatballs, cherry tomato salad, stuffed eggplant (eggplant stuffed with eggplant), summer squash, tagliatelle, mafaladine, 16 oz beef rib eye and the choc-oat gelato and cherry coppetta.  That beef rib-eye was definitely the highlight of the meal but both of the pastas were also fabulous.  I have a slight preference for the tagliatelle though my friend liked the mafaladine more.  Service was excellent and the restaurant space is cavernous.  With tax and tip, this ended up being $170 per person - this could have easily fed four people (about $85 per person).  I am admittedly a harder grader when it comes to Italian food in SF given all the great options but this is definitely a good option when you are in this part of town.</p>
<p>The food was great. You have to order that Tagliatelle with mushrooms & Buccatini with pesto. It was fantastic. The service was great, Joseph was very patient, friendly & helpful. We loved it so much we went back for breakfast. I don't usually eat biscuits, but Mattina changed that! It was the best biscuit I've ever had, with prosciutto, cheese & egg and seemingly truffle. I highly recommend!</p>
<p>Came initially for the breakfast sandos, but stayed for the rest.I came in a Sunday around 10 and pretty much no line and lots of outdoor seating. They don't serve the main menu until 11. We got the prosciutto & cheese biscuit ($11.50) and added an egg (+ $2) as well as the ricotta and hazelnut honey bruschetta ($9). The biscuits were a good portion size, although wished it was slightly fluffier but otherwise good. I also felt like it needed something sweet or like a hot honey to balance all the saltiness from the prosciutto. I'm glad with hot the bruschetta because it helped to balance the saltiness. Came back for dinner another day and ordered several things to share! Cornmeal Crespelle ($19)-Crepe like and a bit softer than we expected, but I personally enjoyed it. Bruchetta ($9)- the toma cheese & pickled peppers. My friend really liked this one, but I think I liked the one from the morning better. We also shared the ravioli ($28)- which was fine, but we felt like could have had more filling and smaller pieces. The tagiatelle ($28) with mushroom and truffle, was really really good. Both of our favorites. Overall, both experiences were good! I like the casual atmosphere for brunch, but also a good catch up spot or date for dinner.</p>
<p>Pretty quiet during the weekday morning/lunch hours, so it's perfect to come chill with a cup of coffee at their parklet or inside space. Their biscuit sandwich was savory and filling, and we paired it with their iced lattes. The workers were super attentive and checking in from time to time as my friend and I enjoyed our cafe outing! Will have to come back to try their dinner menu to see how else their food is like.</p>
<p>Overall, I'd give Mattina a 8/10. The bruschetta was the star of the show, which was a bit disappointing as we decided to dine here for the pastas. The pastas were a bit underwhelming. The octopus appetizer had very few pieces of octopus in it. Although everything tasted fine, I had higher hopes.</p>

<p>Tried this place for the first time today. The food was tasty, though the portions were a tad small for the price. Great service. Would love to come back again!</p>
<p>Exciting new Italian restaurant in the Filmore that's a bit on the pricey side. Most of the pasta entrees are $27+ and the proportions are sufficient for 1 serving, just barely. I ordered the yellow corn ravioli and the tricolore bruschetta. The ravioli had a yummy creamy sauce it was served with a spoon because there's more than just the ravioli (garnished with plenty of yellow corn, red pepper, and okra if i remember right).The service was great - the server was very knowledgeable about items on the menu and very responsive. And the atmosphere is really nice. It definitely feels like a modern, upscale spot. There's plenty of bar seating to go along with the table/couches. Looking forward to trying their morning menu as well!</p>
<p>Honestly the food was overpriced - didn't enjoy the pasta flavors too much either. The staff was a bit rude as well</p>
<p>I'd say the best part of this meal was the coffee (although I couldn't really taste the mushroom syrup) and the bruschetta (which I feel like wasn't too special). The all-day menu items we picked overall weren't amazing for the expensive price. We picked items that our server had recommended so I'm not sure I'd come back to try something else. If I come back I think I'd only stop by for coffee and pick up a pastry.The ambiance was great though - it was really pretty and felt like I was in a restaurant in Paris.</p>
<p>Mattina offers both breakfasts (till 2 pm) and dinner service. I've only been there in the morning, but it hits all the marks for what I look for in a coffee shop. The Interior is new & modern, the service is on point, and their baked goods are addicting.What really stands out to me is their unique combination of flavors. I've never had the Mushroom Latte before, but the mushroom fragrance compliments the soft latte flavor surprisingly well. The black pepper & cheddar scone is so satisfying to bite into. Highly recommend! FYI they're only open on Thu - Sun.</p>
<p>Such a gem! Really excited that Mattina is open - and I think I personally like it more than SPQR.It's a great neighborhood centric spot and I love the concept of a more casual all day cafe. Their coffee and pastries are delicious, and their plates are also wonderful.My favorite so far is the mushroom tagliatelle which is an incredibly well executed classic mushroom marsala situation that hits all the right notes when I'm fiending for a shroom pasta. Other items are also lovely - like the roasted peppers and the lemony bucatini.Service is pretty efficient as well (makes it easy to pop in). While prices aren't cheap, the food is high quality and has the attention to detail to match.</p>
<p>When a 10-time Michelin star recipient opens a sister resto...that won't break yo' wallet...too bad...you go...NOW. Before it gets too crazy.Soft opening last month is SPQR's all day café. SPQR is Cal-Italin resto that's received a Michelin star for 10 years in a row (since 2012), though they lost it last year. They're currently serving breakfast and lunch (rolled out last week) with dinner service to come.They have indoor and dog-friendly outdoor seating. No umbrellas or heat lamps.Is it fast-casual or full-service? I visited for lunch and I was confused so I hope communication improves. M E N U* Breakfast: Scones, charcoal biscuit and biscuit sandwiches, and cookies.* Lunch (dinner service to come): Apps, salads, housemade pastas, entrees (from charcoal grill), sides, and desserts (softs serve).  * Drinks: Coffee and wine. F O O D* Tagliatelle w/ marsala mushrooms & truffle cheese ($28): https://tinyurl.com/mwmbj7z2It's been a hot minute since I've visited SPQR. I loved their pastas so skipped the grilled meat for carbs.My fav part of the dish were the meaty and earthy mushrooms draped with ribbons of nutty + salty truffle cheese. The housemade tagliatelle was overcooked for my preference. The sauce was like a creamy mushroom bisque. While tasty, I was hoping for more tamarind-like tang from the marsala. * Miso Butterscotch Cookie ($4.25): https://tinyurl.com/yckpxkybDeliciously buttery and crispy edges and a chewy center. The miso added a unique savory flavor to balance the sweetness of the butterscotch and chocolate chips.  S E R V I C ECordial and prompt.Room for improvement: Staff didn't ask if it was for "here" or "to-go" and assumed the latter. After paying, I asked where I could grab utensils and that's when they asked if it was for "here" and brought me utensils, plate, and a napkin.A M B I A N C E Casual bistro café seating in front with a more formal seating in back for date night. Counter seating so you can oversee the action on the open kitchen.It was quiet for lunch with just a couple of customers...for now.P A R K I N GDifficult street parking.Overall, happy to see SPQR open an all day café esp for those who eat at off hours and want pasta or steak at 11 am or 3 pm!</p>
<p>Solid place to grab coffee or lunch in fillmore! Standouts: Candycap latte (I preferred hot over iced): 5/5 I've seen candycap on a ton of fine dining menus recently, so was excited to try this- did not disappoint! No mushroom flavor, kind of reminded me of the cascara latte if you've had this at Starbucks, but a lot more refined.Arancini: 5/5, get this! Bruschetta: tricolor with bufala (4/5) this was good but tasted like a margherita pizza and was pretty pricey. ricotta with hazelnut (5/5): perfect balance of sweet and creamy, ate like a dessert.Mediocre:Pastas (3/5) Both the chicken ravioli and bucatini were just ok and felt very expensive for what we got (~$25 each).Miso cookie (2/5) Way too sweet for me. All in all I'd come back just for the coffee and small plates, the total bill came out to $130 which was fine since it was a friend's birthday but way too expensive otherwise.Miso cookie</p>
<p>This was a visit at the soft opening of the new all day Cal-Italian cafe from the Chef of SPQR.Another guest suggested that there is only one good bakery in each neighborhood, as we looked across at Fillmore Bakeshop, a great bakery. He said I wasn't loyal to one bakery since I visit various bakeries. Mattina, welcome to the neighborhood! There is definitely room for as many good bakeries as possible in each neighborhood. The more pastries the better!This is a lovely, airy space, with a few seats outside, tables near the entrance and a banquette on the right. I was warmly greeted by the counterperson, who explained the different pastry options. I had seen photos of the biscuit on Instagram, and chose it without prosciutto, as a vegetarian. With egg and cheese, it is a great light lunch. The biscuit is well baked, and very good. I also tried the black garlic and cheddar scone, and miso butterscotch cookie. The scone is perfectly balanced in flavor; the cookie, sweet and savory, is outstanding.I look forward to the expanded menu which will be coming soon. Please stop by when you're in the neighborhood!</p>
<p>My husband and I went on a Saturday morning around 9 o'clock! The restaurant has a small area to have breakfast, so it's not easy to find a spot but we were lucky! We ordered the biscuit with jam to split and 2 coffees. The biscuit is big enough for 2 people if you already have breakfast at home like us.It was good and I liked the contrast between the salt on the top and the sweet of the jam; maybe it was enough just the half because the contrast was strong. The decor is very beautiful...I can't wait to try other biscuits and dishes.</p>
<p>Very nice. Went in the 30mins to closing to grab a good meal. First time and was very happy with the customer service and food.  Ambiance pleasant . Loud from big party but otherwise 10/10 will return.</p>
<p>delicious mediterranean white fish, medium rare lamb; refreshing kale salad and very decent brussel sproutsnice upscale cozy environment. lovely dark ambiance with warm lighting and a highly attentive and friendly staffspecial thanks to the waiters who arranged anniversary champagne and cake, recommend the blind butcher for a special night out</p>
<p>Visited Blind Butcher for a family farewell dinner and the ambiance was exactly what we were looking for, intimate and cozy. Although the restaurant is smaller, they do have a long table that can accommodate larger group. I definitely recommending ordering a variety of plates because they are shareable. Most known for their House Butchered Meats, the prime rib was juicy and perfectly cooked (coming from someone who does not normally go for the red meat). The servers were attentive, friendly, and stayed ready to refill your drink!</p>
<p>Hubby took us here right celebrate our 31st Wedding Anniversary and we of always invite our son everywhere we go as he is a product of Love! Let's start with the med height guy with a curled mustache I think who greeted us, he was meh not too attentive but okay, sat us down in the corner booth table because I asked for that, sure wished he told me of another booth table in the back with more space as we are very tall people, nonetheless we were snug & comfy which was all that mattered! Then a young blond guy with a half ponytail bartender I believe came and took our drink order! My son mentions happily to him ... it's my parents 31st anniversary... and this guy just had this blank stare as if he were saying in his head ... AND? ... gave him our drink order and another guy took our appetizer order maybe the guy who sat us down? Can't remember! Throughout the night a very tall handsome server who we saw treat every guest with a huge smile and laughter and silently I wished he was our Server! Entree time we sort of got my wish cause he came and asked if we were ready to order and the one that sat us down pushed through and said not so nicely ... I GOT IT ... and we watched the Happy one walk away still smiling! He later came and asked if I wanted anything else and I asked for more wine and could not help but squeeze in there how I loved how he treated his guests and his smile! Didn't get his name but I do remember his face and will definitely ask to sit in his area!  That was that! We loved the ambiance and if all the servers were like the tall guy, well you'll be seeing us more!Now the food ... absolutely delicious! The calamari was the only meh dish we had, kinda rubbery but had a delicious taste. Sorry won't be ordering that again! I love me some crunch and some tentacles in my calamari ha ha!Those other two servers would smile and be like the tall server this night would've been even more amazing! From the ambience to the food to the wine everything was just wonderful even with those two hiccups! So Blind Butcher we will be back but we will ask to sit in the happy tall guys area!</p>
<p>I wanted to give this place 3.5 stars. The ambiance is great, it was pretty packed on a Thursday night and in a great location in Castro. The service was a little slow (probably bc they were busy) and forgot our drinks until after the food came. The food was ok, I was excited for the Wagyu burger ($27) but it was a lot smaller than I expected, and the meat was SO dry I couldn't even finish it. I wish they put other toppings inside it like lettuce, pickles, or anything to give some juiciness. The fries that came with it were delicious though! My partner got a chicken dish that was tastier and more worth the price. The mashed potatoes it came with were really great! If I come back here, I would definitely try the Mac and cheese after all the positive reviews about it!</p>
<p>While we were eating at Blind Butcher, a guy casually walks by nekkid...full frontal and everything...and hardly anyone bats an eye.Except the tourist couple whose jaws were sweeping the floor.That's what I love about The Castro...if you got the balls to, anything goes!Been eyeing The Blind Butcher since they opened in 2019 (sister resto to Dunya and Lark). And, my curiosity further grew with their hype on socials. When Plan A fell through, Blind Butcher it is because last minute rezzies were very easy to get. But, rezzies weren't needed since it was pretty empty on a Thursday. So, if you're looking for last minute place for a weeknight dinner, Blind Butcher may be a good option.Blind Butcher is open for takeout and dine-in. No delivery.

We were hungry so we ate it and requested another round to come with the steak.* Butcher's Wagyu Burger w/ bourbon caramelized onions, kasseri cheese, horseradish aioli, fries, ciabatta ($27): https://tinyurl.com/bdhspdau--Requested medium rare--Requested upgrade to truffle friesTasty, juicy patty with a sturdy ciabatta bun, cooked medium rare as requested. However, it was small and expensive compared to the bougie burgers at Nopa, Spruce, and Miller & Luxe that have a thicccer patty and same price point. I know wagyu is in its name but it's a buzzword that's loosely thrown around these days.Instead of the truffle fries, we received regular fries dusted with old bay (?). They were ok and could have been hotter and crisper.* 16 oz Prime Ribeye, rosemary-oregano marinated w/ chimichurri ($68): https://tinyurl.com/pwyn35kh--Requested medium rareLooked awesome and the medium rare was on-point! However, for being a marinated prime cut, it was quite chewy. I know it's shrinkflation times but Lolinda has a similar 18 oz ribeye for $52. The accompanying chimichurri was hella salty so I appreciated that it was on the side. The ribeye includes several pieces of roasted potatoes, shishito peppers, and a tomato. Had we known this, we wouldn't have ordered another side of mashed potatoes.S E R V I C E Our server was nice and upbeat. Maybe it was an off day but service was too lax and lacked attention to detail. After we finished our meal, we had to go inside twice to ask for the bill...in a near empty restaurant (only one other table occupied).Food service was fast; apps arrived within minutes of ordering.A M B I A N C ECozy and sultry date night vibes with red banquettes and nice bar area. There's four patio tables in front.P A R K I N GChallenging street parking so give yourself an extra 15-20 minutes. No nearby garages.Overall, I have mixed feelings about Blind Butcher. While they nailed the meat temps, I didn't think the food and service was commensurate to a $100 pp dining experience. IMHO, there's plenty of other places in the city you can better spend that monies. Glad I tried it once tho.</p>
<p>This place is so so yummy! My boyfriend found it on tik tok and we gave it a shot during one of our weekend stays in SF. We had the ribeye board and it came with shishito peppers, tomato, potatoes and a side of chimichurri. The ribeye was SO good and the bucatini we had was delicious too. Definitely a higher price point restaurant but everything was delicious even our cocktails. I wouldn't think twice about coming again!</p>
<p>Absolutely amazing food, service and ambience! It's in a busy area in the Castro so plenty of do after dinner!We loved that they were able to accommodate our big group and sat us pretty quickly. Our waiter, Curtis, was amazing and extremely attentive the entire evening. Even reading the note on open table that it was our friends birthday and brought him out birthday desserts. The food tastes just as good as it looks! Id recommend sharing the ribeye and ordering some sides. It's good enough to feed 3. It's a big boy! Our friends ordered the rosemary chicken and not pictured is the Wagyu burger which my friend said he could lick and eat the whole plate! Will be coming back soon!</p>
<p>Came in on a wednesday night to celebrate a birthday. We had reservations so we were seated right away. There are a good amount of tables along the wall in a pretty intimate space. We noticed it was quite busy even for a wednesday. We ordered calamari, potatoes, prime rib eye, and pork chop. We loved it all. The rib eye was cooked perfectly medium and came with little potatoes and peppers on the side. The pork chop was moist and had lots of carrots and potatoes in the sauce. The calamari was thick and tasted really well with the sauce. The potatoes were a great side and perfectly cooked. We did family style and between the 3 of us, there were still some leftovers. We ordered the opera cake and tiramisu for dessert. The cakes were moist and rich and a perfect way to end our dinner. Overall i was really impressed with the food and cant wait to come back again.</p>
<p>DON'T LET THE NAME FOOL YOU - Great place even for vegetarians / pescatarians!!! Their Hip wood-based decor with ambient lighting makes for a cozy date night spot.Started off with some fresh fries lightly tossed in spices. Crisp outside, mushy inside (perfect)! They served some chardonnay to go with the appetizer. The main course was a family style butcher board (which my friends verified was delicious) and the lobster mac & cheese. Generous portions of lobster in the dish, with a perfect crisp cheese layer up top and gooey bits inside. The mac and cheese was served in a cast iron pan which kept it warm throughout our meal. Macaroni was al dente, and the bite on the pasta mixed so well with the mushy cheese! Service was excellent and they accommodated my vegetarian dietary preferences by serving me a Moussaka from their neighbor restaurant "Lark". It was mildly spiced and had lots of fresh veggies. Finally, the merlot that was served with the main course was rich with some fruity notes. Great for sipping though a conversation. Must visit the Blind Butcher!</p>
<p>I was really impressed with the branzino and the Elderberry cocktail, but less so with the practically raw shishito peppers. The service was scatterbrained and we were often left waiting long periods of time to place orders. Our two hour meal could have expediently been half that with more attentive service. The dining area was nevertheless nicely decorated and dark enough and loud enough to impart some privacy, though not so much of either to be miserable. Overall, standard overpriced meal in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Before I dive into my review, I want to mention that for me personally, food alone is 3/5, but I gave an extra star because of the ambiance.Let's talk about the food first. My friend and I ordered these dishes -1. Butcher's wagyu sliders (small bites)2. Crispy calamari3. Rack of lamb4. TiramisuWagyu sliders were definitely bigger than what I had in mind. The meat was very juicy, and the buns were soft. That, combined with the aioli sauce, made the sliders delicious. Crispy calamari wasn't much crispy and was okay. The rack of lamb was also okay. The meat was very tender and well cooked but lacked flavors. It came with horseradish sauce, but it was too strong. Tiramisu was delicious. It was very light and just the right amount of sweetness.This place is a great date night spot because of the ambiance. It's very modern, cozy, warm, and welcoming. The walls are covered with photos and paintings of old artists and San Francisco city from back in the days. There was jazz music playing in the background, and I liked it, though I wish it wasn't as loud. Our server was really nice and was on top of taking care of us.</p>
<p>Years ago, I raved about this place and awaited the day I would come back. Unfortunately, the dishes weren't as incredible as I remembered. Besides the brussel sprouts, which were seriously the best appetizer I've had recently! Each piece was a crispy, sweet and salty morsel that would change anyone's mind about this vegetable. The Grilled Prosciutto Burrata appetizer was a favorite as well. Other than that, the wagyu burger which my group and I all ordered was pretty average. I guess in my head I hyped it up so as I ate it, it felt quite dry and underwhelming. I ordered mine cooked medium too so not sure how it didn't hold its moisture. The ciabatta was dry and complicated the burger experience too. Another dish that fell short was the truffle lobster mac and cheese. As much as I wanted to believe there was lobster in this, I feel like it was crawfish... the flavor, the size, all just insinuated crawfish in the soupy cheese sauce. It had somewhat of a fishy/seafood flavor to the dish and no noticeable truffle taste. Although the entrees underperformed, the service absolutely did not. We didn't have a reservation and they were booked for dinner, but the host made it work with some open outdoor space. He constantly made sure we were comfortable and got our food out quickly. The chef also stopped by our table throughout the meal. He was bouncing between their neighboring sister restaurants and thanked us for visiting them. I would come back for the apps, drinks, and hospitality!</p>
<p>The moment I had got there it was a great ambiance. It was a busy night and I thought I had out my reservation in but it was on the wrong day! They were very able to accommodate me anyway! Plus one star! Staff and service was very nice. Overall: 1 star added for the service alone which was very friendly, but as a food critic and something of a culinary artist myself I cannot bring myself to give this place more than one star for the food.The nitty gritty:I ordered the prime ribeye medium rare and came out super rare. The cook must have not let it sit the appropriate amount of time before cutting and serving.The octopus was undercooked as well, leaving a gummy undercooked seafood texture we all know as sashimi shrimp.However the sauce and herbs surrounding the dish was superb and I ate each bite with it.The back of the octopus was cooked perfectly so they must not have used something to hold it down as it grilled.We ordered the calamari which was greasy and the breading was soggy :(.The waygu burger was alright but still undercooked to how we had requested.Truffle fries were really good.I was really amped to go here and try it out due to the hype on social media and I feel they may be overwhelmed by all the new attention it has been receiving.The taste was all there but the preparation needs work. For the price it cost to eat here I may not be coming back.It was a nice effort though. They were pretty crowded.Edit: I actually decided to downgrade my star review because the dishes were unique and good quality. But I shouldn't be paying over 180$ for a meal that is brought out raw. I know what kind of neighborhood it is but not everyone likes it raw. Also if there is something wrong with every single dish we ordered, quality control must be instilled. Idk if he was on vacation or what but this was completely unacceptable.</p>
<p>Welcomed and enjoyed our evening assisted by Manny. We ordered the Brussels sprouts- very tasty! Also the burrata ravioli and the short rib- plentiful portions and good flavor. Frankly the ravioli tasted more like ricotta than burrata but the freshness of the homemade pasta and the delicious sauce were fantastic. Short rib was fall off the bone and the amount of the meat was commensurate with the price. Lovely meal. We chose toeat  outdoors which was great but inside looked so cozy and hip!</p>
<p>Everything was cooked to perfection and seasoned well. I thoroughly enjoyed the steak, and absolutely loved the octopus appetizer. The service was really quick, we didn't wait long for any of our dishes, including water refills & check. Would highly recommend!</p>
<p>Cozy/moody ambiance, wonderful service, and delicious, flavorful food. We especially loved the roast chicken with veggies and potatoes, short ribs and potatoes, and the overall variety of dishes they offer. There is something for everyone, and the dishes are shareable. Drinks and dishes are on the pricier end however the quality is good. Hope to visit again soon.</p>
<p>Celebrating an early bday for bff-fam at Blind Butcher. Ever since they posted their iconic celebratory reel on the gram, we needed to check out all the fanfare it generated. Vibes are completely chill w/ eclectic art, plush red booth seats, and dim lighting...giving jazz club vibes for cool cats. Menu is simple there are apps, protein options and whole braised branzino to feed a small family of 9...so we got two of those because why not. lol Please do not sleep on the apps: Crispy Calamari, Grilled Octopus, Shishito, Truffle French Fries... and the table ordered to share Braised Short Ribs, Lamb Chops, Ribeye Steak, & Prawns. The kid ordered their lobster truffle mac. Dylan helping our table was amazing...beautiful, attentive, and super accommodating and friendly. Made the dinner so comfortable and our groupreally enjoyed. Go here and order everything. Street parking and a lot off Castro St. entrance, we got lucky and found one right in front. Planning to revisit in the near future! Thank you/Mahalo Blind Butcher!</p>
<p>Came to Blind Butcher to Celebrate my daughter's birthday and the host and everyone around was so nice and welcoming. Love the atmosphere and the food was 10/10 We all enjoyed our dinner party and will definitely be back.</p>
<p>Came here for an early Father's Day celebration.  We ordered a few dishes and decided to do it family style.  Everything was delicious and came out relatively quick.  Definitely worth a revisit. My only critique is that there were 5 of us and two small round tables were put together to accommodate us.  Sitting wise we had plenty of space but once the food came it was a game of shuffle to make space.</p>
<p>good food buenisima comida ya he ido varias veces se los recomiendo demasiado vayan y visitelos</p>
<p>Little Shucker is the shuckin' best! My husband and I came here for date night and we loved our experience.  The highlight for me was the oysters, raw and baked!  You could tell that the oysters were super fresh.  We had kumamotos, miyagis, and mere point oysters for our raw oysters, I believe. For the baked oysters, we tried the garlic butter (YUM), and the miso bone marrow (my personal fave!).  The spritz cocktails are really good too.  We tried the pink spritz and the lavender yuzu spritz (super refreshing).  I also liked that they had a natural wine on the menu. :)Little Shucker is perfect for date night or girls' night out!  The vibes and interior are super cute too.  Can't wait to come back.</p>
<p>I've been on an oyster kick these days and Little Shucker was such a fantastic place to dabble. It's not cheap and you can quickly rack up a bill here, but it is surely worth the price you pay. Everything is so fresh and tasty. My friend and I came for lunch with a reservation but it wasn't too crowded. We got six Oysters, the Halibut Crudo, Smoked Salmon Tartine, and the Roasted Nori Cauliflower. The oysters were incredibly refreshing, and we love that we got to sample all three. I also loved the small plates we ordered. The cauliflower was so umami and had a nice bite to it, while the tartine was so hearty and creamy. Service was decent. Nothing to write home about but the atmosphere does make it worth the visit, as it's bright but homey.</p>
<p>All the rave reviews are true - this place is a keeper! Perfect location and immaculate vibes, we loved everything about little shucker. We walked in at opening on a Saturday without a reservation and were seated immediately. The waitstaff was completely attentive and took our drink orders right away. One of our guests ordered a wine on tap, and within minutes was informed that they had to switch out the keg. She had to wait about ten minutes for her glass, and when it was brought to her, we were told it was on the house for her patience. She was offered alternatives but really wanted that wine, so despite her choosing to wait they still comped the glass - completely unnecessary but entirely grateful, we were won over immediately. Then the oysters came. In a city brimming with seafood options, this was the freshest of the fresh. We inhaled our dozen (with a variety from Tomales Bag and the east coast) just in time for the mussels to hit the table. When I tell you we were lapping up the garlic marinade, we were fighting over the last spoonful. For a seafood focused restaurant, their fries were also memorable, and the house hot sauce is  chef's kiss. Incredible experience all the way around - can't wait to come back to little shucker!</p>
<p>Fresh seafood, cute interiors, $2 oyster happy hour, and good wine...how could you not have a good time at Little Shucker. This buzzy Pac Heights seafood spot from the team behind The Snug excels when it comes to simple, good seafood. I sampled a majority of the menu, and my favorite item was the Big Shucker, a classic chilled seafood tower that allows the quality to shine. If you love oyster shooters, you have to try their two creative takes - a sake tomato dashi with uni and a play on michelada with kimchi and pilsner. In addition to the tasty raw oyster selection, I also enjoyed the warm bone marrow baked oyster.For more substantial bites, I recommend the smoked salmon tartine with bright dill cream cheese on a fluffy pan de mie. The hot lobster roll was fine, but not as memorable. I would skip adding caviar to the roll, as it got lost with the strong flavors.My friend and I were comfortably full from the seafood feast, but we couldn't resist trying the pretty greek yogurt tart with seasonal stone fruit - a sweet, but restrained ending to a solid meal.I like that the smaller space, friendly staff, and menu lends itself to many occasions, whether it's a casual lunch, early happy hour, or romantic dinner date.</p>
<p>Came here for dinner on a weekend.Food: 4Decor: 4Service: 46 oysters, 22miyagi, kumamoto, and mere point~4/5. Fresh and cleaned properly.hot lobster roll, 35~4/5. Fresh lobster in a nice, hot, toasted bun. Pretty good, although I think New England Lobster Co. in Burlingame is slightly better.Service was nice and friendly.</p>
<p>The cutest spot on Fillmore! Perfect for a sunny day in SF. We ordered the Rockefeller oysters, miso bone marrow oysters, garlic butter oysters and I would recommend them all. We added caviar to the oysters and it was We also got the lobster roll which came with a generous amount of seafood, and the branzino. I would say I've had better branzino elsewhere and would stick to appetizers and drinks here! Great place for friends</p>
<p>Ambiance- decor was really nice and clean, bathrooms were well maintained and the table tops were tidyService- a little awkward and choppy but nice people, but incredibly slow for certain food items Food- some things were delicious and other things needed more attention*Big shucker- presentation was pretty, I think that the oysters were shucked fine, a little shelly but no real complaints. We sat at the bar so we watched them prepare the tower in front of us. The shrimp was really dry and didn't taste fresh at all, however the mussels were our favorite part! The Maine lobster was fine,nothing extraordinary and the geoduck was also okay. *lobster roll- I can't believe they charge 2$ for the chips when the roll is already 35$ I think that's absurd. It was also a small portion and lacked a sauce (butter isn't a sauce) **smoked trout salad- it reminded me of a deconstructed lox bagel in a good way. I wish the portion size was larger or if the plate had more lettuce ** we received our big shucker first at 2:15 and quickly finished the tower in about 10-15 mins because there wasn't a whole lot to it and we were super hungry. But we weren't served our salad and roll until 2:45 which we thought was a super long time to wait between plates. Especially because it wasn't particularly busy and the components of our plates were already made eg: the lobster was precooked and the trout was smoked so assembling the items on a plate shouldn't have taken too long (time stamps attached).  Price- not good, I hadn't realized or noticed that there was a 20% automatic service charge which I think is quite high (for this particular place). We were a group of four but they were kind and they split the bill into two for us because they noticed each couple shared items. I think 17-18% service charge is more realistic. Especially because we had really slow service between our plates.</p>
<p>I have been craving baked oysters lately and it's actually quite hard to find.   Little Shucker appeared on my search and they had a reservation opened so we gave them a try. The ambience is so cute, it's so bright and welcoming, it reminds me being inside sometimes home in some coastal town.  They tend to get busy around 6pm, so I recommend making reservations. They have a happy hour menu too, and if you want that deal you have to come before 5 pm.  For Happy Hour they have raw oysters for 12 or 24 dollars depending if you get half a dozen or a dozen.  And of course, with happy hour there's wine or beer.  For our starters we did get the dozen oysters for $24.00 along with the crudo.  The fresh oysters were good and plump.  They gave you three sauces to pair with, the green sauce was the best. The crudo was paired with their avocado mousse and tomatoes which was so tasty!  I wish they gave us more of that mousse.   We also go the baked oysters which included the rockefeller, garlic butter, and miso bone marrow.  All of these were good, but i think my favorite was the Garlic Butter, followed by the Miso Bone Marrow and then the Rockefeller.   The miso bone marrow said it had cilantro but i couldn't taste it, which was good because i'm not a cilantro fan. The Lobster roll was delicious as you can taste how buttery the bread as and how sweet and juicy the lobster was.  It does get very messy to eat but it's worth the messiness. I hope they can expand their menu soon like their sister restaurant The Snug. I would love to come back and we can tell their staff is a great team as i see them working so well together.</p>
<p>Charming ambiance, delicious flavors, fresh seafood. Favorites were baked oyster miso bone marrow, lobster roll, and mussels.  Branzino was great as well.</p>
<p>This is a great date night or outing spot in SF. I would 100% return for the baked oysters, especially the miso bone marrow. The service was incredibly attentive and we felt the dishes were fresh & delicious. The ambiance was nice, ample spacing around the tables, lighter color palette of the restaurant makes it feel larger, and it wasn't overly loud. 10/10</p>
<p>Summary:Casual seafood cafe offering a small variety of tasty bitesDetails:Little Shucker reminds me a bit of the seafood spots you'd find up in the PNW, with their casual, but creative take on various seafood dishes, albeit with a more limited offering. That's not to say you can't get full here if you order enough of the right dishes, but it definitely has more of a "come here and chill with some drinks and light bites" vibe than a "come stuff your face and belly" one.Everything we had was pretty tasty, but the standouts included their garlic butter baked oysters (the miso bone marrow was just a tad too salty), halibut crudo, and hot lobster rolls (which is prepared differently than their cold), all of which came with very fresh ingredients, and some tasty, yet bright flavors. And honestly, the nori cauliflower was pretty tasty too, but it felt to us like it was mostly just a bunch of tasty banchan dumped on top of roasted cauliflower lol, so the value wasn't quite there on that dish.Worth a stop by, but probably more as the precursor or successor to a nearby meal.Accessibility:Can't speak for the interior, but plenty of accessible outdoor seating!</p>
<p>My recent visit to little shucker in Pacific Heights had its ups and downs. While the lobster roll was meaty, it was on the pricier side and, unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations - it turned out to be rather average.On a more positive note, the Caesar salad was decent and made for a suitable companion to the lobster roll.If you're on the hunt for a great lobster roll, I'd recommend waiting for Broadstreet Oyster to open up in Ghirardelli Square or stop by New England Lobster Company when you are near SFO. The service at little shucker was good, but for a memorable lobster roll experience, it seems I might have to venture elsewhere next time.</p>
<p>My friend brought me here for lunch for a belated birthday. This place is spectacular! All the staff was attentive, friendly, and accommodating, which made the experience so fantastic. I will be returning in the future. Shout out to everyone for such a good experience. The crudo, fried oysters, and the wine options were delightful.</p>
<p>We dined here for lunch. Our group comprised of five adults and two babies. The service couldn't have been friendlier and attentive; especially with our babies joining in on the meal. We ordered oyster shooter lights, the chips and dip, the bread, oysters in the half shell, and the crudo. We happened to be there for happy hour, so that was a pleasant surprise. The shooters were inventive and fun. Everything was presented nicely and most importantly, it was fresh!</p>
<p>Oysters? YES! YES! YES! This new space (in the old Grove location) on Fillmore is just what the city has needed. A simple menu for indulging in fresh seafood, alongside a beautiful wine selection and bar. The restaurant is open and airy with fresh bright colors that just invoke a clean feel. Most oyster and seafood restaurants have a distinctly fishy smell, but not here, no no. We kept it simple with a couple dozen raw oysters, a couple of orders of baked oysters (who doesn't love Oysters Rockefeller?) and the Chips and Dip with the Caviar addition. I had a few Lavender Spritz that were refreshing and light. -Plenty of counter seats to watch the shuckers do their thing or table seating both indoor and outdoor-Unisex restroom -Reservations HIGHLY recommended to insure you get a seat -Service was quick and attentive JUST TREAT YOURSELF & get here if you love Oysters!</p>
<p>Little shucker is has the cutest vibes! My partner and I love oysters so decided to give this spot a try. We got 6 oysters (2 of each type they had), the halibut crudo, mussels, and hot lobster roll. The oysters were super fresh! They give a lemongrass mignonette and two hot sauces with it. The olive oil on the crudo seemed really high quality and had such a good flavor, but honestly I thought it overpowered the halibut a little bit. The mussels were fire. The broth they were in was so delicious, and the portion was pretty big! Id say maybe around 20 mussels or so? I got fries with the mussels too, and they were super crisp and still fluffy in the middle. My partner got the lobster roll, which was good although I think the bread was a bit too buttery for me.</p>
<p>Yayyyy new oyster spot in town :-) My friend booked a dinner reservation for the 4 of us-- AMAZING OYSTERS. To my understanding, they have a rotation, featuring some from Hog Island. Very cool & hip addition to an already quite upscale area.THE BIG SHUCKER: Perfect to split with a group of 4~ All extremely fresh & high quality. NEED to try their house-made green sauce-- it's fantastic.- SMOKED SALMON TARTINE: First time trying tartine on pan de mie, soooo pillowy soft and delicious. Small portions of salmon.- ROASTED NORI CAULIFLOWER: Hearty & umami-- even when shared, the small bowl is surprisingly filling- LOBSTER ROLL (hot): Ngl this is ok. $35 is high for a lobster roll... Tasty, but nothing insane.Only tried the seafood as we had 2 pescatarians in tow-- will need to come back to try the bone marrow another time.</p>
<p>This place really did live up to the hype! So glad we came. What a lovely weekend brunch. I rarely give out 5 stars but this place was very deserving. My sisters and I had been dying to visit this place after it showed up all over instagram and had such great reviews. We came yesterday at noon. It was pretty quiet tbh - their dinner reservations are much harder to get!We ordered a ton of delicious food -- the big shucker, which was great, everything was fresh and amazing -- the salmon tartine, also amazing, and I got the lavender spritz and the lobster roll (warm with butter vs. cold) and added caviar. The spritz was almost too pretty to drink but man was it good! And the lobster roll was absolutely amazing. Maybe just a tad too much butter, but all in all so good. And they give you so much caviar as well! Not cheap but definitely really good and the service was phenomenal as well.</p>
<p>Came for happy hour on a Thursday around 4:30pm with a friend. Most tables and seats were full but the hostess found us a spot in their stand room area. Drinks: NA spritze - was good, sweet with a hint of bitterness wish this had a little more acidity to balance the sweetness but still enjoyable Food: Raw Oysters - fresh small to medium sized oysters with a slight salinity, served with lemon wedges, mignonette and hot sauce, there was a bit of shell and grit in some of the oysters Baked miso bone marrow oysters - really tasty, larger in size, creamy and rich with some fattiness from the bone marrow and savory umami from the miso Service was fine, pretty busy during happy hour but  servers came by regularly to check in. The hostess brought out water when we were first seated. Overall a decent spot for oyster happy hour. You can only order oysters and drinks in the bars standing area so if you want a full meal definitely grab a reservation.</p>
<p>I came here with my friends as a group of 4 for happy hour, right at opening time and got seated right away. Two of us came first to grab a table and the other two were still looking for parking but the waitress still let us sit down first which was really nice of them. When you step in you'll notice the nice interior with lots of Japanese decor. We ordered lots of food for the happy hour but my favorite was the karaage and gyoza for $5!! That is insane value for the portion they give you. The karaage was a good size and super juicy! The sauce provided is also delicious. Surprisingly another top item for me on the happy hour menu was the shiitake mushroom skewer which was seasoned perfectly! Outside of the happy hour menu, we also ordered the millionaire tonkotsu ramen. The soup was delicious, not too salty and the meat was chunky. I thought the noodles were too soft but other than that it was great!</p>
<p>This is for the happy hour. A really great happy hour! The Public Izakaya has a fantastic happy hour menu. It is from 5-6 pm and 10-11 pm. A friend and I came after Trevor Noah and it was the perfect time. Our server kindly allowed us to order off of the HH menu a few minutes before 10 pmFor happy hour, you can order any chicken and veggies skewers for $5! We ordered quite a few chicken skewers (heart, gizzard, liber, nankotsu) along with shitake mushroom. The portions were really decent and everything tasted delicious Also for $5 you can get a portion of the karaage and gyoza ($10 normally)Additionally, we got a the salmon and hamachi nigiri (2 piece for $5!!!!) . Smaller on size, but well worth for $5We really enjoyed our late night HH and the restaurant was packed! Guess we weren't the only ones with this good idea :)</p>
<p>6 Stars, Michelin ready! So nice to find a restaurant that understates and over-delivers in the U square area that sets tourist traps on every other corner. Quality raws, great drinks, and maybe the best bowl of soup I've ever had (Spicy Wagyu).Good service. Good value $. I will return with this now in the solid lineup for SF dining.</p>
<p>I went here for happy hour - their HH items are awesome! I was stunned at the portion of the chicken kaarage and gyoza - all for $5? Insane! The sashimi was amazing too. What a good deal!The vibe inside is very quirky with lots of interesting decoration. The tables are for 2-4 people with one larger table that could probably seat about 6-8. The service as good. I would definitely go here again!</p>
<p>Tasty inexpensive happy hour in a cute Japanese restaurant! We came on a Saturday night for happy hour (5-6pm) and were able to get a table immediately, although the restaurant quickly filled up. They have a small happy hour menu and we ordered almost everything on it! Our favorites were the saba tataki, baked mussels, and karaage+gyoza (huge portion, so worth it). Everything was delicious though! It's nice to split a bunch of the small dishes with a group or get a couple for yourself. The service was very quick and didn't rush us to leave either. The decor inside is really cute and the restaurant isn't too loud even when it's full. It's a little difficult to find parking since it's close to Union square but you just have to keep circling around and eventually will get street parking. I'd love to return for happy hour again!</p>
<p>In terms of izakayas, I'm pretty spoiled. Frequenting them with friends and family in Japan and trying various spots in Hawaiʻi is what I've become used to. Moving back to the Bay Area, the izakaya scene here isn't as spectacular, exceedingly pricier, and something that I tended to stay away from. My friend enjoyed her previous experience here and wanted to come back together; I thought it was mediocre.I've passed by Public Izakaya numerous times throughout the city. Izakayas are a place to sit, stay, and drink--which is what most customers do here. I found the ambiance to remind me of a small Japanese bar. There's a lot of Japanese decor, Japanese music, and dim lights surrounding patrons. The restaurant is cramped yet spacious--mostly with tables for pairs and a few for larger groups. I found service to be lackluster throughout our dinner. We were checked in on in the beginning but as it got busier we weren't helped as much. Our food also took some time to come out.One thing about this restaurant is the menu is limitless. They have everything from appetizers, rice dishes, noodles, sushi, sashimi, and yakitori. I wanted to order something that I knew I enjoyed and couldn't find at many restaurants--yakitori. For their yakitori, it comes with two pieces. Along with chicken, you can get beef, pork, seafood, and vegetables. I got their Chicken Thigh, Tsukune, and Pork Belly. The skewers were grilled decently. The tsukune was simple, meaty, and as a chicken meatball would taste--loved adding the egg yolk for a savory taste. The thigh was nothing spectacular just plain and moist. The pork belly was succulent and juicy, though some parts were a bit too fatty. My friend chose their Salt and Pepper Nonkatsu and Millionaires Ramen. She liked the former but said the latter was pretty tasteless. I feel that dishes here can be a hit or miss. If you're interested in trying various Japanese-inspired bar bites and dishes, this is a relatively affordable and sufficient choice--especially during their early and late happy hour. The restaurant is off of Post Street and parking is limited to the street but close to public transportation. This wouldn't be a place I'd come back to knowing what a true izakaya is like, but for visitors or locals looking for a place to gather and get small bites, I see why it's popular.</p>
<p>Total gem in Lower Nob Hill! Really great food, great portions, reasonable prices, and cozy atmosphere. It took us quite a bit of time to order because the menu is expansive and there are many unique items to pick from, but the staff was patient and helpful. The green gyoza were a solid start, but our mains definitely stole the show. I got the beef curry which was delicious, hearty and reminded me a bit of my Mom's curry; the meat was super tender. My friend enjoyed the galbi. Then we shared the shrimp and lobster roll which was massive! Tons and tons of tempura shrimp and onion piled onto sushi rolls topped with lobster tail. It was delicious and honestly quite fun to eat. Desserts looked delicious but we were plenty full. Would love to come back myself and would recommend to all!</p>
<p>Love this place! I have come here twice now, and I really liked the vibes and the food here. When you check in on Yelp, you can get a free beer which pairs nicely with the food and complements the mood of the place. The food is very good and comforting. My favorites are actually the pork belly of the classic skewer sampler and the Tonkotsu ramen. I am normally not the biggest fan of ramen because ramen is normally too salty, but I really liked this ramen. The Korean fried chicken doesn't seem the most authentic but is still really filling. The Big Mouth was very good but is more on the pricey side.The service here is very nice and standard. This restaurant seems to be sister restaurants with Chome. Both have a happy hour, and I want to come back one night to check out the happy hour!</p>
<p>This place is more of a 3.5 stars.We came by around 10:45pm? And got seated right away last night. Saw this place was open until 2am so that was great! It did get packed by the time we sat down, maybe it's because veteran day was tomorrow (aka today), or people just wanted to eat late at night.The service was good. The server told us that there will be last call for happy hour which we really appreciated that he told us as it ends at 11pm. We got the fried oysters and the $10 roll. The fried oysters were really good, came with dipping sauce. However, the roll was subpar. It was kind of mushy? But maybe kitchen was rushing the orders as it became packed. My friends got udon and another noodle dish and they said it was good but not great. I might try what they recommend or what's popular here if I decide to come here again. This is a smaller restaurant but the decorations are nice - from top to bottom. They even had candy in those little baskets next to the xmas tree. FYI they do have 2 happy hours, 1 from 5-6pm and 1 from 10-11pm!</p>
<p>We were visiting SF for a show at the Masonic down the street and had some time to grab some dinner beforehand and we fell in love with the vibe and food here! Service was super friendly and helpful and the food itself was all fantastic. I'm usually hesitant to get sushi anywhere it's not the main focus but all things considered, the quality was great. You get a free Sapporo for checking in on Yelp too, so don't miss out on that, it's a great deal! We especially loved the unagi rice bowl, it was fantastic!</p>
<p>My friends and I stopped by a few weeks ago for their late night Happy Hour and it was an epic fail. Instead of dining on a budget and ordering from the Happy Hour menu, we ordered from the regular menu and ran up an epic bill totaling over $80 a person. Oof! Because the Happy Hour menu is so budget friendly, the place gets extremely crowded, and the service is quite slow as well. Don't expect 5 star service and amenities here. Paper menus are used and they've had their fair share of spilled beer and sauce stains on them.That said... the food here on the regular menu is not bad, especially the fried shrimp heads (two pieces for $16). Standard Japanese bar fare like chicken karage is breaded lightly and not oily tasting. The nigiri here is nothing special. As it gets extremely toasty in the restaurant in the tiny space without any windows open, I'd recommend finishing the nigiri shortly after it arrives so it doesn't get grossly warm.Other than late-night Korean fried chicken spots nearby, I don't believe there are many options for late-night Asian food.I would give Public Izakaya another try, but will definitely order exclusively off the Happy Hour menu since that's where the true value is.</p>
<p>Great food, weird service. We were seated after a brief moment on the wait list, and ordered garlic noodles, green beans, and the veggies skewer combo. We also got the Sapporo Yelp check-in special, which was a nice touch but not for the treatment at the end. The food came out sporadically, green beans first, the noodles next, then the skewer combo.When we finished our food, none of the 3 waiters (2 women, one man) on the floor took notice. We get they were busy but they made it their priority to attend to the people (all white men at that point) off the waitlist and get their orders. At one point I got up and left, leaving my partner to pay, and even that didn't get any waiter's attention. In fact she had to wait an additional 20 minutes, before she went up to the counter to pay. The party next to us were got their check first, even had their table wiped down, although we had finished earlier. My partner's first ever experience of not tipping.</p>
<p>Came here for happy hour and it was pretty good for the price! Got here right when they opened on a Friday afternoon and within 30 minutes, they already had people lining up outside so make sure to get here early! The restaurant is relatively small in size and has some retro themed decors. We got the salmon, hamachi, tuna, and bluefin toro nigiri and they were all good and $5 for 2 pieces except for the bluefin toro which was $10. The karaage and gyoza ($5) were also pretty good and I really liked the dipping sauce. However, I don't recommend their fresh oysters ($10) at all. They were super fishy and not cleaned well.</p>
<p>Food: 4/5Our meal included a selection of dishes, with some notable highlights. The monkfish liver was an absolute standout, offering a rich and delightful flavor that truly impressed. Likewise, the chiraishi don was a delightful combination of fresh ingredients that made for a satisfying meal.However, there was a slight hiccup with the chicken karaage. It lacked the desired juiciness, and the breading didn't achieve the ideal level of crunchiness, leaving it somewhat underwhelming. It seems that this restaurant does have some good sushi and very good items, but fails in some of the fundamentals (such as the chicken karaage).Atmosphere: 5/5The atmosphere at The Public Izakaya was truly exceptional. The restaurant's cute decor added a charming and cozy touch to the dining experience, creating a welcoming and enjoyable ambiance. Something that was pretty cute were the snacks and little candy available in the restaurant.Service: 5/5The service was a positive aspect of our visit. The staff was attentive and courteous throughout our meal, contributing to a pleasant dining experience. Additionally, the Yelp check-in bonus for a free beer was a pleasant surprise and added value to our visit.Overall:The Public Izakaya is a worthy dining option with some notable highlights in its menu, such as the monkfish liver and chiraishi don. The charming atmosphere greatly enhances the dining experience, and the service was generally commendable. While there was a minor disappointment with the chicken karaage, the overall experience was positive. If you're in the mood for Japanese cuisine in a cozy and welcoming setting, it's worth a visit, especially if you can take advantage of Yelp promotions like the free beer offer.</p>
<p>Came here with friends after a concert around 11pm! There was a long wait because we came during their happy hour. I don't know if it was the drunchies but this place HIT. SUPER KIMCHI REMIX (5/5)* Kimchi fried rice can either be a hit or a miss, so I was kinda skeptical. Surprisingly, there was bulgogi in it! I also enjoyed how fluffy and soft the omelette was. I thought that was unique compared to the usual fried egg. PHILLY CHEESE UNAGI ROLL (3.8/5)* One of the more fancier rolls here and honestly, it was just decent. Like it was good, but not worth almost $20 good.SAKE TORO OYAKO DON (3/5)* Beautiful presentation, but it was alright. Felt like the don was too sweet. SIMPLE ROLLS: NEGI HAMACHI & SALMON AVOCADO (5/5)* We got 2 simple rolls and loved them more than the fancy rolls. The fish here is great quality. The hamachi roll was our favorite because it was so buttery! THAI TEA (5/5)* IT WAS SO GOOD. I literally drank my drink so fast. I wished I had more.Great late night drinking spot with the homies, I'd come again.</p>
<p>Came here on a Friday night and were quickly seated. It's a small spot but they managed arrangement to fit quite a few tables. The downside is that you're seated pretty close to the next table and you can hear their whole conversation even when you try not to.We ordered the:- Mentaiko Udon: tasted great and the uni was a nice touch. Only wish the portion was bigger- Chirashi Bowl: it was a small bowl and the fish didn't taste as fresh. Slightly disappointed- Fried Calamari: decent and no complaints Despite the smaller portions, the prices were decent. Service was quick. Interior decor was a nice touch. 2 restrooms inside. Would come again to try their other dishes if I was in the area.</p>
<p>I love this place. One of very few restaurants that is open till 2 AM. The staff is wonderful and it has a great service. No matter how busy they are they always smile and you never have to wait long for the orders. Not a place for kids please don't bring kids. Great for small business dinner or date night. Everything on the menu is</p>
<p>Awesome place to hang out at, and it is open late! The sushi was good, but I think the appetizers are where they really shine, and will be trying more next time. The string beans were amazing, and so were the garlic noodles. The cheesy oxtail was a bit of a let down, we got more bone than meat. The fancy rolls we got were very good, and the simple rolls were solid. Prices were great, but the rolls were small. Service was not very attentive, but overall we were satisfied, and I am looking forward to coming back for their late night happy hour (10-11 pm). The complimentary candy bar was a nice touch!</p>
<p>This place is open late which is perfect for a night out. We dropped by with a group of 5 around 1130pm and thankfully they had some seating available. Excellent food options and great vibes. Food came out quickly so there wasn't much of a wait. Definitely recommend dropping by if you're looking for some late night.</p>
<p>It was mediocre honestly but one of the few places that open so late and serve Japanese food. Three stars for this alone:)We had a bunch of diff appetizers as we were really hungry. The purple sweet potato fries were disappointing. But everything else were not bad. I wouldn't crave for it but I don't hate it either.</p>
<p>A gem that delivers big on taste and heart.  The chefs / couple are clearly talented and very passionate about what they serve.  The deviled egg was a great starter.  The Chawanmushi steamed egg was one of my personal favorites, topped with their homemade XO sauce.  No surprise the ramen stole the show --  balanced and noodles were perfection.  It was inspiring hearing their story and I hope to be back soon to taste what's next.</p>
<p>Came here in early August and made reservations via Tock that drop monthly. * financier with caviar - sweet, smoked shoyu. Like a sweet lox bagel bite. * Chawanmushi with XO sauce - shrimp was sweet. The egg is made with ramen tare for deep flavor. XO sauce was fun texture with the silky egg. Not your average chawanmushi. * Three eggs carbonara - carbo-nabura soba. Made with pasta flour. There was some konbu dashi. Garlic brown butter. Shoyu and shio tare. Shoyu made with oysters. Topped with a soy cured egg. * Tomato salad - peeled sun gold tomatoes. Fromage blanc cheese. Mala spicy sauce. Dashi gelee. Salad dressing made of vegetables. Shiso leaves on top. * 16 hour pork belly braised karaage - with marinated shiso leaves. * Yuzu daikon pickle* Cucumbers - made with salt sugar shio konbu. My favorite palette cleanser of the night. * Shio butter clam ramen - clam meat "ice cream". Hokkaido scallop. Konbu butter compound. 6 hour Pork neck collar chashu. As the butter melts, the broth changes from a clean clam broth to a creamy rich seafood broth. * yuzu shaved ice with golden kiwi preserve and almond jelly. With apricot seed extract. The shaved ice machine they use is from Japan and the texture is definitely different than the normal shaved ice. * Doraiyaki - white peach. Double brewed shoyu and mochi flower in the batter. Brown butter cookie crumble and white peach in the center. Delicious with great balance. The dining experience is very intimate and you get to learn a lot about how much thought and effort goes into their menu. For example, the noodles in their shio butter clam ramen being a collaboration with their noodle maker. They have a great sake selection and I would definitely try their sake pairing next time since the selection seemed like a lot that I haven't seen before. This is my second time at Noodle in a Haystack and I'll definitely be back!</p>
<p>The meals was just wonderful and mouthwatering. Every bite was umami filled. The chefs are as kind as they are skilled. Hope to have the opportunity to dine in their wonderful and intimate establishment soon!</p>
<p>Clearly, a lot of people love this place so  Im going to be the odd man out.  I totally get the passion here but for me, this was a huge let down.  Its a fixed menu with a couple appetizers and a the main course of ramen.  The apps were quite nice.  One dish was made of several small A5 pieces just lightly charred by torch.  The main was a dan dan style ramen.  It looked delicious.  Unfortunately it was so crazy spicy that I could not eat it.  It just burnt my mouth to such a degree that I could not taste anything.  After a few bites, I had to leave the rest.  Given that its a fixed menu there were no other options for me and I left quite hungry.  Very unfortunate especially the price point.  From reading other reviews they seem to change out dishes frequently.  Hopefully, when you go, you either like really spicy, or they have a different option for you.</p>
<p>Summary:So much more than just fancy ramenDetails:For the uninitiated, Noodle in a Haystack has been around for many years now, originally operating as a ramen-focused popup at various venues, with reservations that were largely impossible for most to get. Since those early days, the business has evolved significantly, with Clint and Yoko opening up their own brick and mortar space (after many a bureaucratic roadblock), reservations being marginally easier to get (you have a ~15 minute window now instead of ~30 seconds), and the menu having turned into something more akin to kaiseki (though still built around a star noodle dish, of course).I was lucky to nab a last minute opening during their soft launch month, and got to see and taste the fruits of their labor, as my girlfriend and I were treated to a bevy of courses: some, significantly more stellar than others, but all enjoyable in some form, and each presented with a bit of fanfare and background from the couple themselves. While the main noodle (a wagyu aburasoba the day we went) itself was obviously one of the star dishes, their caviar financier, kakuni karaage, and annin kakigori were also particularly outstanding.Absolutely worth a shot if you can snag a reservation. And while $225 after included tax and tip is certainly a steep price for ramen, it's more palatable if you think of it in terms of a tasting menu at a Michelin star restaurant, with the same expectation of care and quality put into the dishes.Accessibility:The space is a bit smaller and comprised of bar counter seating only, but they specifically designed a wheelchair accessible portion with a lower counter towards the far end!</p>
<p>I was luckily able to go to one of the extended special 10 course dinners with sake pairings last Friday. What a fantastic meal! I loved every single dish and that isn't even an exaggeration. I continue to be amazed by how Clint and Yoko continue to hone their craft and create such impeccable dishes.The last time I visited, Clint mentioned they were thinking about changing up their first course after having it be the deviled egg for so many years. I was really excited to see what it was replaced with and the financier did not disappoint. What a perfect bite! The firefly squid with a little chili kick was such a good balance. I could not get enough of that uni/shrimp/monkfish liver/seaweed/rice cracker course, one of my faves. The homemade smoked chashu might be the best chashu I have ever had. The bf was so excited to see white asparagus (which reminded him of when he lived in Germany where it's more common), and he ate all of his scallops as well which is a sign of how good that particular dish was because I often get some of his scallop since he has a very mild allergy to them but when I peeked at his dish, they were already all gone haha. The wagyu katsu sando paired with the pickles was another one of my favorite dishes. Deciding to katsu the bread instead of the meat was really creative and worked super well. The crab ramen was great; really glad to be able to have it before crab season ends. The shaved ice and almond tofu was so refreshing after dinner and not too sweet (the best dessert compliment haha). The basque cheesecake with a light coffee flavor was also divine. Perfect meal from start to finish!Oh and all of the sakes were great as well. Nice variety and just the right quantity.</p>
<p>I have been in love with Noodle in a Haystack and Clint & Yoko since 2016 and I am so happy I finally got to eat at their new restaurant. To be honest, I was unsure when the restaurant would open, but it was definitely worth the wait! The open faced chef's table-esque kitchen and modern/sleek design is extremely welcoming and the lighting is great for photos. I didn't tell Clint & Yoko this, but this was one of my first meals after recovering from food poisoning so I was unsure if I was going to even enjoy it, but oh boy, was this one of my favorite meals of the year. I can talk about all of the dishes in detail, but here are some of my favorites: +Japanese Avocado Toast - Mashed avocado with smoked trout on top of a deep fried donut hole. Finished with finger limes and a cold pressed African Green Chilli oil. This was magical... +Spanish blue fin toro tar tar tart - Toro on top of a tart? Got to love that ingenuity! Inspired by a sushi roll, they top it off with a regular pickle, smoked pickle, and shishito leaf. +Wagyu Abura Ramen - First of all, can we talk about the noodles they are using? Wagyu, wagyu butter, and those beautiful noodles. Come on! I mean come on! I am drooling just thinking about this. This was the star. I could have eaten a couple bowls of this. Also, Clint & Yoko are some of the nicest people I have ever met and it brings me so much joy to eat their food in such a beautiful space. For $150 a person, you get at least 7-8 courses and an intimate dining experience. They are rotating their menu and experimenting with local and seasonal ingredients so my experience will probably be different from the next person, but it is definitely worth trying out if you can snag a reservation!</p>
<p>All dishes were fantastic! Best chawanmushi and ramen I've had by far! Atmosphere is also very nice, great music, intimate setting, courses came out promptly. The chefs and Pearl were so inviting, informative, and are very genuine people! My husband and I had a great time here and would definitely recommend!</p>
<p>I had a phenomenal dining experience at Noodle in a Haystack! One glance at the name and you'd immediately think that it's just a ramen shop, but there are SO many layers here. It's an omakase and ramen shop with Asian fusion vibes and a monthly ramen style. They're constantly experimenting with new recipes, so the menu is always changing. The 8 courses ($125/person) were rich with flavor, umami, and creativity. While the star of the show was definitely the beautifully crafted and delicious ramen, the other food elements still lingered in my mind. My taste buds were dancing because I was transported back to my time in Japan.BONUS: Clint and Yoko are super sweet, kind, thoughtful, and knowledgeable! They initially ran their pop-up around the Bay Area, but the Kickstarter project helped bring their dream of opening a shop in SF to life. The current seating arrangement allows each guest to easily communicate with them. Clint explained each dish (and fun facts) with immaculate detail. They also have a special Pi-water filter!Note that this restaurant has no defined menu, so the items below might not be the same when you visit. However, there will probably be variations of these items. Either way, you won't be disappointed :) 1. Avocado toast with chili olive oil: Bite-sized bread with avocado. It looks really simple, but the acidity and flavor were very balanced.2. Rice crackers with uni and mix of fresh fish: The rice crackers brings me back to my childhood. The uni and fish were incredibly fresh and creamy. I need more of this in my life. 3. Kanpachi with ponzu sauce: Great ponzu sauce with a nice crunch from the onions!4. Chilled tofu: The sauce was inspired by tantanmen and mala, so you'll get a nice kick of umami. It was so smooth.5. 16-hour braised pork belly: WOW, the best pork belly that I've ever had. It literally MELTED in my mouth. Smooth like butter *cues BTS song* :) This gave me KBBQ vibes because of the meat + salad combo.6. Radish and pickled vegetables (shared between 2 people): So refreshing and tasty! I'd love to have this on the side at all times.7. Abura soba ramen: THE best ramen I've ever had and on the same wavelength as the best ramen places in Japan. This gave me Mi Goreng vibes, but amplified x1000. The onions were sweet and mild without the spicy onion flavor. Their wagyu butter and wagyu fat mousse in the sauce were divine. Soak the noodles with the orange egg yolk for some extra creamy flavor. It was SO FREAKING DELICIOUS.8. Almond jello with kiwi and shaved ice: Great way to end the night with super light dessert!</p>
<p>We started trying to get reservations for this place in 2019 and finally got them in 2020, but unfortunately with the pandemic it got pushed several times. After 2 whole years we were finally able to reschedule for their kickstarter and it was well worth the long wait. This restaurant is super intimate with just 8-12 seating and there's only 3 staff members including Yoko and Clint. Throughout our dinner, we were able to hear about their journey in opening their new space and unfortunately, they're actually not allowed to have a full kitchen setup due to permit issues. We saw them using portable burners to cook the ramen and a toaster oven to heat up their proteins. However, with that said, it's still amazing what they can create even with limited resources available. We got our reservations with the Wagyu Abura Soba and our meal consisted of  7 courses. It included appetizers, small dishes/palette cleansers, ramen, and dessert. Each course was delicious in their own ways and it was actually more food than I anticipated. I was stuffed by the end of the meal and I ended up giving some of my ramen to my bf to finish because I wanted to save room for dessert. It's definitely hard to get reservations here, but definitely keep trying because it's so worth it. For the quality of their craft and ingredients, I agree with another yelper and can foresee them getting a Michelin Star somewhere in the future. Hoping they will reopen their reservations again soon so we can come back!</p>
<p>I originally had reservations for this pre-pandemic pop-up celebrating home-made Japanese noodles for March 13, 2020. In the two-and-a-half years since my aborted reservation, the restaurant found a brick-and-mortar location and appears to have developed a singular vision of how to elevate a college-food staple to fine dining extravagance.Every ingredient is steamed, frozen, puréed, broiled, grilled, whatever, all in an effort to stun the palate. Even sesame seeds and lettuce are intentional choices to highlight the husband-and-wife chefs' creativity.It's still a soft opening, and the regular kinks of post-pandemic dining out persist, but this is a restaurant doing something no one else is doing and doing it impressively.</p>
<p>Truly an amazing and unique meal! Clint and Yoko have really innovated on a set cuisine around ramen and taken their passion and dedication to a whole new level. I was blown away with their thoughtfulness and hearing about the history of how their dishes came to be through multiple iterations, discovery and adjustments - whimsical but also very purposeful in trying to achieve the best outcome possible. They are both so engaging, down to earth and welcoming. We will be back for sure to see what they come up with next season!クリントとようこさんごち様でした！本当にありがとございました^_^</p>
<p>To tell you about this place, I literally never heard of them before I saw them on the social media and really interested to try out their ramen since I'm a ramen lover. But they have just opened the shop just a few months ago and before that they were just doing pop-up. So I tried to find a way to get a reservation and you could make it on Tock. I was on the waitlist and luckily, I got a seats. So let's talk about the restaurant and food now.The restaurant has no sign and it's really new. Clean looks and only table seating. I got there early and got to seated first. Nice counter bar. We got the beverage menu and order the sake pairing.First : the devils egg with crispy chicken skins and salmon roe Second : tofu with tomato like caprese saladThird : sashimi Hawaiian amberjackFourth : tofu crab with Uni Fifth : deep fried pork belly saladSixth : housemade ramen noodle Seventh : shaved ice Overall: food was good but only little things that could be improved such as the temperature and the fat of the beef was chewy. Service was very friendly but with the price of 125$ that you could also go enjoy at some Michelin star. Still need to step up a little bit. Looking forward to come back again though when they change the menu.</p>
<p>So happy to be able to support Noodle in a Haystack from day 1. Clint and Yoko are the only people bringing Michelin quality ramen to San Francisco and everyone needs to know about it. You can tell each dish is crafted with so much care and thought. From the first course ramen egg (a standard dish from pop-up days) to the star abura soba/ramen with custom noodles to the last shaved yuzu ice/kiwi almond pudding (amazing iteration of the shaved yuzu ice!). Run, don't walk, or you'll miss your chance!</p>
<p>Finally found time to have our kickstarter meal. Such a great experience and nice to see Clint and Yoko in their new modern space.Pork belly and ramen were the standouts but every course was meticulous and wonderful. Thanks guys for a wonderful experience and look forward to coming back soon.</p>
<p>I first met Clint and Yoko years ago when they were hosting Noodle in a Haystack as a pop-up in their home and I have been a big fan ever since. So naturally, I was so excited for them when they decided to open a ramen-focused restaurant and happily backed their Kickstarter! The intimate dining experience was excellent. Clint and Yoko are a seamless team, effortlessly engaging with their guests while at the same time assembling each dish right before your eyes.  All of the dishes in their pre fixe menu have a ramen theme, whether through creative uses of ingredients or fun injections of familiar ramen flavors. We ordered a nice bottle of sake, which paired perfectly with the meal. The space has an elegant minimalistic vibe, which only makes the food and plating stand out even more! The whole dining experience was just so fun! I can't wait to see how the menu changes over time and can't wait to come back!</p>
<p>It was yummy and some dishes were creative, but really not worth the price nor hype in my opinion. For $150 pp I would expect to be blown away. Their chili oil wasn't even homemade. I've had a 10 course kaiseki at that price in comparison. They're good people, I wish them all the success in perfecting their craft. Try it for yourself! But maybe just the one time.</p>
<p>Noodleina Haystack, the main ramen concept restaurantIt's not just ramen, it's the Omakase menu.It's gorgeous!!! Every dish is delicious!a drop of soupThere's no juice left!The restaurant is run by a married couple. The male chef used to cook ramen in Japan.First place in the race. The cook was good at baking, so the couple worked together.The restaurant looks small but it's big inside.There is no open fire in the open kitchen.The dishes will show up in front of you one by one.show, and people are super nice.Ramen is the highlight! It's got some mochirice in it.So it's a little more resilient than traditional Japanese ramen.$130 Menu: 6-8 course menu$180 Menu: Chef's Choice Menu$275 Menu: 10 courses (including 1 treasure)+ A5 and beef sandwiches) + Five types of chefs keep sake.Cooks try different models every month, such as the April HKCEE.Considering two performances in the evening during the week, sake sharing will continue on the weekend.</p>
<p>Clint & Yoku congratulations finally had the chance to try the non soft opening menu and it was so good, but I still need to try the extended menu . If you can book a spot and enjoy, the hard work they pull into each dish shows even the dinner ware they source. Food for each menu varies so it's hard for me to tell you what to expect,the one only thing I can say is delicious and come with a open mind</p>
<p>Delicious and great conversation! Loved all the dishes and especially the ones photoed. Meal is timed well.</p>
