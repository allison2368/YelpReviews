      "   Reviews: ['Went to Bottega for a date night and let me tell you it was amazing. Had a reservation so did not have to wait long, once seated the waiter attended to us right away and we were able to order. Food is amazing and so fresh! Drinks were good too. Highly recommend for a cute little date night.', \"Everything was great! Food, menu options, staff & vibe. It's nice to have a traditional Italian restaurant that isn't stuffy or way over priced\", 'Had the best dinner here. Frank was very helpful and attentive to all our needs. Even before we ask it. Ambiance was great and colorful. The vibe was upbeat  and chill', \"Bottega surprisingly had dishes that seemed unique to other italian restaurants I've been to. The interior was pretty dark and they actually have these table lamps that they turn on for you, with just a bit of ambiance on the ceilings and walls. I got a seat with my two friends in the back corner so I didn't have too much incentive to look around. It was the day before Thanksgiving so maybe we got really lucky with the timing and managed to get a seat. By the time we were done, the restaurant was about to fill up.Their complimentary bread is very good. If I go to a restaurant and I enjoy their bread, it speaks volumes from my perspective. They have dried tomato in some of the pieces which adds a light kick. Olive oil on the side if thats your thing.I got the salmon fettuccine and it was pleasantly soft to bite into the salmon. Most of the time I get a salmon dish at italian restaurant, I often get displeased that the fish has been cooked too long. Then again, not my recipe. They add this sauce which they refer to as 'pink' and I'd say it makes the whole dish creamier. Not too bland, and not too overpowering. Really enjoyed it. I didn't try the other dishes but I didn't even recognize that my friend got ravioli so A+ for how their dishes stand out! The two tables next to me had my head turned every so often to look at the dish they ordered.I'd say if you are in the area and are craving some italian food, definitely try this spot out! I'd come again on a date for sure. The service here is excellent as well since they often come to check up on you.\", \"This place is a solid 4.5 with a perfect experience and good food! They don't take reservations, so it's usually just a wait, but luckily on a Sunday night, there was no wait. Sara was our waitress and was very nice, and she knew all about the food, joked around, and gave us good recommendations. The atmosphere is darker and intimate, but also very lively despite not having a wait, so it was definitely a place that people seem to enjoy! I have been here before, but did enjoy it the first time so wanted to try it out again (looks like I forgot to review this place the first time!)They gave complimentary bread as starters, and you could easily get lost finishing it while waiting for your food. Not sure how fresh the bread actually is, but it was buttered and warm. We ordered the Sacchetti and the Quattro Formaggi Roman pizza, and I was so surprised that this place actually split the pasta into two dishes for you to share! The Sacchetti is unlike anything I have tried before, and would say it is one of the dishes to try here to see what it's like. They are like tortellini/ravioli filled with cheese with hints of sweetness like pear, and then with some walnuts to add a sense of earthiness and crunch. It fills your mouth with all textures and flavors, and really does feel like a balanced pasta dish even though the ingredients are so simple! The Roman pizza was also very nice, a great amount of cheese but still with distinct flavors from the different cheeses they use. For dessert, we got the Tiramisu which I thought the cream was great, but just felt on the dryer side as it felt like the lady fingers could have been soaked more like you would have for a classic tiramisu. Last time I came here, I remember getting a pink sauce pasta, but that was on the tangy side and not something that I really remember, so I need to try it again next time I come to give a proper review of it. But the portion sizes were good and the service was great!Overall I think this is a solid modern Italian place in SF! I think the food and atmosphere is great to continue to visit again and again, and I don't think I'll find a dish like the Sacchetti anywhere else!\", 'I highly recommend a daytime visit to Bottega to immerse yourself in its enchanting interior, featuring captivating pink hues, wood finishes, rose gold accents, cascading flowers, and exposed brick--a perfect backdrop for dressing up and capturing beautiful moments.The food was yummy, and my friends enjoyed their meals too. I ordered garlic bread which was perfectly seasoned -- not too much, or too little. I also enjoyed my gnocchi with pesto sauce.  The pesto sauce was made into a perfectly creamy blend and not oily/greasy. Gnocchi can oftentimes be a rich and heavy dish, but they somehow made it light. The service was kind, and attentive. My water glass was always full. We were regularly offered refills of complimentary bread, and this bread was so soft, warm, and flavorful. It was a highlight on its own for me. Additionally, the wait staff surprised me with a happy birthday song, and panna cotta with a candle. Sooo thoughtful, and brought a smile to my face. Thank you!', \"This is truly a beautiful restaurant with gorgeous pink hues and floral accents.The complimentary bread, a rare treat nowadays, was quite good. Our waiter made ordering our meals such a breeze by offering  insightful recommendations. I opted for the Mezzemaniche Boscaiola with pink sauce, it was so delicious! The staff's thoughtful gesture of singing Happy Birthday for my friend's birthday and presenting a complimentary panna cotta added a thoughtful and sweet touch to the overall experience.\", \"I mean... come on, if you walk pass this place, you are instantly sucked in by the open concept giving you a full view of their bar and alcohol selection with the aromas of delicious food being cooked and served. Bottega has always been recommended by my coworkers so I had an opportunity to take the family a few weeks back. Nicky, our server, was so welcoming by treating us like we were regulars. She made recommendations, told us the special of the day, and also took note of our daughter's food allergies. Kids were being basic yet again, ordering a pasta with butter and another one with meatballs. My wife and I shared calamari fritti, lasagna and they were kind enough to split the branzino for us. Food was fantastic with the branzino being the highlight of our dining experience. Fish was cooked to perfection, capers and potatoes were a nice touch, and everything was seasoned perfectly! I would come back just for this!Cocktails were tasty and beautiful... solid wine selection as well! Thank you Nicky for making us feel so welcomed!\", \"Ordered to go on Yelp so unsure of ambiance. Delivered fast. I did the build your own pasta. I did the rigatoni with garlic, chicken, and pink pasta. The pasta was Al dente for sure. Barely taste the garlic: chicken was dry. Pink pasta sauce taste store bought like or like frozen food. The second one was the Ravioli, garlic, mushroom, onion, Italian sausage, and bolognese sauce. Ravioli is good. Didn't see any onions and i paid extra, barely 4 slices piece of mushroom and paid $2 extra, no garlic flavor,  but there was a lot of Italian sausage pieces. Sausage is bland. The sauce basically taste like spaghetti O ravioli sauce the one you can buy at Walmart. Most likely would never order from here again. Doesn't taste fresh, authentic, or has much flavor. Didn't come with utensils, so make sure to ask for it.\", \"This is my favorite place to get pasta in the city or to order on DoorDash! It's so aesthetic, perfect for dinner out with the girlies or date night. Depending on when you come, there may or may not be a wait. There is an option to add yourself onto the Yelp waitlist remotely which is convenient. We always get wine to pair with our dinner. My two go-to pastas are the:*amatriciana: the spicy tomato sauce with the guanciale is so good; the perfect combination of spiciness with warm pasta*mezzemaniche boscaiola with pink sauce: the pink sauce is so creamy and flavorfulParking wise, it can be a little difficult to find street parking. There's also metered parking all around. It's overall a cute spot in the mission to try out!\", 'No Fees']\n",

Great spot!', \"Ambience was amazing 10/10 so classy clean modern, service was very welcoming, fast and beautifully put together, best of all the food I had was delicious, I orders the filet mingon best steak I've had\", \"I live just around the corner in Marina and wanted to try this new spot. Don't let the lack of guests inside steer you away (it's brand new) -- This food was EXCELLENT. Some of the best I've had along Chesnut Street. And the servers were incredibly attentive and kind.\", \"Excellent service!! Came here for my birthday with a group of friends. I highly recommend this restaurant. The crew sang happy birthday for me and provided a yummy dessert. The food was amazing! I had the grilled salmon. They also have a huge selection of wine. Alina and Berry served us and they were wonderful. The ambiance is very nice and classy. It's perfect for a birthday dinner where you can dress up and take pictures after.\", \"It was such a great experience! Seems like they just opened a few weeks ago, and we would highly recommend! Everything from decor to food to service to location and the restrooms were on point. We sat outside, and it was the most beautiful sunny day to dine outdoors. Esvet was so awesome! We got the beef meatballs, linguini, beet salad and key lime pie. I hear the pie is a 20yr old recipe, and it definitely didn't disappoint. Soooo yum! Coming back for the bread pudding next.\", \"Wonderful restaurant and experience in the Marina.  Ambience is great (although it is a bit noisy - just FYI).  Very pretty restaurant with comfortable chairs and great location!Service was impeccable!  Everyone was extremely nice, servers were attentive and the timing was perfect.Food was very good.  We started with the prawn appetizer, I had the salmon and Mr. had the linguini.  Judging by the way he scarfed that down, I would say it was a winner!  Salmon was good along the yummy vegetables served with it.  The prices are not bad either.  Most entrees are in the 20-30.00 range.  The starters and salads are less than 20.00.  Next time I would love to try their beet salad and skirt steak so we'll be back!\", \"We happened to be walking by looking for a lunch spot this Sunday and noticed this new beauty! They opened two weeks ok just off Chestnut street on Steiner. The gorgeous interior decor and furniture  caught my eye. We essentially ordered the entire starter menu minus the prawns . The most delicious item was (allegedly) a butternut squash gnocchi, but tasted more like a delicious Alfredo to me! Pasta was cooked perfectly. Wish I didn't have to share it ;pThe boys really enjoyed the steak tartare despite and exorbitant amount of cheese on it. The calamari was sadly inedible- super dry and cheery. Berry our awesome server kindly removed it from our bill on her own. Burrata heirloom salad was good! Just feel like plating should be reconsidered. Each tomato slice was pretty huge and somewhat awakes to cut. Meatball was a hit as well, delicious sauce. They serve wine and beer as well and I could not stop loving the flower ceiling we had outside. For just their second week up and running, they nailed it. Will definitely return!\", \"We had a great time at Bagatella for dinner. The restaurant is beautiful inside, and our server was friendly and attentive. To start, they provide complimentary house-made bread with truffle butter. We ordered the steak tartare, broccolini, pan seared chicken breast, and seafood linguini. Everything was delicious, but the standout was the steak tartare, which was some of the best we've had in the city. We will definitely be back for that dish alone. They also provided a key lime pie on the house for dessert, which was such a nice touch and a very delicious end to the meal. This definitely a great date night spot, and somewhere I'd take friends for a more intimate dinner.\", \"Ambiance is super cute, great for lunch and/or date nights. The staff is very accommodating and attentive, they will keep your glass filled and your stomach full. Food is delicious, I had the penne chicken (not pictured because I got hungry), everyone enjoyed the roasted chicken, salmon, and the steak. Everything's was cooked to perfection, you can tell that this business truly cares and they check on you to make sure that you're well taken care of. I'll definitely be back with friends, family, dates. Thank you for hosting our party and making it a great experience for us!\", \"Title: A Culinary Gem in SF Marina - Bagatella Shines Bright!Review:From the moment I stepped into Bagatella, the new culinary sensation in SF Marina, I knew it was going to be an extraordinary experience. It wasn't just a meal; it was a journey through exquisite flavors and aromas. The wine selection was nothing short of impressive, featuring a splendid array of choices that could satisfy even the most discerning oenophile. The food was a masterpiece, each dish beautifully presented and bursting with flavors that spoke of attention to detail and a passion for culinary excellence. Whether it was the perfectly seared scallops or the robust flavors of their signature pasta, every bite was a delight.Service at Bagatella was impeccable. The staff struck a fine balance between professionalism and warmth, making us feel both valued and pampered. Their recommendations were spot-on, enhancing our dining experience significantly.It's the little things that often make a big difference, and Bagatella's attention to detail was evident in everything from the ambiance to the perfectly timed courses.

Vegetarian friendly. I\\'d recommend going with a group so you can share multiple dishes!', \"Came here for lunch with a fiend on a Saturday and had their lunch special: drink, appetizer, entree.Fantastic food! The chicken pho was so comforting. The broken rice plate was an amazing sampling of several delicious items: charbroiled chicken, pork, and beef with lots of fresh herbs and nuoc cham.Ambiance is quite chic and charming. Great for a date or a birthday dinner.Can't wait to come back for dinner!Service was so friendly. Servers answered questions about the menu and provided solid recommendations.\", 'My partner and I snagged a last minute reservation for the last day of sf restaurant week at 6pm. When we arrived, the restaurant was mostly empty, but by the time we left an hour later, it was completely packed! We loved the ambience of the restaurant. It seems like there was a lot of thought put into all the details from the wall mural, to ceiling fixtures, to the utensil holders, to the various cups for each drink.Service was very friendly and attentive. The chef even stopped by to check in on our meal and talk about his thought process behind some of the dishes!Everything was very tasty, but the standouts were the braised oxtail and the tapioca dessert. We will definitely be back to try their a la carte menu!', 'Delicious food! I had been waiting to check this place out. Came with some friends on a Sunday, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. We ordered the garlic noodles with steak, duck egg rolls, and mussels in curry sauce with ramen noodles. All three dishes were super tasty. The beef in the garlic noodles was cooked perfectly, melting in your mouth. The duck egg rolls were very tender with the crispy outside perfectly complimenting the stuffing. The mussels were good too, but a bit difficult to eat as a shared dish. I also got a side of their hot sauce which comes in a little jar that I was able to take home. The restaurant has a really nice decor and ambience, and we sat at the chefs table where we could see them make the meal. Highly recommend this place!', \"It felt more like a sampling menu. $65pp for the set dinner but there isn't a whole lot of food. I understand when you come to a place like this, it's more about the trendy bar Asian fusion vibe. Everything was good from the beef carpaccio to the duck spring rolls to the fried catfish. I really enjoyed the pho spice cocktail!! And coffee cream brûlée was a delicious treat at the end. It does get really loud here due to the layout of the restaurant. You've also got the open kitchen right there to add to the mix. They're very popular so by 6:30, it's really crowded. If you come early, you shouldn't have a problem getting seated. Dishes take a little while to come out but service was quite friendly, as expected at places like this. I think I prefer more cozy places so there's a certain vibe you'd be looking for when you come to Lily's. I don't think I quite got my money's worth, hence 3 stars overall\", \"We came here on a Sunday night for dinner with no reservations but were able to get table seating. We ordered two appetizers and garlic noodles, but the appetizers were huge. For two people, we were both pretty content after the appetizers. We ordered:*beef carpaccio: also came with bone marrow and a large sesame cracker. This dish was so flavorful. *bo luc lac salad*garlic noodles with surf and turf: it was the same filet mignon as the bo luc lac salad. We took it to go as we couldn't finish it after the first two dishes.For drinks, we tried the strawberry daquiri and preserved lime blended margarita. The strawberry daquiri just tasted like a strawberry yogurt. The margarita was very salted plum forward. Will definitely be back to try other menu items.\", \"The first picture Yelp shows of Lily is its door. What a pretty door! It's a medium sized restaurant, and the seating is parallel to its bar/kitchen. The chef's dog, Bo, stands guard at the front of the restaurant and very relaxed and polite-- what a good boy.They take reservations via Resy, but they had plenty of empty tables when I dined on a Sunday lunch. The interior climate of the restaurant was damp as the ventilation was poor, with some moist and muggy pockets of air hitting you every so often. Service was decent, and the food came out pretty quickly.I tried the lunch set menu which includes a beverage, appetizer, and entree. What saddens me about Lily is that it aims to be elevated Vietnamese food, which comes with the glitz and the price tag, but the flavor? For every item that came to our table, we'd have the same descriptor: mild. It tasted like the essence of a dish rather than an actual dish. The only strong item was the Vietnamese Iced Coffee.\", \"We came in on a Sunday night without reservations, not knowing it was restaurant week, and had less than 15 min wait. The RW menu was $65, and was great selection and value for a special occasion For the first course, we tried the beef carpaccio, pho, and the duck rolls. The highlight of the three was the beef carpaccio, which had incredible balance of flavor in the light marinade/dressing, with an umami boost of fish sauce and much needed citrus to cut the fat from the bone marrow on the side. The sesame crackers offer great texture contrast. The other two dishes had great attention to flavor balance as well, just less extreme flavor rangeFor the second course, we tried the Hanoi bbq pork, turmeric fried catfish, and I believe an oxtail dish. The bbq pork and catfish dishes came with lots of Banh Hoi type materials, like lettuce, herbs, dipping sauces. They also came with rice paper, and I think our server recommended we just fold the food into them and dip before eating - I'm not sure that this is recommended, I think more typical may be to moisten the whole rice paper sheet before filling. People can eat it however they want, but offering some instruction either from staff or on the menu could be helpful here, since dealing with the rice paper isn't intuitive to all. I think moistening the rice paper entirely has a more pleasant texture. The Banh Hoi woven vermicelli noodles themselves are a marvel, cut to be just the right size for the rice paper, with a nice smoky garlic flavor, and satisfying springy texture. The catfish was spectacular, arrived sizzling and lightly crispy, and had a nice bed of fried onions to catch residual flavor.The banana pudding was excellent, with nice moist texture, and great temperature contrast with the ice cream. The tapioca pudding has a lot going on, but had a nice flavor balance.\", 'Loved santel our service provider who was warm and went above and beyond to make sure we understood the menu from start to finish. So for that we will def be coming back.The bone marrow was exceptional.  All the flavors harmonized and the herbs really made this dish sang.  Highly recommend. Bun rieu was very creative and had luscious flavors.  Though being Vietnamese I still felt it could use more tomato flavorPork chop was very high quality and was a generous portion. Something I always appreciate.  Will be back for many reasons but perhaps it was the service that made the experience memorable', \"Clement Street is so much fun with lots of varieties of cuisines to eat.  I highly recommend Lily, if you enjoy Vietnamese food with Californian flair, very friendly staff, and a warm comfortable setting.  I had the lunch special ($32pp) of fried fish and noodles, which had fresh dill.  The mango salad was spicy and refreshing.  Portions are large, beautifully presented, and seasoned perfectly.  There's a super friendly guy who works here and I'm sure people would return, not only for the great experience, but to see him again!\"]\n",

My wife thought I was exaggerating until I had to ring her ha', \"Came here on a Saturday night without a reservation. We waited for 40 minutes before we were seated. I'm normally not a huge fan of Italian but this is one of my favorite Italian spots in the bay.Not so - it was refreshing and the grapefruit really toned down the sweetness.Dungeness Crab Arancini - crispy on the outside. I loved how it was topped with pickled pepper radish and coated with scallion aioli. It was so good.Handkerchief - I'm always a fan of Bolognese so when I saw this white Bolognese, I knew I had to order it. It was so creamy but still felt light because the pasta was paper thin. I also loved how the pasta came out piping hot.Bucatini - the pistachio pesto got me to order this. The tomato based sauce was so light and tangy. The cheese on top added a little bit of creaminess. The pistachio pesto worked surprisingly well with the tomato sauce.\", \"Leaving a four star review because I think Yelpbiased higher scores but let's be clear this place was average, especially for food.Just being upfront the food was overpriced and over salted. It's not that it was bad per se, but not worth what Pearl is charging. Nothing was bad but nothing was memorable at all.If you're coming here, stick around for the service and pleasant atmosphere. Those were highlights.\", 'Want to have a great meal in a lovely place?  Try Pearl.   Being a single patron, I sat at the bar although I was given a choice to sit outside.  Both options seemed quite good.  And the staff was tip-top.Roasted cauliflower with sliced almonds, raisins and a black tahini hummus sauce was a great way to begin my meal.  The plate was well composed and the spicing was nuanced and subtle.Next up, seared scallops with spaetzle, corn and braised onions was a wonderful main course.  The crisp exterior of each large scallop encased an interior that was not overcooked.  And the sweet corn enlivened the entire plate.In and out and home to walk the dog while it was light.   And parking on Sunday evening was easy.', \"Pearl is my favorite restaurant in SF!I've tried a decent amount of their menu and everything is delicious! Starter, mains, dessert, drinks, everything!!! I try to stop by every few months to try their seasonal dishes.I had a work dinner here a few months back and my out of town colleagues all loved their meal here! Interior is very cute and service has always been great. They don't take reservations over 6 people so probably not the best for large groups, unless you're ok with splitting up the group into smaller tables.I love their cauliflower! I order it every time. For mains, all of their pastas are fantastic and I've loved every scallop seasonal dish I've had. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. My favorite cocktail is the tidy tips. Can't wait until my next visit!\", \"One of my favorite restaurants in the city! I love that it's hidden in the Richmond. I've come twice now and both times, the food was amazing and service was exceptional.I love trying their pastas, but everything is delicious. You can't go wrong with any of it.\", \"This is only my second time here, but it's become one of my favorite restaurants. I don't eat too much salad, but Pearl's Caesar is the exception. Their Caesar has a strong taste of anchovies, creating the perfect umami. If you're not a fan of anchovies, this salad may not sit will with you lol. It's lemony, cheesy, and the crispy prosciutto and croutons elevate the salad really well. I could eat this by myself if I tried, but of course I shared it with my boyfriend lol.Their steak tartare is the standard for me - whenever I order it elsewhere, it never compare to Pearl's. Beefy, lemony, and full of flavor. The texture pairs very well with the crisps they provide.The bavette steak was really good according to my boyfriend. He barely shared any with me and devoured it lol. I would love to order this next time if its on the menu.A few gripes..The Gemelli - first bite was delicious, full of flavor. I loved the spice and combination of the capers and sun dried tomatoes. The tuna was cooked well. The thing is - the more I ate, I soon came to realize how salty the dish was. I love salt and all things savory, but it became difficult to eat. I love olives, but their olives made the pasta even saltier considering the capers and spice. They really need to lighten their hand when seasoning this dish lol. I would have returned the dish had I not waited so long for it. This brings me to my next point..The wait - It was busy. I will not deny that. We were lucky enough to snag a reservation. Our Rez was at 730, and we came right on time and was seated immediately. We ordered maybe within the next 5 minutes. Our apps came out pretty fast, and I'd say we were done eating them by 810? The thing is, our entrees didn't come out until 840. Every single table around us had gotten their food before us, despite having came after us. The table to our left only ordered entrees - ok, that I understand. But the table seated directly behind us came a good 20 minutes after us, and also ordered apps, yet their entrees were also delivered before ours. The table to our right had completely finished eating before we even got our entrees. It was disappointing, as the service was subpar. I understand it's busy, but the waitress (Katie I believe) didn't pay us any mind and we had to flag her down to receive updates regarding our order. I'm willing to wait, so long as it doesn't feel like our order was forgotten lol. It felt like that. The waitress didn't seemed concerned that we were waiting that long. I honestly think she forgot to put our entrees in? Either that, or they need to work on their timing with the delivery of apps and entrees. I will surely be returning and will be supporting this business, but would recommended avoiding the dinner rush as much as possible. I'm sure it's much better when they open right at 5. Overall, this restaurant deserves their flowers despite the underwhelming service.\", 'It was soooo good! Food is amazing! Definitely must visit place for amazing experience.', \"Ambiance: I booked an inside table for 8pm on a Sunday. It was charming and lively. Very nice for a date night. Service: Attentive and nice!Oysters: 4/5Solid - texture was smooth and the toppings complimented the oyster. Acme bread and butter: 4/5Solid, but nothing special - what I'd expect from complimentary bread and butter from the table, except this time it was a $4 chargeChicory Caesar: 5/5Amazing! I love the texture and taste of the crispy prosciutto with crisp mixed lettuce. The croutons were also great. Everything worked well together. Handkerchief: 4/5Solid pasta, and best pasta of the night. I haven't had a white bolognese before. It was light and easy to eat. If I were to make this at home, I would add maybe a touch of truffle oil to add more to the dish. Bucatini: 4/5Loved the stracciatellla with the pesto and basil. I thought the dish was okay at first, but it grew on me with each bite that I took. Buttermilk Panna Cotta: 5/5Silky panna cotta, absolutely lovely with the strawberries and the chocolate sable. Olive Oil Cake: 5/5This was my favorite out of the two desserts I tried. The texture of the cake was everything and more. The ice cream worked well with the cake too. If you were to choose between the cake and the panna cotta, choose the cake!Overall, solid food. I wouldn't go back for the pasta, but definitely for the desserts and caesar salad!\", \"Food:The cauliflower was what I ordered and it was surprisingly delicious. The raisins balanced out the savory aspects and really made the dish stand out. Service:Perfect, we saw that everyone was very warm and friendly and attentive.Ambiance: It's lively but also romantic.

Recommended to try with open mind Staff not real attentive', \"Hubby and I recently got the chance to try out Fog Harbor Fish House! It's been on our list of spots to check out in SF for awhile. Luckily, his sister has been here several times and spoke very highly of this restaurant.RESERVATIONS: Recommended! Fog Harbor is top rated on Yelp when you search SF. It's in a prime location therefore we highly suggest making reservations.AMBIANCE: Casual with amazing views of the bay. The restaurant has big glass windows around its entirety overlooking the bay. Even on their patio, they have dividers that give you privacy but you also get beautiful views of the bay and the bridge. MENU/FOOD: They have a large selection of foods as well as a seasonal menu. The average prices were $20-$50 per plate. We each opted for their clam chowder and also for their lobster ravioli, clam linguine with alfredo sauce, and mixed grill. All of these items came in fairly large portions, large enough to share. The clam chowder here is very delicious. Very creamy and loaded with so much clam. They gave complimentary sourdough rolls which complemented the chowder. The clam linguine is also creamy and the linguine is cooked to a perfect al dente. The lobster ravioli was superb. The ravioli skin was soft and held flavorful bites of lobster with ricotta. The lobster tasted so fresh! As for the mixed grill, it was our favorite! We substituted the shrimp for more salmon. The salmon was very tender and the seasoning on the salmon was out of this world. We couldn't get enough of it! The mashed potatoes were very creamy and the grilled vegetables were very refreshing with a hint of lemon. OVERALL EXPERIENCE: Easily one of our top favorite restaurants at SF officially. We understand the high ratings behind Fog Harbor now. The food is outstanding and the service was great. They were very accommodating towards us by opening their patio for us to enjoy a meal with our pug. Even though we were the only party outside, our waitress made sure we were well taken care of. We couldn't stop talking about the amazing food and experience here at Fog Harbor. We will always stop by here anytime we visit SF moving forward!\", \"I was finally able to come back to this fantastic restaurant and this time, I brought nine family members with me. I spent the day talking this place up and hoped they wouldn't make a liar out of me.I'm happy to report that they lived up to the hype once again. Everybody at the table, including my mom who's a bit picky, loved Fog Harbor.I went with a cup of the clam chowder (never come here without ordering at least the cup) as a starter and the filet mignon with potato mash and wilted spinach as my entree.I've been to many steak houses and can honestly say the filet mignon I had here was among the best I've had. It was cooked to perfection and while I don't feel it needed it, the delicious demi glaze took it up a notch.We're currently planning a trip to the city this spring with our closest friends for their anniversary and I've already decided to treat them to dinner here. Seriously, I can't say enough. Great experience every time.\", 'We\\'re giving FOG HARBOR the TOP Five 5 Star rating based on a few factors.First off, it has to fight the stigma of residing in Pier 39, known by locals in SF as a \"tourist trap\" type location.  It\\'s actually high quality as an experience and the food portions, taste and prices are fair.  We were expecting to be gauged and get sub-part quality being at Pier 39.If this relocated to any other area in SF, it would probably be at the top of many local\\'s lists, especially if parking was easy and traffic wasn\\'t gridlocked to get to.So, if you\\'re a tourist and see this place and worry about it being questionable with so many other choices, the right decision is to look at the menu first and if you see stuff you like, go here and don\\'t roll the dice on other places which may not give you a solid experience as Fog Harbor does and has/had for us.We\\'re locals in SF but came with visiting tourists, and everyone was happy.We had the Clam Chowder and one comment on the table was it wasn\\'t \"Salty\" (a negative would be being salty) and that it was served \"Hot\" (and that\\'s a good trait to be piping hot and allowed to cool down rather than come warm and end up being cold.We had the Halibut, Sole and Swordfish without any complaints and completely empty plates after indulging in the entrees.Yeah, they charge the dreaded \"5% SF Employee Mandate \"Tax\" Surcharge\" which I think all San Francisco restaurants do, on top of the 8.625% sales tax then whatever you end up tipping... so you are leaving paying 30%+ more than the menu list price on everything.  That\\'s more of a comment on the state of San Francisco\\'s policies than anything this restaurant can control or is at any blame for.The service was friendly, fast and accommodating.  They asked about food allergies and tastes/dislikes ahead of ordering, being very conscientious of their customers needs.They give complimentary rolls and butter which is always a huge plus never to be taken for granted.On a weekend night, you can find street parking for under $1 an hour as opposed to parking in the Pier 39 parking structure or paid parking lots.I\\'d recommend this spot to all.', \"This restaurant is so beautiful as you get to sit right by the pier. The waiters are so friendly and will provide great service. This place is such a great date spot or a nice place to eat. The seafood here is so fresh. Seared Pacific Cod - 4/5- the garbanzo beans overpowered the cod itself however if you ate the cod on its own with the aioli it tastes amazing. the fish was so fresh which made this dish more rich and flavorful. I'd highly recommended this if you are craving cod. Shrimp Brochette - 5/5- the shrimp was beautifully cooked. the butter had such a rich smell and when you put it on the shrimp it tasted amazing. the mashed potatoes were a bit bland but the green beans were cooked so well. Crab Ravioli- 4/5- the ravioli itself was very cheesy and the crab pieces on top tasted amazing. the whole dish was amazing overall but it was a bit too greasy for me. you also only get 4 large pieces of ravioli Calamari- 5/5- you could tell the calamari is fresh and not stored in the frozen fridge for over a month. it had a nice texture and it was perfectly fried.Overall i would come back here because the food is amazing and the ambience is so nice.\"]\n",

The mezzanine is so cute and intimate.The espresso martinis were the best we've had in the city and the desserts were so flavorful. We had the brown butter brownie and the spiced apple cider cake.We can't wait to come back for dinner!\", 'This place had excellent service, amazing plates and lively ambiance. Came here for a birthday and definitely recommend getting a reservation on open table! The pork chop was the best thing we ate! The burger is good and very flavorful but the pork chop was excellent. We got a few appetizers that included the season salad and the fresh calamari. Both were excellent!', 'Had an AMAZING dinner here with friends the other night! We were seated on the balcony, very comfortable, great ambiance. Loved the emphasis on fresh quality and rotating menu, which was excellent. We ordered several appetizers (loved the pork shoulder) and chose the duck breast, vegetable tagine, and pappardelle as our main. The duck breast was exquisite, tender, and wonderfully flavored (also quite a large portion size!). The pasta was also a stand-out for me, perfectly cooked. Loved the cocktails as well - eager to come back again for drinks. Highly recommend, definitely shot towards the top of my list of SF restaurants!', \"Nopa's ambience strikes a perfect balance between trendy and inviting.

The space if nice and the bar is a great place to eat and drink.  Although the bartender that serviced us had a flat personality we did see other staff who interacted well with customers and were friendly.  I would return but definitely would not recommend or try the burger again. Burger - 2.5/5 - I am admittedly not into thick patties on a burger, so Nopa's burger was an immediate turn off.  Still, I can appreciate a good burger but Nopa's just did not do it for me; at all.  Aside from being two inches thick the patty seriously lacked flavor.  Oh, and we asked for medium rare but got medium/medium well.  The meat dry and the bread did not hold together well.  Huge disappointment for, especially at a cost of $28. Fried Chicken - 3.5/5 - Tasty spices coated the skin exterior and the quarter bird was a great value.  However, the coating was fried to the point of being hard and the interior was not moist.  Maybe Nopa does not brine the chicken or maybe it was left in the fryer too long, either way the meat was dry and the fried chicken was okay at best.Roasted Cauliflower - 4/5 - I liked the texture and seasoning.  The beet purée was a perfect accompaniment.\", \"My sister and I travelled to SF for a siblings trip and my other sister suggested this restaurant. She has lived here for about 5 years and this is one of her favorite restaurants. I went here a few days ago and this is my favorite restaurant in SF. It is more expensive, but I understand why. Let me start out saying that this was the best broccoli and burger I've ever eaten. I was reaching for seconds and thirds of the broccoli. No broccoli or burger will ever compare to what I have tried here. The fried chicken was good and the crunchiest I've ever had. The pappardelle bolognese was tasty and filling. Really, you can't choose wrong here. Our server was very attentive and explained the menu well. There was never a time we needed something and didn't receive it. The food arrived about 45 min for the food was ordered. I will be back the next time I visit my sister. I cannot stop telling my local friends back home about the broccoli and burger.\", 'It is a sleek and cool restaurant with an upscale vibe! the cuisine was well made and delicious! The only negative was the Brussel Sprouts we found too salty.', \"We really enjoyed this restaurant. The cocktails were the best part. They're a little expensive, but they are so cute, colorful, bright and delicious that it's so worth it! The food was excellent too. We got the duck breast and the pork chop, and those were both really tasty. It was busy and lively. Service was good too. You may need reservations, especially on a weekend.\", \"A fun spot! The ambiance was excellent! I really loved the latke appetizer. The fried chicken entree was good for what it was. I'd love to come here to sit at the bar.\", 'Excellent food and excellent service at San Francisco prices.Firstly, make sure to make a reservation for this one as they are consistently booked up. I love places that are heavy on the shared plates so I can try a whole bunch and also love rotating menus. Every bite was delicious from the eggplant parmesan to the squash and corn flatbread to the peaches and stracciatella. Waitress had great recommendations. They used to have brunch which I heard was delicious and wish they would bring that back! As expected, it is not cheap but it is not outrageously price withers. Shared plates are around $20 and mains are $30-45 and I would recommend 3 shared places or one main and one shared for 2']\n",

      "   Reviews: ['The best restaurant in San Francisco. Cook knows his job   and he is so talented. Everything is amazing. Foods are amazing that took me to İstanbul.', \"Bistro Ember is one of our new favorite neighborhood spots. Every single dish totally blew us away and you can tell the chef put a lot of thought into the detail and presentation of each plate. We started with amazing fried chickpea bread served w/butter stunningly shaped as a honeycomb. The Manti Dumplings were filled with a savory lamb and beef mixture and served in a rich, oak-smoked yogurt sauce, and the Turkish Tagliatelle was tossed w/tender grilled chicken and a nutty, fragrant antep pistachio pesto. The 12-hr Slow Cooked Lamb Shank was filled w/flavor and just melted off the bone. For dessert, our Turkish Coffee Cake was moist and chocolatey w/a coffee sauce poured over, and the Burnt Chicken Pudding was a delightful surprise - a rich & creamy pudding w/goat cheese ice cream, cinnamon crumble and topped with a candied piece of crispy chicken skin. The ambiance was so elegant and cozy w/warm, exposed brick walls. I definitely recommend this place looking for a nice dinner and can't wait to come back to try their weekend brunch.\", \"Absolutely delicious, elegant, and friendly here. There are so many great things to try on the brunch and dinner menus.Try the Traditional Turkish Breakfast!  The staff are extremely friendly and very good at walking you through the different items on the menu.The decor is lovely as well.   You feel like you are in an exclusive lounge. Can't wait to come back!\", \"My husband and I honeymooned in Turkey so we were SO excited to see Ember open near us, and decided to try it for our 15th anniversary dinner. In our reservation, we asked to be seated in a quieter area away from large parties. Unfortunately, when we arrived - it was midweek - we found the restaurant to be ear-splittingly loud. And we were offered a table by a party of 18 :-(  To their credit, the staff tried to accommodate us by offering a table farther away from the large party (if we were willing to wait 15 or 20 minutes) but it wasn't going to be much quieter there. We walked away sadly, and were lucky to find a table at a quieter restaurant in the neighborhood.  I wish the designers of Ember gave more thought to acoustics (I didn't see any of those sound panels on the ceiling for instance). Or maybe they want to discourage diners over 40?  The menu looks so interesting and the space is beautiful, so we hope to try it another time, as long as we don't have to shout to be heard.\", 'As you enter this establishment...in one of the quaintest neighborhoods in SF...a warm glowing fireplace greets you.  The restaurant style is cozy and stylish with great aesthetics.  The staff was superb with attentiveness.  The menu is small in choices but packed with delicious choices, flavors and tastes.  We enjoyed all our dishes...the bread was so yummy, the salads flavor-filled with freshness and brightness.  The entrees...the tagliatelle with grilled chicken, the fillet and the lamb shank...winning.  We tried two desserts...the chocolate cake with Turkish coffee a definite table pleaser.  We all are still raving over our meals.  Bravo!!!', \"Wow! What a gem in the Mission District that provides an upscale exploration into Turkish cuisine. I am guilty of not trying many Turkish dishes in the past, but after a night at Bistro Ember I am now sold. Aside from the rock star dishes, which I'll go more into detail in a bit, the service is stellar. As cliche as this may sound, you can feel the blood, sweat and tears put into the restaurant. Each worker has a huge smile and describes each dish with pride and passion. Most notably for our dessert course, the pastry chef came out to present the dish and had so much happiness as he was describing how to eat it. The staff definitely deserves five stars for providing such high level service. Now, to the part you are all here for: THE FOOD! Our personal favorites were the Turkish Tartare, Chickpea Yeast Bread, Lamb Mutancana and Chicken Pudding. Wow was that tartare packed with flavor. It was a mix of Kofte (Turkish meatball) and tenderloin. Man, I am not sure what spice was in the dish but it was so tasty. I could eat an entire plate on my own. Regarding the bread...it was so good! Fluffy, warm and paired exceptionally with the butter. It had great bounce and you couldn't even notice it was made out of chick peas. Now to the lamb...so tender paired with a smooth and luscious keskek (a Turkish risotto)! The sauce was silky and we licked every last bit of it up. Finally, the pudding. This was a perfect ending to our dinner! It had such a nutty flavor, and you couldn't even tell there was chicken in the dish at all. The goat cheese ice cream had an amazing tang that cut the savoriness of the pudding. Overall, amazing service and tasty dishes! You need to try this place out if you're in the mood for a Turkish meal.\", \"Every morsel and bite we had was delicious! We started with a cold appetizer: Fish and Raki. Raki is the national drink of Turkey and it's twice distilled grapes. It was light and perfect for summer.Then came the piping HOT yeast bread and our hot appetizer - the couscous. The couscous was my favorite dish because of the spring onion and basil purées that are incorporated into the dish.For a entrée, we had the Lamb Mutancana, which was tender, moist and flavorful. It is perhaps the most traditional Turkish dish on the menu but it was nice to have a traditional component to an otherwise very contemporary and innovative menu.Wait, we also had coffee and dessert! We couldn't resist trying the Burnt Chicken skin pudding. It was very unique and equally delicious.The service and the wait staff were perfect. There was ample parking outside on a Saturday night. The place is brand new and well turned out. It was quiet so we could hear each other talk, but it wasn't too quiet. We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and would go back again in a heartbeat.\", \"This review is for brunch only.  I had to make a last minute reservation change to increase our large party size, so I called and the restaurant was so accommodating!  They even were nice enough to let us push the time a bit.  This place has a good ambiance.  The omelets were huge.  I ordered a Turkish coffee to try it... but didn't realize it comes the size of an espresso, albeit in an elegant tea cup set, lol.  Got to savor my three sips with pinkie up of course.  Though brief, the bold dark roast was quite enjoyable.  I would love to come back and try the dinner menu which looks much more interesting!\", 'My fiancé and I were able to snag a reservation to try out Bistro Ember during their first week of opening. The waiters and staff were very professional and attentive.  Understandably since it was their opening week, the wait was a bit longer than expected. Dishes we had:EMBER OYSTER - I got 6 of their oysters which were very fresh and light. Love the sauce that accompany them.TURKISH TARTARE - fun rendition of steak tartare with a Turkish flare. I thought it was good. Personally, when the kofte and tartare were  all mixed together, that usual tartare texture got lost a little. EMBER OCTOPUS - the octopus was nicely seasoned and perfectly cooked. The sauce it came with brought it together.COUSCOUS - delicious dish! It ended up being my entrée and I really enjoyed it. The calamari dolmas were very tasty and they went well with the basil purée. LAMB MUTACANA - the cooked lamb shoulder was good and it paired well with the mushrooms and keske (resembles a little to mashed potatoes). However, not a fan of the anise and plum purées. They felt too sweet and overpowering. For dessert, we shared the TURKISH COFFEE CAKE. Solid dessert and the star of this dish was actually the berries sorbet. Overall, our meal was very tasty and the plating of each dish we had was beautiful and seems intentional. They also have a decent wine selection to choose from.The restaurant is cozy and the decor is beautiful. I would recommend everyone to check them out!Congratulations on opening in Noe ! Wishing the team at Bistro Ember all the best!', 'Fabulous and cozy, Ember is a number one date night or special occasion eatery. Don\\'t let the \"Bistro\" fool you.

I GOT IT ... and we watched the Happy one walk away still smiling! He later came and asked if I wanted anything else and I asked for more wine and could not help but squeeze in there how I loved how he treated his guests and his smile! Didn't get his name but I do remember his face and will definitely ask to sit in his area!  That was that! We loved the ambiance and if all the servers were like the tall guy, well you'll be seeing us more!Now the food ... absolutely delicious!

The ambiance is great, it was pretty packed on a Thursday night and in a great location in Castro. The service was a little slow (probably bc they were busy) and forgot our drinks until after the food came. The food was ok, I was excited for the Wagyu burger ($27) but it was a lot smaller than I expected, and the meat was SO dry I couldn't even finish it. I wish they put other toppings inside it like lettuce, pickles, or anything to give some juiciness. The fries that came with it were delicious though! My partner got a chicken dish that was tastier and more worth the price. The mashed potatoes it came with were really great! If I come back here, I would definitely try the Mac and cheese after all the positive reviews about it!\", \"While we were eating at Blind Butcher, a guy casually walks by nekkid...full frontal and everything...and hardly anyone bats an eye.Except the tourist couple whose jaws were sweeping the floor.That's what I love about The Castro...if you got the balls to, anything goes!Been eyeing The Blind Butcher since they opened in 2019 (sister resto to Dunya and Lark).

We loved it all. The rib eye was cooked perfectly medium and came with little potatoes and peppers on the side. The pork chop was moist and had lots of carrots and potatoes in the sauce. The calamari was thick and tasted really well with the sauce. The potatoes were a great side and perfectly cooked. We did family style and between the 3 of us, there were still some leftovers.

Generous portions of lobster in the dish, with a perfect crisp cheese layer up top and gooey bits inside. The mac and cheese was served in a cast iron pan which kept it warm throughout our meal. Macaroni was al dente, and the bite on the pasta mixed so well with the mushy cheese! Service was excellent and they accommodated my vegetarian dietary preferences by serving me a Moussaka from their neighbor restaurant \"Lark\". It was mildly spiced and had lots of fresh veggies. Finally, the merlot that was served with the main course was rich with some fruity notes. Great for sipping though a conversation. Must visit the Blind Butcher!', 'I was really impressed with the branzino and the Elderberry cocktail, but less so with the practically raw shishito peppers. The service was scatterbrained and we were often left waiting long periods of time to place orders. Our two hour meal could have expediently been half that with more attentive service. The dining area was nevertheless nicely decorated and dark enough and loud enough to impart some privacy, though not so much of either to be miserable. Overall, standard overpriced meal in San Francisco.']\n",

We had kumamotos, miyagis, and mere point oysters for our raw oysters, I believe. For the baked oysters, we tried the garlic butter (YUM), and the miso bone marrow (my personal fave!).  The spritz cocktails are really good too.  We tried the pink spritz and the lavender yuzu spritz (super refreshing).

My friend and I came for lunch with a reservation but it wasn't too crowded. We got six Oysters, the Halibut Crudo, Smoked Salmon Tartine, and the Roasted Nori Cauliflower. The oysters were incredibly refreshing, and we love that we got to sample all three. I also loved the small plates we ordered. The cauliflower was so umami and had a nice bite to it, while the tartine was so hearty and creamy. Service was decent. Nothing to write home about but the atmosphere does make it worth the visit, as it's bright but homey.\", \"All the rave reviews are true - this place is a keeper! Perfect location and immaculate vibes, we loved everything about little shucker. We walked in at opening on a Saturday without a reservation and were seated immediately. The waitstaff was completely attentive and took our drink orders right away. One of our guests ordered a wine on tap, and within minutes was informed that they had to switch out the keg. She had to wait about ten minutes for her glass, and when it was brought to her, we were told it was on the house for her patience. She was offered alternatives but really wanted that wine, so despite her choosing to wait they still comped the glass - completely unnecessary but entirely grateful, we were won over immediately. Then the oysters came. In a city brimming with seafood options, this was the freshest of the fresh. We inhaled our dozen (with a variety from Tomales Bag and the east coast) just in time for the mussels to hit the table. When I tell you we were lapping up the garlic marinade, we were fighting over the last spoonful. For a seafood focused restaurant, their fries were also memorable, and the house hot sauce is  chef's kiss. Incredible experience all the way around - can't wait to come back to little shucker!\", \"The cutest spot on Fillmore! Perfect for a sunny day in SF.

This buzzy Pac Heights seafood spot from the team behind The Snug excels when it comes to simple, good seafood. I sampled a majority of the menu, and my favorite item was the Big Shucker, a classic chilled seafood tower that allows the quality to shine. If you love oyster shooters, you have to try their two creative takes - a sake tomato dashi with uni and a play on michelada with kimchi and pilsner. In addition to the tasty raw oyster selection, I also enjoyed the warm bone marrow baked oyster.For more substantial bites, I recommend the smoked salmon tartine with bright dill cream cheese on a fluffy pan de mie. The hot lobster roll was fine, but not as memorable. I would skip adding caviar to the roll, as it got lost with the strong flavors.My friend and I were comfortably full from the seafood feast, but we couldn't resist trying the pretty greek yogurt tart with seasonal stone fruit - a sweet, but restrained ending to a solid meal.I like that the smaller space, friendly staff, and menu lends itself to many occasions, whether it's a casual lunch, early happy hour, or romantic dinner date.\", 'Came here for dinner on a weekend.Food: 4Decor: 4Service: 46 oysters, 22miyagi, kumamoto, and mere point~4/5.

Pretty good, although I think New England Lobster Co. in Burlingame is slightly better.Service was nice and friendly.', \"Ambiance- decor was really nice and clean, bathrooms were well maintained and the table tops were tidyService- a little awkward and choppy but nice people, but incredibly slow for certain food items Food- some things were delicious and other things needed more attention*Big shucker- presentation was pretty, I think that the oysters were shucked fine, a little shelly but no real complaints. We sat at the bar so we watched them prepare the tower in front of us. The shrimp was really dry and didn't taste fresh at all, however the mussels were our favorite part! The Maine lobster was fine,nothing extraordinary and the geoduck was also okay. *lobster roll- I can't believe they charge 2$ for the chips when the roll is already 35$ I think that's absurd. It was also a small portion and lacked a sauce (butter isn't a sauce) **smoked trout salad- it reminded me of a deconstructed lox bagel in a good way. I wish the portion size was larger or if the plate had more lettuce ** we received our big shucker first at 2:15 and quickly finished the tower in about 10-15 mins because there wasn't a whole lot to it and we were super hungry. But we weren't served our salad and roll until 2:45 which we thought was a super long time to wait between plates. Especially because it wasn't particularly busy and the components of our plates were already made eg: the lobster was precooked and the trout was smoked so assembling the items on a plate shouldn't have taken too long (time stamps attached).  Price- not good, I hadn't realized or noticed that there was a 20% automatic service charge which I think is quite high (for this particular place). We were a group of four but they were kind and they split the bill into two for us because they noticed each couple shared items. I think 17-18% service charge is more realistic. Especially because we had really slow service between our plates.\", \"I have been craving baked oysters lately and it's actually quite hard to find.   Little Shucker appeared on my search and they had a reservation opened so we gave them a try. The ambience is so cute, it's so bright and welcoming, it reminds me being inside sometimes home in some coastal town.  They tend to get busy around 6pm, so I recommend making reservations. They have a happy hour menu too, and if you want that deal you have to come before 5 pm.  For Happy Hour they have raw oysters for 12 or 24 dollars depending if you get half a dozen or a dozen.  And of course, with happy hour there's wine or beer.  For our starters we did get the dozen oysters for $24.00 along with the crudo.  The fresh oysters were good and plump.  They gave you three sauces to pair with, the green sauce was the best. The crudo was paired with their avocado mousse and tomatoes which was so tasty!  I wish they gave us more of that mousse.   We also go the baked oysters which included the rockefeller, garlic butter, and miso bone marrow.  All of these were good, but i think my favorite was the Garlic Butter, followed by the Miso Bone Marrow and then the Rockefeller.   The miso bone marrow said it had cilantro but i couldn't taste it, which was good because i'm not a cilantro fan. The Lobster roll was delicious as you can taste how buttery the bread as and how sweet and juicy the lobster was.  It does get very messy to eat but it's worth the messiness. I hope they can expand their menu soon like their sister restaurant The Snug. I would love to come back and we can tell their staff is a great team as i see them working so well together.\"]\n",

I can't wait to come back and try more dishes. The salmon curry was unique and delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly.\", \"This place is such a hidden gem!  I've been here few times and was satisfied every time i went.  The place itself is simple and casual with a touch of elegance.  It was very cozy and perfect for friends gathering or even a date night.  Service was welcoming from start to finish.  They know their menu pretty well and gave good recommendations.  Food was outstanding with its unique flavors.  I felt it is a combination of Korean Thai fusion.Here's what we ordered, and the portions are pretty bigKimchi rice balls (4/5)Recommend* A perfect appetizer to share.  Crispy outside with kimchi flavored rice inside and topped a special sauce that made everything work.Tom Yum Noodle Soup (5/5)A bit spicy but the soup itself was very rich.  Highlight of the soup is actually the crispy pork inside.  Very delicious overall.Korean Spicy Noodle (5/5)If you like Korean style cold noodle, this is the dish you can't go wrong with. It was sweat and sour with a little bit spice.  Very refreshing. Bibimbap (3/5)This dish was ok, a bit blend. I would recommend making a reservation just in case.\", \"Glad I got to try this place but I won't be back. I made reservations for 6:30 and got here a few minutes early. Parking was not the greatest but that was expected. We parked 3 blocks away.The restaurant was pretty empty upon arrival and stayed that way until the end of the meal. Together we ordered:Hamachi Kama 3/5: standard. I really liked the sauce that it came with. Thai braised chicken: 2/5 nothing special. Had a side of wonton noodles in a sauce that I didn't not enjoy. Cold spicy noodles with pork jowl: 2/5 flavors were great a few bites in but I was really struggling to finish it.\", \"Kothai, the Korean and Thai fusion gem, not only impressed with its unique and delicious dishes but also stands out for providing one of the best service experiences I've encountered. The waiter went above and beyond by keeping us updated on wait times, setting the tone for a positive dining experience.The menu at Kothai showcases creativity with unique and flavorful dishes. The creative appetizers add an exciting dimension to the meal, and personally, the noodle dishes became a clear favorite.Adding to the overall appeal, the environment at Kothai is super aesthetic, making it an excellent choice for a great date spot. The thoughtful combination of delightful dishes, exceptional service, and a visually appealing setting makes Kothai a standout fusion restaurant.In summary, Kothai is a must-visit for those seeking a fusion of Korean and Thai flavors. With top-notch service, creative dishes, and a charming environment, it creates an ideal setting for a memorable dining experience.\", \"New, Korean Thai fusion restaurant that lives up to its name. Wasn't too busy and the restaurant was kind of quiet on a Sunday 2pm lunch time. Service was quick to seat and refill water.5/5 Crispy Grilled Hamachi Collar was super fresh and came with a crunchy green chili basil crumb underneath that pairs well with the white, less seasoned parts of the fish. The dish would've been perfect with a scoop of white rice to soak up the crispy , not too oily bits of fish skin. 4/5 Thai Braised Chicken was solid, the meat was juicy and tender to fork off the bone. I liked how it came with mushroom but was surprised the sauce to pour over it wasn't salty or as umami.Luckily, I asked for their condiment rack and the green chili vingarette sauce was the perfect combo with the chicken. The spice one was alright, both were freshly made in house.Would come back with a larger group to try different items!\", \"Delicious, spicy flavors exploding in your mouth! The Tom yum noodle wasn't too spicy but still had a Thai kick and lemongrass flavor. I'd definitely order the Tom yum again and the mushroom, bean sprout, egg, and not over cooked king shrimps (2) were delish. We mostly tried the Thai side of the menu,but it is a Thai Korean fusion place. The mushroom plate had a unique flavor dip and crunch with the leaves which had an acid taste too. The chocolate mousse was rich but not heavy. The berry compote was a nice addition to it too. We also enjoyed the crudo with smoked flavor and squid texture plus mango sauce with a kick. Also amazing. The vibe: clean, modern look on the corner of Judah and 9th. Clear glass windows and inside heaters with pretty wreaths. Hope it stays here for a while and will be in our rotation of places to come again to. We walked in at 7pm on a Saturday night and there was no wait. There was a table or two open !\", \"20/10! So thankful I stumbled across this TikTok video to try Kothai. I was a bit skeptical to try since Bangsang (another Korean fusion restaurant) was super disappointing but I cannot say enough great things about this place! Besides the food being absolutely amazing, the service was what stood out the most. Every single person in there was so sweet, attentive, and food came out pretty quick!We had the Hamachi Kama, Kalbi, Iron steak, Ceviche, and both noodle soups. The ceviche, Kalbi, and Tom yum noodle soup is a MUST TRY! I'd love to come back\", \"Sep 2023Solid. New place to try at the end of the trip. The decor is nice and simple, and the curtains were lowered so the sun didn't beat down on us. The service was friendly, and helpful with any questions we had. Check ins and water refills were frequent.We had gotten the kimchi rice balls to split. Compatriots ordered the Tom Yum and the Beef noodle soup. I got the bibimbap vegan with egg. The flavor fusions worked well flavorwise. The broths for both soups were rich and the balance of ingredients worked well. The Kimchi rice balls were a good opener with the sauce bringing a nice richness to it. I didn't lick the plate but I was close. The bibimbap was plated very well and presentation was really nice. The sauce brought things together tho it was a bit fresh for me. I'd want a bit of salt even without the sauce, and something savory to tie it.All in all definitely a good stop. I'd be interested to try other things on the menu next time.\", \"I came here with a group of friends before Outside Lands, as we wanted to get some food at a Thai place that was not too far from it. While the inside isn't the largest, we were able to get a table to seat the party of 10 or so that we had. The service was good and while our food did take some time, I think that's mainly due to the larger size of our party. I ordered the Tomyum noodle soup and the kimchi rice balls. The portion size for the noodle soup is substantial, and I think for the price it's pretty worth. The flavors were good for the tomyum and the meat inside it were also cooked well. The Kimchi rice balls were pretty interesting, as the outside was quite crispy with the kimchi stuffed within. I think this is worth getting as an appetizer, and it's a good one to share with a couple others! Overall, it's a nice restaurant and would recommend trying it out!\", 'No Fees']\n",

      "   Reviews: [\"This is a Japanese Yakitori Restaurant named Yakitori Edomasa. It has good reviews on Yelp but can I really trust it?Upon entering, I saw the original cart where they sold the first yakitori skewers 100 years ago and it's in perfect condition. On the walls, there are hand signatures of famous sumo wrestlers that would come to the restaurant after a match or practice. Overall, the ambiance is very warm and comforting so that's a star.Next I had to see if the meat really does come from Tokyo. I asked the chefs and they said not only does the meat come from Tokyo but so do they and that I am in good hands. All the chefs greeted me as I walked in and it really felt like an authentic experience. My mouth was watering as I walked by and saw them grill the Yakitori so that's a starNext, I needed to see how the service was and it did not disappoint. My server was extremely nice and read out to me the entire menu, gave me his recommendations, and even brought me some sweet sake so that's a starThe server brought me a sweet pear sake and he overflowed it and told me to take 1 sip and then pour the rest into the cedar cup. I did just that and my soul left my body, literally cause I got so red after so that's a star.I ordered the $30 Yakitori set and it came with 7 different courses. The chicken soup, patty, and skewers definitely lived up to the hype. Absolutely delicious. 5 stars.\", \"First: the good. Decor was super kitschy and fun. Facade really succeeded at pulling me in & making me think this was a street foot vendor in Japan. Loved this.The praise ends at here unfortunately. The food in its current form is just not authentic or good. The cuts of meat are too big for the skewers, and they are packed too closely together. This, combined with the uneven cooking, led to the majority of our skewers being crispy on one end, mushy on the other.The tastes were confusing too. Lots of sauces slathered on, very difficult to taste the chicken underneath. This might work if they're trying to do some sort of fusion thing, but with the decor, I'm guessing they're hoping this comes across as traditional. I can't give this a passing grade in that respect, unfortunately. The final insult: no chicken skin. Come on, people! That's literally the best part. You can't not do chicken skin at a place like this.I gave the chefs a ごちそうさま on the way out the door, but none of them seemed to understand me. Please, get someone in the kitchen who has actually lived there & knows what this food should taste like.\", \"Yay for a new restaurant in Japantown center!! This place specializes only in chicken skewers and apparently comes all the way from Tokyo! We got the $30 tasting menu which comes with 7 apps/skewers. I'm not a huge meat person so not sure how to discern quality but everything tasted pretty good to me. Some skewers felt a bit dry but that's chicken for you.I was surprisingly pretty full at the end, perhaps because they help pace the skewers as well.Service was great and it wasn't hard to walk in early Friday night\", \"After hearing about how popular this yakitori spot was in Tokyo, I was excited to try it in SF. Its new location is inside the shops of Japantown on the second floor in the corner. They're currently only offering a set menu that involves various parts of chicken. There's a decent amount of seating inside and they were readily able to accommodate our party of 7. My favorite items from the set were the momo (thigh) and the nakamoto (mid joint wing). These pieces of the chicken were moist and coated with enough sauce. Other skewers such as the breast were standard. The last item from the set was seasoned rice, but it didn't have chicken in it and was quite heavy to finish off on. I wish they would've ended on the chicken paitan soup instead of starting with it. The soup was a hearty, home-y chicken soup. We also got pitchers of sapporo which is a must when eating yakitori. I'll definitely be back to try other menu items once they roll out a different menu!\", \"I caught a newspaper article about this spot opening up and made plans for dinner with a friend who was in town visiting. We arrived around 7pm and put our name on the waitlist. Pro-tip: I didn't realize they use Yelp's waitlist feature and so do check the waitlist before you head over and put your name in ahead of time if the wait is long. We were quoted about an hour wait and got seated around 8:30pm, which was fine for us since we'd already committed, but we were already behind about 20 parties when we first arrived.The interior is cute and a lot smaller than it seems from the outside. The service was excellent and quick, considering how packed they were for a Thursday evening. Of the dishes, my favorite was the tataki (meatball) yakitori - negima (breast meat  with Japanese scallion). There wasn't really a miss for me, although I would have preferred the rice at the start of the meal so I could have enjoyed it throughout. My only complaint really is that there are no veggies or other accompaniments on the menu, but one of the servers mentioned that those would be coming in future iterations of the menu. Super solid dinner and look forward to returning.\", \"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night and we waited about 30 minutes after putting our name on the waitlist. Definitely worth the wait!We ordered the grand opening yakitori set and everything was delicious and super filling! For $30, it is so worth your money. All of the skewers were cooked really well and flavorful, and the sauces were a great pairing. Nothing was dry or tough, everything was tender and juicy. My favorite was the heart stamina, which was a variety of chicken breast, chicken skin, and chicken heart.  We also tried the special sake cocktails. I got the hot pineapple sake. It wasn't too sweet or pineapple-y, which I liked. Service was very prompt and kind as well!\", \"Finally able to come here after the delayed opening. Overall 3-3.5 stars. Great to have a yakitori spot in jtown, service was great, but skewers are just ok.I saw the articles and read the stories, so I was really anticipating this place opening up. Came with a group of 4, and we all ordered the omakase course. But we didn't stop there, and we ordered every skewer on the menu.For the omakase, skewer size is on the larger side, so there is a good amount of meat on each one to fill you up.Paitan soup came out quick and was a good palette cleanser. Nice rich flavor. But, if you want a larger quantity, Marufuku Ramen across the way has some awesome paitan ramen.Tataki meat ball - different than the normal tsukune meatball you normall get (and which sometimes includes raw egg). Flavor was ok, meat was tender, but didnt have the umami flavor or raw egg that you get with a well done tsukune. Heart stamina - this was interesting, and maybe one of the better ones here. It is a skewer with a mixture of heart, skin, and breast.Momo & Wing - ok, good portion size, on the juicier side, but missing that umami flavor.For the ala carte skewers the seseri (neck), bonjiri (tail) were my favorites -- tender with a good fatty/juiciness.  We made the mistake of getting sasami (breast strips) which ended up being alot of the same. The breast and thigh here all taste sort of the same. Larger portion, but flavor is just all so so.Also a great surprise was the hot pineapple sake, which Ive never seen before. Manager was nice enough to tell us the history about the place. Service was amply abundant, but the place could use more time to work out the kinks on timing of food. There was a couple of rounds that took 8-12min, some that came out 2-3 minutes apart, and then toward the end we were flooded with 3-4 skewers at the same time.We ended up spending around $75pp, were more than completely stuffed. So overall more food than I expected for the price (and sure you can order less and be plenty full). A general recommend if you are in the are area and want yakitori, but if you really want that rich umami grilled flavor on blistering hot yakitori skewers that satisfies your soul, I'd suggest going somewhere else.\", \"Service was very good. The host right off the bat was very communicative about wait time, menu questions, etc. My only bad comment for their service was that they forgot our drinks.The restaurant is very cozy. My group of 2 got the Edomasa set and 2 sasami since we had eaten earlier.My favorite was the tataki-meatball. My boyfriend wasn't a fan of the rice.Overall a very nice experience\", \"One of my best dining experience in San Francisco! Ambiance is casual and authentic izakaya just like it was intended. For $30 you will get a set menu of 9 items and $5 for each special item order. They were all tasty! Service was cordial, warm and efficient.Food would not come at once altogether but come one by one as they are ready.Worth every penny! It's like having a tasting menu for $30 and I highly recommend you to come and try it yourself, I'm sure you would love it too.More restaurants like this in SF please.What a great addition to the city! Thank you for coming to San Francisco!どうもありがとうございます !!!\", \"My friends and I decided to be adventurous and try something new in Japantown instead of our usual udon, so we found ourselves at Yakitori Edomasa. Unfortunately, we were not particularly impressed. The five of us each had the prix fixe menu, along with two orders of three additional skewers off the a la carte menu (marked with ***), which was a good amount of food for our group. - Chicken paitan soup: this smelled really rich but actually tasted light and comforting - perfect for a chilly SF night.- Tataki (meatball): the meat was surprisingly really tender, but the yakitori sauce was a bit too sweet for my taste. The wasabi helped cut through some of that though. - Heart stamina (breast, skin, and heart): I usually don't like breast but this was more tender than I expected it to be. On the other hand, the skin could've been crispier. I don't like heart so I gave it to my friend LOL who seemed to enjoy it. - Momo (thigh): usually I love thigh bc it's super juicy and tender, but this wasn't super impressive imo. - Negima (breast with scallion): this was more dry and more like the breast that I'm used to and don't like lol. - Nakamoto (wing): the wing meat was tender, but the miso sauce was so salty and overpowering that I couldn't enjoy it :(- ***Bonjiri (tail): I really liked the flavor of this but wish it had been crispier. - ***Harami (belly): this was tender but nothing special flavor-wise. - ***Seseri (neck): the texture and flavor of this was soooo good! - Takikomi gohan (seasoned rice): if you don't like shiitake mushrooms, you will hate this lol the flavor is so infused in there. I like shiitake so this wasn't an issue for me, but I wish the rice had other flavors besides just mushroom. We were definitely satisfied with the amount of food we had, and it wasn't too unreasonably priced at just under $50 per person after tax and tip (prix fixe is $30). However, we also had to wait extra long to be seated as a group of 5 because the space inside is small and there are only a couple big tables in the back, and we didn't wanna split our party between a small table and the bar. A smaller, even numbered group is probably the better way to go. While I really enjoyed the chicken paitan and the seseri, everything else was pretty mid, so I'll be sticking to my usual spots in Japantown.\"]\n",

Loaded with mushrooms. The huge variety of fillings in the taxi gave it such an amazing flavor. It is sorta spicy in itself, but if you're a spice lover, ask them for their spicy sauce on the side. It makes it even better. I'd definitely rate this dish 5/5. The only downer for me was that there were only two tacos for $14, and that seemed a tad pricy despite the inflation, the location in SF, and the quality of the food. I wish there was one more taco. Maybe it's the right price and I probably didn't get the right feel of the ambiance since I came in at 11:30 AM by myself. The restaurant was fairly empty and there were less than 5 people. The lady who took my order was very friendly! I was confused if I should get another plate of tacos (sweet potato) but I didn't want to spend over $30 for a brunch meal by myself. I will definitely be back once again after another soccer game, because I want to try some of their other dishes. I rate the place 4.5/5, but I couldn't round off to 5 because of the portions for a $20 meal with tip. :(\", \"A little loud, but the food is delicious.

The chips they used were great (crispy/salted). Dinner:Beef taco: pretty delicious! Would be better if they doubled the tortilla since there was a lot on one. But the beef was tender and flavorful. Recommend this one! Concha's borrachas: DO NOT RECOMMEND. Had a very fishy sus taste. We only ate a couple bites and just didn't trust it. The chorizo didn't have flavor. Ambiance is cute and romantic! Service overall was good- a little on the slower side. Clean and the decore is cute!\", 'Finally got to try Otra! We walk by it all the time and I guess the San Diegan in me was hesitant to try this and be severely disappointed (bc we\\'re taco snobs). And I gotta say, my partner and I were pleasantly impressed. It\\'s good for what it is, this isn\\'t your homestyle/street food type mexican food. This is your \"fancy resort in mexico type\" and for that, it is good. Especially paired with their well made cocktails, thats a win. In terms of food, I recommend the beef tacos. Its not dry and has lots of flavors, ask for their habanero hot sauce if you wanna kick it up a notch. Their al pastor tacos were fine, it didn\\'t have the classic red char but it wasn\\'t bad. Drinks are dangerously good though, if you like mezcal, this is the place to try it. I liked my Paloma and my partner enjoyed his old fashion (i forget the actual name).', \"This place was very good! Not like mind blowingly good or anything like that, but a solid Mexican brunch place. Came here today with my sister and brother in law, and their pup Bailey. They have outdoor seating and it wasn't cold out (rarity in SF this winter) so it worked out perfectly. We got some chips and salsa, and I got the beef hash. My sister got the beef tacos and my brother in law got the pozole. The chips and salsa were great - only thing that could have made them better was warm chips but who cares. The salsa was certainly house made, very good kick, and surprisingly the salsa verde was a bit hotter than the rojo. My hash was nothing to write home about honestly but what can you expect, its potato, veggies and cut up beef. I guess the beef just wasn't that flavorful (didn't seem to have really any Mexican flavor to it - cumin, etc.), or tender. But it was still a solid dish. The eggs were perfectly poached with a nice orange yolk. I also tried the beef tacos and those were yummy, though my sister thought they were spicy. Brother in law loved his pozole. Will probably be back again because it is close by, wasn't busy and the service was good!\", \"Amazing little spot! The food is amazing. We had the frijolitos for an appetizer which was terrific. We are salsa and chips people but you have to try the frijolitos they are game changers. The beef and quesabirria tacos were both killer, but to our surprise the sweet potato tacos stole the show. This restaurant is a gem and even more so if you are vegetarian or gluten free. The marg's are no joke too. Make sure you stop here!\"]\n",

The new server finally took our appetizer order. That was the only time we saw him all night. As the kitchen closed he asked if we were ready for the bill. That was the worst service we've ever had. But the food is great!!!!\", \"This restaurant has been on my list for a while and I'm glad to finally try it. The interior was very cute and great for date night, girls night, or a small group dinner. They also had plenty of outdoor seating.We had a reservation for a weekend dinner and got seated immediately when arrived. The two of us ordered two appetizers and two pastas to share. There were some unique flavour combos such as the persimmon and burrata, and duck leg pasta and everything was executed perfectly. It was a good amount of food for two girls and we enjoyed people watching while eating.They have a pretty long wine list but I wanted to try a cocktail so I ordered the one with matcha foam (can't remember the name). It wasn't spirit-forward but delicious nevertheless.\", \"Tldr; cold and salty food combined with subpar service. Ideally, I'd give this place a 2.5, but I can't justify rounding up.  The Tailor's Son provides both indoor and outdoor dining experiences. The restaurant's ambiance is undeniably chic, with stylish décor and a lively atmosphere. Unfortunately, when you make a reservation, you can't provide your seating preference. I made a reservation weeks ahead of time, only to be informed by the restaurant on the day of our reservation that they'll be seating us outside (in late November). Their outdoor space is covered and has heaters on the ceiling, but it's not as effective. We were fine, but I wish they had provided more info about our dinner reservation earlier. There were 3 of us, so we tried a few items from their menu. There were 2 things that were consistent about every dish that we tried - they were all (including the desserts) too salty and were served lukewarm or cold.We ordered- **Appetizers**1. House foccasia2. Carne cruda3. Mondeghili4. Prosciutto di parma**Mains**1. Agnolotti del pin2. Rotolo**Desserts**1. Budino2. Apple crostataThe bread in the foccasia and the crostini was dry. Meatballs in mondeghili were light but salty. The gnocco frittos in prosciutto di parma were a bit doughy. The sauce for the agnolotti del pin was very watery, so it wouldn't stick to the pasta. Again, it was too salty as well. And the pasta was undercooked. Apple crostata was okay. Both the whipped cream and the ice cream were salty. The ice cream was also very rich and dense. The service was all over the place. Our server did a great job explaining the menu and walking us through the popular dishes, but after that, we struggled to get the attention of the staff whether it was for getting water refilled, or asking for a menu/check. They were just slamming dishes on our table and leaving so fast that we couldn't even get a word out to get their attention. I wonder if that's because we were seated outside and there was a lot going on inside.Anyway, we gave this place a try and most likely won't be back.\", 'Indulge in a delightful evening combining pasta and cocktails.This restaurant takes a hipster approach to classic Italian recipes, drawing in crowds with its vibrant and bustling atmosphere. Their minimalist style complements the top-notch flavors they offer, using only the freshest ingredients. Once they\\'re out, they\\'re out--there\\'s no unlimited \"soup, salad & breadsticks\" here like at some other places.I can personally attest to the risotto and cocktails, a fantastic combination. The carne cruda (tartare toast) also deserves high praise. It was absolutely delicious.', \"Visited for a Friday night date.While not my top choice for Italian cuisine in the city, it's a good pick if you're planning to hang around this neighborhood and hit some bars afterward. The food was tasty but didn't amaze us. Service was efficient even on a seemingly bustling night.They offer a great deal of outdoor seating, which we really appreciated.\", 'Came in with a reservation for a party of 3 on a Friday at 5:15pm, and were seated immediately.The interior is super cute! I love the peaceful green color all along the walls and tables. Gives off a very welcoming yet clean and chic feel.Here is everything we ordered:Crudo Di Tonno - the fish tasted a bit stale for us, gives kind of a very \"fishy\" flavor in the not-so-fresh way. I liked the grapefruit, I thought it added a nice bright acidity. Also, this dish is spicy! I\\'m not sure how the table felt about it, it\\'s an interesting touch.Toscana - my personal favorite shareable crostini for the table. You don\\'t get too much, but I liked what I got. The sweetness from the marmellata goes with the umami from the paté very well. Yum!Baccala Mantecato - salted cod, a good tummy filler.Spaghettini Nero - good, as expected. The shrimp pieces are well-seasoned, and the pasta is al-dente.Agnolotti del Plin - another good tummy filler, I think of these like veal and pork dumplings with cheese and some sauce. I liked it!With drinks and a good group of friends I think you\\'d have a fun time at The Tailor\\'s Son! The ambience is lively and welcoming, and my group had a really good time. The food was some-good and some-misses, but nothing detracted from the enjoyment of our night. I\\'d say give them a shot if you\\'re in the area and are craving some Italian!', \"Busy restaurant! Rezzies highly encouraged. They have a good happy hour too until 7pm weekdays but at the bar only. Lots of Italian influenced options. Octopus was fresh and so was burrata. Enjoyed the squid ink pasta too.Nice indoor space with open concept kitchen. Can't complain about the service, polished and professional. Hard to park as it's on a very busy street.\", \"Wonderful! Food was great. Lovely menu. Service was kinda weird. Hostess came on strong and then our waiter never checked back in between us ordering our food and getting the back. I enjoyed the setup of the restaurant as well as the overall ambiance. I'll likely be back for the food!\", \"Brunch at The Tailor's Son was a real treat. Whenever we are visiting SF our son manages to take us to  some really good restaurants. He does not believe in taking us to the same place twice (exception being breweries and bars).Daniel opted for the Italian 75 while I enjoyed my Chef's Breakfast - not your normal Bloody Mary. We both ordered the Polenta Braise (Pork Ragu, Poached Eggs, Polenta and Foccaccia) with the Pomodoro (Baked Eggs, San Marzano Tomatoes, Pancetta and Crostini). Everything was terrific and the place was quite busy. Try it - you will like it!\", \"I love tailors son on Fillmore! We came on a Thursday for Theo happy hour and were pleasantly surprised! Their pizzas are different and unique- they remind me of a thin scallion pancake with toppings vs the traditional pizza with fluffy crust you might be used to. Regardless the ingredients for the toppings are top tier and delicious. We ordered the cannoleni pasta and saffron risotto with bone marrow on the regular menu and had no regrets! The saffron pasta was unique and creamy, and the cannoleni was warm and luscious. I'll definitely come back!\"]\n",

The service was impeccable--attentive, friendly, and prompt, elevating the whole dining experience to a new level. Now, let's talk about the food. Each dish was a culinary masterpiece, full of flavor and beautifully presented. The chef has a genuine talent for balancing traditional and modern flavors, making each bite a revelation. I would highly recommend this to anyone seeking exceptional food and stellar service. Can't wait to return!\", \"They finally got their liquor license (unfortunately), so that means no more BYOB (uber unfortunate, tragic news)--but thank goodness their food still slays. I think they've moved their late night HH to after 10pm now, or maybe it depends on the day? Not too sure about this. But my partner and I arrived a couple min before HH started (officially) and they were very kind to seat us out of the outside winter cold and let us place our orders a min before HH menu officially started. I love the vibes and how loud and boisterous it is inside!\", \"Ambience - nice decor Food - hit/miss/hit miss 50/50Service- Our waiter did his job ok - no shade to himExperience - uncomfortable, we left before our last dish was preparedFood:Skewers - Chicken skin not crispy enough, too chewy. Chicken Liver was good. The A5 was tough like a block of fat, not melt in your mouth kind of A5 it was underwhelming.Spicy Scallop Risotto - Scallops cooked fine. The risotto was unedible. Someone was super heavy handed with the pepper.Mushroom tempura was good.The golden potatos were too salty.Experience - I recommend if you are either a female or you are bringing a date that is a female, don't sit against the wall or you will be eye-f***ed by staff in the back super weird and uncomfortable. The staff in the back were gawking at my partner while she was eating and it made her very uncomfortable. It was consistent throughout the meal to the point I switched seats with her and I looked and made eye contact with one of the workers that just stopped. I was glaring at him and he kept looking for a good 10 seconds and then maneuvered to look where my partner went. My partner brought it up with the manager and the manager handled it poorly and made it seem like we were crazy. Dudes were just blatantly creeping.Asked for check and dipped before the last item we ordered was ready like I don't know what they'd be doing to the food we were going to eat after bringing it u. Just turned off by the whole experience.It's about 11PM, we were the only customers eating.\", \"Small casual skewer Japanese shop - it's comforting but doesn't take you by surprise. Top 2 favorites are probably the Kaisen Don and Chips and Dip. The wasabi that came with the chip and dip is crazy good. The melon ice cream was hype but honestly underwhelming - I could just get a melon and melona mix together. Service was a bit slow but they had limited staff so I don't blame them.\", \"I came here with a friend on a particularly hot summer night for the 9pm happy hour and we agreed this place was great! We each ordered a few happy hour items, me a few chicken skewers and an uni hand roll. The portions were on the smaller size, especially the hand roll, but I couldn't complain with HH prices. The quality was all around excellent and our server was friendly and present. Because it was so warm, every table that night was offered a sorbet on the house near closing time. Such a sweet gesture!\", \"Continuing with our streak of trying out new restaurants in the city, we stopped by Nono on a Saturday to see what all the hype was about.Ambiance - Relatively small restaurant with maybe enough tables for 5-6 groups inside. Typical small izakaya feel to the space. It was a little smokey inside from all the charcoal grilling. Service - All the staff were very attentive and orders were coming out relatively quickly. It did take a while to get all of our skewers (lost count because they were coming out at different times), but it wasn't too long to be bothered.Food - I'd have to say that the food was pretty good at Nono. Very flavorful and also aesthetically pleasing. My favorites were the chicken namban, the chips and dip, and the happy melon. The yakitori was pretty good too even though I generally don't like skewers. Nono is a great addition to the Filmore/Japantown area. It has different enough offerings to the other Japanese restaurants in the area that I think it will probably be our go-to for Japanese small bites.One recommendation for the restaurant though is they really need to reorganize their menu. It was a hard to read and I wasn't completely sure what we were ordering based on the descriptions for each item.\", 'Nono is a delightful gem tucked away in the heart of Japantown. This small izakaya restaurant left a lasting impression on our dining experience.My daughter was so smitten with the gyoza that she insisted on ordering it again - a true testament to its delectable taste. And the yakitori? It was nothing short of amazing. The chicken and steak skewers were amazing! The lamb rack stole the show.Nono\\'s flavors left us craving for more, and it\\'s safe to say that I\\'m definitely coming here on every trip to San Francisco. Say \"yes, yes to Nono!\"', 'MUST TRY!! 10/10 so happy my parents brought me here for my birthday dinner. We came right when they opened at 5pm and was able to get seated right away. We ordered everything on the happy hour menu :) The restaurant is super small so there is almost always a wait so be sure to come early! Sushi was fresh, skewers were perfectly grilled, and I loved every single bite! Will definitely be back esp with their $5 hot sake', \"Woohoo.  Finally get to try NONO!  Our party of 4 came here at 5PM to catch a Monday night happy hour.  We were seated immediately and ordered almost everything on the happy hour menu multiple times.-HH Sashimi included: (King Salmon, Kampachi, Scallop, Toro, & Baby Amaebi) Scallop and King Salmon were my favorite.-HH Uni Ikura & Truffle wagyu handrolls were good but quite small-HH Salt & Pepper Skin was crunchy and fun to snack on (Free if you C/I on yelp atm!)-HH Oysters were sweet and meatyThink we focused too much on HH menu but corn on a cob, chicken skewer and chicken gizzard skewer were all a hit too.  I'd like to come back in the near future to try other items on the menu.Friendly and welcoming staff, service was a bit slow but also gave us time to conversate.  Ambiance was dark and intimate but had good music rotation.  Will come back the next time I'm in the area!\", \"Arrived for happy hour on Sunday right before 5pm, no wait. It started filling up around 30 minutes in. Got a couple chicken skewers, which were a decent deal, but I do wish they were left on the grill a little longer for a deeper charcoal flavor. I also had the ramen, which was not too special and a bit on the blander side. My partner tried one of their special beef/egg dishes and thought it was missing some flavor too. Overall, probably a good place for those new to Japanese food or flavors and want something milder, but the flavors weren't strong enough for our taste. Service was decent and interior was clean and cozy.\"]\n",

      "   Reviews: ['Got a question about Mattina? Ask the Yelp community!', \"Summary:Tasty coffee and excellent biscuitsDetails:Being our third lunch stop of the day, we didn't exactly have room for any more real food, and opted to keep it simple with a coffee and one of their butter and jam biscuits, both of which ended up being unexpected winners.The coffee itself stood out more for their beans than the craftsmanship itself, the latter of which I found a bit lacking (I mean, look at that latte art), but the former was quite excellent, with them using St Frank's beans.The real winner here though were the biscuits, which I wasn't expecting much out of when they first set them down, given it looked both dry and burnt. To our surprise though, it was one of, if not the most, buttery, crumbly, and moist biscuits I've had in the Bay area, possibly rivaling my favorites even up in Seattle proper. Will absolutely come by again just for these.Accessibility:Plenty of accessible options both inside and outside!\", \"A very beautiful space with a cafe attached to it! I'd give the food 6.5/10. It was good, just not mind blowing. Service was good, not exceptional but our server did give us some recommendations.The food tastes really fresh but lacked a bit in flavor. The cornmeal crespelle was pretty disappointing, it was cold and the crepe was not great. I really enjoyed the sugar snap peas and tagliatelle. Very solid dishes with great balance of flavors. I was very excited to try the ice cream sandwich, but it did not meet expectations. The ice cream layer was very thin and uneven, and some got the short end of the stick when it came to sharing. The sandwich part was also still very frozen/hard to bite through. Visually looks so beautiful so I wish taste was at that level.There are so many Italian spots in the city it's hard to out perform others, and unfortunately this one did not.\", \"I came here for dinner with a friend and was impressed by how they can transition from their daytime cafe to nice dinner spot. I liked how the menu included pastas I'd never tried before. The canederli was super unique - I actually enjoyed the chewy texture and flavor of the bread dumplings a lot. The arancini was a solid appetizer to precede our pastas and came with a really tasty sauce. I'd say the food is just ever so slightly overpriced for what you get. This probably wouldn't be my first choice for Italian in the area, but it's still a decent neighborhood restaurant to enjoy some good food.\", \"Overall, I'd give Mattina a 8/10. The bruschetta was the star of the show, which was a bit disappointing as we decided to dine here for the pastas. The pastas were a bit underwhelming. The octopus appetizer had very few pieces of octopus in it. Although everything tasted fine, I had higher hopes.\", \"Do you have a friend where you know dinner is going to be a feast?  At the end of the night, you've eaten so much that one more mint will make you explode.  For most people, I am that friend.  I had dinner with a great friend and colleague here.  I was really excited since both of us can put away a lot of food.  It's a really solid Cal-Italian experience.  We shared the beef meatballs, cherry tomato salad, stuffed eggplant (eggplant stuffed with eggplant), summer squash, tagliatelle, mafaladine, 16 oz beef rib eye and the choc-oat gelato and cherry coppetta.  That beef rib-eye was definitely the highlight of the meal but both of the pastas were also fabulous.  I have a slight preference for the tagliatelle though my friend liked the mafaladine more.  Service was excellent and the restaurant space is cavernous.  With tax and tip, this ended up being $170 per person - this could have easily fed four people (about $85 per person).  I am admittedly a harder grader when it comes to Italian food in SF given all the great options but this is definitely a good option when you are in this part of town.\", \"The food was great. You have to order that Tagliatelle with mushrooms & Buccatini with pesto. It was fantastic. The service was great, Joseph was very patient, friendly & helpful. We loved it so much we went back for breakfast. I don't usually eat biscuits, but Mattina changed that! It was the best biscuit I've ever had, with prosciutto, cheese & egg and seemingly truffle. I highly recommend!\", \"Came initially for the breakfast sandos, but stayed for the rest.I came in a Sunday around 10 and pretty much no line and lots of outdoor seating. They don't serve the main menu until 11. We got the prosciutto & cheese biscuit ($11.50) and added an egg (+ $2) as well as the ricotta and hazelnut honey bruschetta ($9). The biscuits were a good portion size, although wished it was slightly fluffier but otherwise good. I also felt like it needed something sweet or like a hot honey to balance all the saltiness from the prosciutto. I'm glad with hot the bruschetta because it helped to balance the saltiness. Came back for dinner another day and ordered several things to share! Cornmeal Crespelle ($19)-Crepe like and a bit softer than we expected, but I personally enjoyed it. Bruchetta ($9)- the toma cheese & pickled peppers. My friend really liked this one, but I think I liked the one from the morning better. We also shared the ravioli ($28)- which was fine, but we felt like could have had more filling and smaller pieces. The tagiatelle ($28) with mushroom and truffle, was really really good. Both of our favorites. Overall, both experiences were good! I like the casual atmosphere for brunch, but also a good catch up spot or date for dinner.\", \"Pretty quiet during the weekday morning/lunch hours, so it's perfect to come chill with a cup of coffee at their parklet or inside space. Their biscuit sandwich was savory and filling, and we paired it with their iced lattes. The workers were super attentive and checking in from time to time as my friend and I enjoyed our cafe outing! Will have to come back to try their dinner menu to see how else their food is like.\", 'Tried this place for the first time today. The food was tasty, though the portions were a tad small for the price. Great service. Would love to come back again!', \"Exciting new Italian restaurant in the Filmore that's a bit on the pricey side. Most of the pasta entrees are $27+ and the proportions are sufficient for 1 serving, just barely. I ordered the yellow corn ravioli and the tricolore bruschetta. The ravioli had a yummy creamy sauce it was served with a spoon because there's more than just the ravioli (garnished with plenty of yellow corn, red pepper, and okra if i remember right).The service was great - the server was very knowledgeable about items on the menu and very responsive. And the atmosphere is really nice. It definitely feels like a modern, upscale spot. There's plenty of bar seating to go along with the table/couches. Looking forward to trying their morning menu as well!\"]\n",

And then the crispy mochi and French toast were show stoppersHighly recommend!\", \"Here at Horsefeather right now, a friend and I came in with a reservation for drinks at 6 and were seated promptly. One hour and two drinks later, we are informed by the host, a taller man with blond ish hair, that there is another reservation in 30 minutes. I have ample experience being a restaurant host, and it should be common knowledge for all hosts that 1 hour/ 90 minutes, is a very normal time to dine/socialize. Never in my life have I been told to hurry up in such a passive aggressive manner. Honestly if this is the way business is managed here, with speed instead of the customer experience, I will not be coming back. The timing of others' reservations should never be put on the other guest's mind.

We got the Korean chicken wings (delicious!), Spiced Cauliflower (Yumm) and pork tacos to share.  Recommend adding one more taco if sharing this with someone else.  We also got the whiskey cake.  Food was delicious... been here a few times and the bold flavors never disappoint.  Drinks were great as well.  One area that could be improved was the service was mediocre from our server.  He rarely came by our table, and the hostess noticed and kept checking on if we needed anything else which was appreciated but awkward.  Hopefully it was just a one off night.', \"I came to visit for a happy hour WFH. It's a very cute spot to work/study. Menu has cocktail + WFH style drinks!

Waitress was attentive and helpful. Menu is small. Space for brunch wasn't packed which was nice. Indoor seating is a bit dark, so we opted for outside. They also have parklet space. Outside seating was pretty and open, perfect on a nice day. All plates were great. My favorite was the eggs. Just melt in your mouth delicious. Chilaquiles were next on the list. The French toast had tasty filling. A bit more lemony. Mochi was good but the umami for me didn't provide a great after taste. They have alcoholic and NA drink options which is great. Overall, great brunch spot.\", \"We decided to try this restaurant located along Divisadero for dinner and I'm glad we did. Horsefeather sells both food and cocktail drinks. We walked in on a random weekday night and were seated at the tables. There is also some covered outdoor seating available. It is pretty dark inside, so it was a little hard to see the menu/the person you're eating with. We ordered the:*duck fat fries*fried chicken: A must try! It comes with 2 sides-- kimchi mac n cheese and deconstructed elote. The kimchi mac n cheese wasn't too kimchi forward, but a good amount of cheesy. The fried chicken itself was tender, juicy, and crispy. I still think about this fried chicken*tuna ceviche (vegan): I'm not sure what ingredients they used for the fake tuna, but the consistency was pretty comparable to actual tuna. All of the other components in this dish were so fresh and paired nicely with the tortilla chips. They also gave very generous portions of avocado! For drinks, we ordered:*low rider (rum, hojicha): I was interested in the hojicha aspect of this cocktail, but it didn't taste too herbal/tea-based at all. It's a solid option if you want a less sweet drink *ramblin' mandarin (mezcal, hibiscus): the combination of smokiness from the mezcal and sweetness from the hibiscus cancelled out  I will definitely be back.\", \"I've been looking for a reason to visit Horsefeather and the moment finally arrived when a friend wanted to take me out for a birthday brunch. I scored close street parking on a Saturday morning, which was clutch, and got seated in the atrium while I waited for my friend. While I waited, I had the breakfast punch and an order of the crispy mochi at the recommendation of our server. It's not something I would have ordered otherwise, but we really enjoyed it. I was torn between the chicken katsu sandwich and the burger, but was persuaded into getting the sandwich. It was good, but the flavors didn't blow my face off which I was seeking, so next time I'd try the burger. We shared an order of the duck fries which were delicious and my friend enjoyed her meal.

I've heard nothing but good things about this place since it opened and I had to try it for myself.My party of 4 got there around 7pm on a Tuesday and waited in line for about 30 min before getting inside. Once you're inside, you order at the counter before sitting down. There's not a ton of seating and the servers made it very clear where to sit (helpful for making sure everyone is funneled through quickly). The curry sounded delicious on a cold windy day but it was sold out by the time we got there. I opted for the fukuoka signature and it was equally beautiful as it was delicious. Chewy noodles, juicy chicken, and perfectly fried gobo tempura. I tried my friend's mentai udon as well - fresh and fishy (in a good way). Definitely not a flavor I had had before. While I'm not a huge fan of places you have to wait outdoors in line for, I love that this is a casual place where you really go just to enjoy the food.\", \"When I came here on a Monday night, there was a short line outside, but my group got in within 15 minutes. Once we were let in, we were directed to the counter to order. The service was friendly and quick! The inside is nice, but there aren't many tables. I heard that the wait can be long on busier days.The menu has both hot and cold udon options. I saw they even have one vegan option! I ordered the Kakiage udon from the hot section. The udon came with a shrimp tempura and a root vegetable tempura. The noodles were a little thinner than I was expecting. It was all pretty light! Not too greasy and heavy.I thought it was a high quality and tasty meal, but I'm not sure that it would be worth a long wait if I came on the weekend. The cold dishes seem more special, so I might come back to try those!\", 'Oh bummer..! I wanted to like this place. My sister saw this restaurant online many months ago and she urged me to go and try it. I was finally able to make my way over and was there for dinner with some friends last weekend.We were so excited because 1) udon! And 2) there wasn\\'t a line. Two things were already sold out (the curry and another one, I don\\'t remember), but we were able to get a range of \"dishes\" anyways. I got one of the cold udons with the daikon, another friend got their hot udon with dashi and another their tan tan. Unfortunately both the cold and hot soupy udons were bland in flavor. I quite like light food, my family is Cantonese so we eat a lot of plain steamed food and don\\'t use a lot of seasoning, but this was very subtle and one dimensional.. disappointing. The tan tan was the best, flavor wise. The noodles themselves however, were great! The texture was lovely, but the rest of the dish wasn\\'t able to add anything.', \"A must-try if you love udon! Their dishes aren't super greasy/heavy, they're relatively affordable (for SF), and offer a decent portion size. I think out of all the udon places in the city, the udon noodles here are my favorite. They're silky smooth and bouncy without being too chewy. Everything here tastes very fresh too! We ordered the Tan Tan, Kakiage, and the Niku udon. Niku Udon: I found it underwhelming because it's seasoned quite lightly. The beef is thinly sliced and lightly salted/seasoned. The gobo tempura was the best part in this bowl though. I've never had gobo deep fried before and it added such an earthy depth to the bowl. Kakiage: The presentation of the fried tempura on top is absolutely beautiful. The broth is light and the Japanese citrus peel in the broth adds a nice freshness. Just a nice classic tempura udon. Tan Tan: This was my favorite! It's spicy, saucy, and extremely savory. The soft egg on top adds such a rich creaminess to the noodles. Definitely a unique udon offering and I think it's worth trying. The dining + ordering style is very casual here. When you walk in, you order and pay at the register. When you sit down, you leave your receipt on the table with the number showing so they can bring your order to you. You can order drinks at the register and there's a water station as well. The cold noodle menu looked very enticing as well. I'm looking forward to coming back when the weather is hot for some refreshing cold noodles! Overall, this is a solid place for a casual meal :)\", \"Quick Summary:- Small interior, so tables fill up quickly- I ordered kake, delicious but light portions for me- Be on the lookout (in this case, hearing) for your number to be callledAs a person, who loves udon, I had to try this restaurant. We went on the day it opened around 4:30pm, and I wanted to go there the moment it opened. From some of the photos I saw on yelp,  there was a line out of the block. We arrived near the vicinity of the restaurant close to its opening time. We seized a spot in line and it looked hopeful, that we were included in the first group to eat.When the time rolled in, the staff came out with the noren (the curtain that symbolizes that the restaurant is ready for operation) was set out, and they gestured us inside. Happily, we were indeed the first group to eat, so we claimed a seat. Each of the tables had a nice little basket underneath to place bags. We wanted to focus on the broth and the noodles, so we chose the kake udon.This was my first visit, so I'm not sure how accurate this is, but the wait time for the order until the food arrived took some time. It could be that we entered the restaurant when it just opened so things were still being cooked and boiled. If I recall, they call for your number, so listen closely to your order.The broth was gentle but flavorful. Perfectly light for what I imagine a udon to be. This was great in the cold weather but since the broth was so light, this might also be good for the hot days.My favorite part of this dish was the noodles. Upon appearance, it was cut evenly and it was glistening. The noodle was cooked to a beautiful transparent sheen. The chewiness was powerfully bouncy, and it was great to slurp it down. The only downside is that because there was a waiting line out the door, I felt a sense of being rushed to eat and leave, but that is not something the staff can improve. If you are feeling like chatting, maybe it's easier to do it while waiting for your order.\", 'New udon spot that opened on Divisadero! Fresh udon and fast service. Come early, the line gets long! We arrived around 5:30 and my party waited about 15 minutes prior to ordering and being seated. Once we ordered, the food came out within 10 minutes.The Curry -- fresh veggies with beef, onsen egg, and a delicious curry broth. I  really enjoyed all of the veggies present in the dish. It was a little unconventional with all the veggies present, but they all complimented each other and provided a fresh and earthy taste to the dish. There was not much beef itself in the dish, but I was not terribly hungry. The noodles themselves had a softness and chewiness that differentiated Katsuo + Kombu from other restaurants that serve udon in the city.I hope to try some of the cold udon options in the future!', \"It gets the job done if you're looking for a chill bowl of udon - something light but substantial, maybe some warm soup for the impending cold - but I wouldn't wait more than maybe 30 minutes. I got the niku beef udon and I did appreciate the note of yuzu in the broth as well as the accompanying gobo tempura which was fun to eat!It's no Marugame Udon but a welcome addition to the sparse amount of udon options in SF.\", \"Pro-tip: If you want to evade the long line and wait, just order ahead on Toast for pick up! We did this and was able to enjoy udon at home without any fuss. The udon is super well packaged - whether you order hot or cold noodles. It looks like you might even get a bit more tempura in take home orders when comparing to Yelp photos. And everything taste better in PJs at home in my opinion.I personally enjoyed the Fukuoka signature cold udon and it was everything that I look for in cold noodles. Bouncy chewy noodles with perfect crisp gobo tempura. The chicken tempura was especially tasty with a great savory marinade. The broth was deeply flavored and not overwhelmingly fishy like other places I've tried. I don't know if I would say it's worth the wait when other local business in J-Town have very similar caliber of udon. But, it's 100% worth it to try it at least once!\", \"Was told by a friend that this place was something I should try for an udon spot and my ears perked up. A spot on Divis with usually a line, but I just happened to show up at 6pm on a Monday and was able to order at the counter and seat down immediately.FOOD:Niku Beef. Just a classic udon style. Soft flavorful beef, with decently bouncy udon and a sweet, savory and light broth to tie it all together. The hint of fresh tang from the Japanese citrus was possibly my favorite part. Can't go wrong. The Gobo tempura was possibly one of the better parts as the tempura itself is quite good and the flavors just balanced so well with the soup. Definitely worth trying.Tan Tan Dry. Definitely wasn't expecting this but had a saucy spicy flavor which was pretty good. A little salty, but overall the mix of textures and flavors just gives their menu a different aspect, so it has it's place, but I don't have to have this again - worth a try, but not really what I go to udon spots for.Mentai Yamakake Bukkake. Cool, refreshing and clean. The flavors work pretty well with the saltiness of the broth. The minced shiso leaves hidden in the green onions do wonders for the dish. All mixed with a little bit of citrus makes the flavor profile one to get when you're feeling hot. The texture with the sliminess may not be for everyone though.Shrimp Tempura. Got this as a side because I just wanted to get more things. Honestly probably one of the best things on the menu. Fresh shrimp cooked to perfection with a light, flavorful and crunchy batter. Possibly perfection.Overall a solid spot worth trying. Udon itself has the bouncy feel with the unevenness that you can only get when you hand make them which is oh so good. Extremely friendly staff that is accommodating. Just the price is a little high for the portions, but overall definitely worth trying as the flavors are pretty solid.\", \"I love udon and this place did not disappoint!! There is always a line but it moves pretty quickly. I went on a Tuesday night and wait was around 20 mins. The space is pretty small but the staff does a great job at organizing everything. I got the Kakiage udon and I loved it. The noodle texture was perfect and the broth was on the lighter side, but still flavorful. I tried a bite of my friends Dan Dan udon and it was sooo good, definitely will get that next time I'm in the mood for dry udon. Overall one of my favorite udon spots in the city and I will come back to try them all!\"]\n",

      "   Reviews: ['Food was really tasty and staff were friendly. Great for takeaway. We got a range of noodles and other dishes and everything was great.', \"Dumpling kitchen is delicious! Their pork xialongbaos were amazing. I usually compare any soup dumplings I try to Din Tai Fung's, which in my opinion have the best ones. These ones were pretty similar, & the outside was only slightly thicker than dtf's. Their string beans were crispy & tasty. I'd also recommend trying the chashu buns, they were so soft and probably the best ones that I've tried. Their hot and sour soup was also excellent. It wasn't too spicy, but the vinegar flavor was soo good. I also love the jasmine hot tea that they give with the food. The inside is pretty small, but it wasn't crowded when we went on Saturday afternoon around 2:30. You can also put your name on the Yelp waitlist before you arrive.\", \"Solid 4 I'll shorten the review by saying this. The items that they're known for (dumplings) are very good. Probably one of the best XLBs I've had in a while.The salted yolk baos and pan fried baos were solid too.Now what I would pass are the other stir fry dishes, the ones I got at least which were the chicken wings and the braised tofu. They weren't bad by any means it was decent but not good enough for me to order them again since they are made better at other Chinese restaurants.My husband was also surprised by how good the savory soymilk was! Would order again!!6 dishes came out to about 80 something with the cash discount (3%?) so it was more expensive than I was expecting. ~close to $100 with tipTLDR: would come back again for the dumplings and dimsum but not the stir fry dishes\", \"I had heard glowing reviews about Dumpling Kitchen and was excited to try their famed dumplings. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the limited options for non-pork eaters like me. The anticipation for their well-known Shanghai-style dumplings was dashed when I realized there were very few non-pork dim sum choices, except for a few pan-fried options that didn't appeal to me. Ultimately, I ended up not ordering any dumplings because of this.Opting for the chow mein, it was alright but a tad too salty. The service was relatively prompt, yet the waiters seemed inattentive unless you specifically called for them. While the food might be delightful for meat-eaters, the variety for vegetarians or non-pork eaters is notably restricted. I wouldn't recommend this place if you have dietary restrictions or are looking for vegetarian or non-pork options.\", 'Busy on a Sunday.  Taraval streets are a mess right now with limited parking due to street construction / resurfacing.  Recommend:- XLB- Fried Meat Dumpling- Sliced Rice Cakes with Pork & Preserved Veggies', \"Pan fried pork buns stole the show!! It's juicy and very CRISPYYY, probably the best shen jian bao I've ever had. The black bean noodles were salty and delicious as well, very different from the Korean style that I'm used to. Service is great, and the restaurant itself is as expected from a hole in the wall asian place aka flies  buzzing around means the food is bomb !\", \"Went with a big group and the staff were so incredibly accommodating, helpful and kind. Some places get frustrated with big groups but Dumpling Kitchen was very friendly and patient throughout. The restaurant was busy, and our food still came quickly.I thought that the Shanghai-Style Steamed Pork Dumplings and Shanghai-Style Pan-Fried Pork Buns were a bit thick (skin wise) and weren't wrapped around the meat tightly enough. The flavors of the fillings of all the dumplings though, were delicious, including the Steamed Vegetarian Dumplings and Wontons in Chili Oil. The Pork with Preserved Vegetable Rice Cake was nice as the rice cakes were chewy and soft. The Beijing-Style Noodle in Black Bean Sauce was well-balanced, not too salty. The Five-Spice Beef Stew Noodle Soup had a really flavorful broth. The Mapo Tofu was good, not spicy at all though. The Walnut Prawns were delish -- succulent shrimp paired perfectly with the crisp walnuts. The Dry-Braised String Beans and Cucumber Salad were okay, but I loved the Eggplant with Garlic Sauce.\", \"In our last trip up to the Bay Area, we were actually trying to get some quality dim sum and ended up at Dumpling Kitchen in the sunset area as our third choice. We were too lazy to battle other eager diners for coveted dim sum tables. The nice thing about Dumpling Kitchen being in Sunset is that it was super easy to find street parking mid morning when we arrived.The restaurant was maybe 60-70% full and so we were able to snag a big table in the back. We ordered an assortment of dishes: ha gao and shu mai (because we were craving dim sum), xiao long bao, steamed BBQ pork bun, pea sprouts, and salted yolk bun. The dishes trickled out a bit unevenly with the pea sprouts coming out first and it seems like they batched steamed the dishes at our table together, so then a bunch came out altogether at once.Somehow the sticky rice and mushroom dumpling got mixed in our order even though we didn't order it. And that, along with the xiao long bao, the other dumpling dish, were probably the most lackluster. Disappointingly the xiao long bao was lacking in broth. The standouts were the pea sprouts and both the steamed buns, the BBQ park and the salted yolk. The bun texture was fantastic and not soggy where it sticks annoyingly to the back of your teeth. The fillings were delicious, esp that yolky one. Be careful biting into it because it's piping hot. I had to cut it in half and wait a minute before consuming.\", \"Came here on a Tuesday night and it was fairly busy, but I was able to get a seat right away. The staff here were super attentive and all of our food came out very fast.I ordered the green onion pancake, steamed pork dumplings, pan fried pork buns and the black bean noodles. Everything was super good and flavored well. The steamed pork dumplings and the pan fried dumplings came out super hot, but when I bit into it, it was more room temperature which was a little misconceiving. However, I paired these dumplings with their house made vinegar and it was still very delicious. I think the star of the show for me was the black bean noodles. The noodles had a perfect chew to it and they definitely didn't skimp out on the sauce! Overall a great dumpling spot with large and reasonably priced portions!\", \"I've found my new favorite dumpling spot in the Peninsula. The service here is amazing! They're very friendly and quick to seat you and serve you! We have tried a good amount of dumpling places around our area and this one is at the top! The only down side is finding parking, but that's with most restaurants in the city. It's in a safe area though and the ambiance is great. Overall, their dumplings taste SUPER fresh and homemade; the same with their baos! We even got the chicken & corn soup to try it out and that was delicious too! Can't wait to return here and bring my friends & family!\"]\n",

Once I got there, the lady (boss? i think) was super nice saying to just put my name down on the waitlist and said it would take about 15 minutes. We (party of 4) got seated and the lady (same one) said to us very enthusiastically \"ITS COLD. I\\'LL GIVE YOU SOME MILK TEA.\" She proceeded to ask us what flavors we would like, sugar preference, even asked us if we wanted pudding or lychee jelly. We all went along with her and gave her our preferences, thinking all of this was on the house. I guess it\\'s also our fault that we didn\\'t clarify but it turned out to not be free. I just wished she would have told us that it would cost money. We all ended up spending $24 on drinks that we wouldn\\'t have ordered if it wasn\\'t on the house. Other than that, the food was good. I got the sichuan beef flavor that\\'s 3 fire signs but tasted like 1 fire sign. Kinda gross tho because one of my friend had a piece hair that\\'s not from the head in one of their side dishes. Aight TLDR- don\\'t get scammed when they say lemme make you some milk tea and double check if it\\'s free or nah. ngl the milk tea is good but not good bc i feel scammed. ya knur?? food was good.', 'We ordered the tomato beef soup and green pepper fish fillet soup. Both were delicious, but if you are looking for something with more of a kick, I would definitely order the green pepper fish fillet. The drinks were also really refreshing and the decor was cute! There was a small line when we got there but we got seated after 15 mins, so the wait was not bad at all. The owner and everyone there were all really nice and were constantly checking on up us.Would recommend for anyone who is in the spot to try it out!', \"Noodles are my obsession -- so when Oodle opened up, I knew I had to go.The spicy sichuan noodles did not disappoint. Portion size was great, the soup was flavorful, and the juice drinks were great too! (this is coming from a guy who almost always gets beer with his noodles).The staff were friendly and easy to talk to. Food came out quickly. The store was clean and cozy. I'll definitely be coming again. (Their menu tastes great to-go as well, which is a hard thing to achieve for noodles!)\", \"AMAZING!!! I am so glad that I've found this place!  Came here on a Saturday afternoon around 2pm and was seated quickly.  Owner was friendly and offered some tea. We wanted noodles and knew that we would be too full if we drink tea.  There are many soup options..I ended up selecting spicy pot.  It was delicious!! The broth was deep and rich without any heaviness.  I love display of side dishes and vegetables.It's a small restaurant- clean, cute and very casual.  Service is very good and friendly. I cannot wait to come back!\", \"A new place on the block! Definitely popular. To break it down it's a cute, 6 tables, clean, quick service and warm family run restaurant. Menu is limited but has something for everyone. Big value for money!So the concept is similar to hotpot but it's just real hot soup with sides and noodle (deconstructed noodle soup)The most spicy soup on the menu was flavorful, not too spicy. All ingredients felt fresh and well served. I was going to order chicken soup which is creamy and non spicy but I opted for pickled pork soup instead which I definitely think was a better option. We ordered Popcorn chicken, garlic fries, lychee smoothie with cream(highly recommend) and pandan milk tea (least fav order) and the total came up to $55 + TaxIf you're looking for fresh, healthy meal you should visit!Thank you for the warm service. See you'll!\", \"tldr; this is a new restaurant in the richmond! come here if you're craving delicious, piping hot rice noodle souprecs: popcorn chicken, green pepper noodle soup with fish fillet (if you enjoy mala flavors)Oodle is a beautifully decorated rice noodle restaurant new to the Richmond community as of the end of October. The bridge with ten different side dishes to add to your noodle soup is one of its unique qualities and made my dining experience here super entertaining. For ~$25/pp, my friend and I left this restaurant positively stuffed with popcorn chicken to go. As someone who constantly craves mala flavors, I loved the green pepper soup. The broth was also scalding which makes it a great dine-in experience and a perfect option for rainy days in the Richmond. Tip: try the chili oil at the table with the fish fillets -- it's super tasty!Service was super attentive. Someone who looked like the owner was going around making sure guests were happy with the food. We got our waters refilled several times. My friend and I are already thinking of our next trip back here when the cold weather returns to SF. :)\", 'Came in on a Saturday at 2PM with a party of 3- we ended up waiting 30-40 minutes to be seated as it was busy. There were two benches for us to sit on while we waited. Once we were seated, I ordered the Crossing Bridge rice noodle as I was looking for something more light but filling. Food was solid and I loved the little plates of food on the bridge and how they were presented. Ate the whole bowl swiftly and appreciated how I could customize it with the sides. Although the wait was a bit long, the food came out swiftly and I thoroughly appreciated a good bowl of noodle soup for a rainy day. My friends ordered the tomato beef brisket rice noodles and chicken rice noodles and also enjoyed their meals. My order came out to be $21 including tip.', \"Located just nearby Devil's Teeth is Balboa St's new noodle place! It's quite small inside with about 20 people seating so if it's busy.... it'll be a wait!We came on a Saturday during lunch with 3 groups ahead of us and we waited for about 15 minutes for table of 2. Service was prompt and engaging throughout the entire meal! I ordered the sichuan spicy broth with beef. The components of the soup are presented on a bridge which I thought was super cute! The beef and noodles are all served separately, so YOU are in control of what and how much goes into your soup. The beef was yum and I thought a lot of the side add in's were just ok. The sichuan broth was kinda sichuan-y but not really spicy so it wasn't really up to my expectations of a sichuan spicy broth.Worth checking out in the area!\", \"Small little rice noodle house! It's ran by a lovely couple and they're are so nice. The restaurant is relatively small with a limited number of seats. Arrived around 7pm for a party of 5 on a Sat and luckily a large party happened to be leaving.I ordered the Yunnan Spicy Small Pot Rice Noodles and it was perfect for the cold weather! Mild-Medium spicy and since it was served in a pot, the soup stayed hot for a long time. Once they serve the soup, dump the noodles and small dishes in. Also had the popcorn chicken, cucumber and cold tofu (forgot to take pic). My favorite was the cucumber since it was very flavorful and the peanuts added a nice crunch!Service was attentive and the owner came to check in with us multiple times. Highly recommend!\", \"Walked by and ordered a popcorn chicken because we were craving a quick little snack. I have had it before and it was pretty good. I got it again and this time it was slightly less salty which was lack of flavor. But everything else was good cos it was hot. Wish it had more basil as well. I also had to ask for pepper (they don't have it in the togo option). The boba was decent but was big and didn't finish. I will come back next time but ask for more salt if it isn't salty enough. I haven't tried the noodle soups yet so I will have to!\"]\n",

      "Reviews: ['Went to Bottega for a date night and let me tell you it was amazing. Had a reservation so did not have to wait long, once seated the waiter attended to us right away and we were able to order. Food is amazing and so fresh! Drinks were good too. Highly recommend for a cute little date night.', \"Everything was great! Food, menu options, staff & vibe. It's nice to have a traditional Italian restaurant that isn't stuffy or way over priced\", 'We had an amazing experience at Bottega! The food was delicious and the service was exceptional! We tried several dishes and none of them disappointed! I would highly recommend and I will definitely be returning!', \"Bottega surprisingly had dishes that seemed unique to other italian restaurants I've been to. The interior was pretty dark and they actually have these table lamps that they turn on for you, with just a bit of ambiance on the ceilings and walls. I got a seat with my two friends in the back corner so I didn't have too much incentive to look around. It was the day before Thanksgiving so maybe we got really lucky with the timing and managed to get a seat. By the time we were done, the restaurant was about to fill up.Their complimentary bread is very good. If I go to a restaurant and I enjoy their bread, it speaks volumes from my perspective. They have dried tomato in some of the pieces which adds a light kick. Olive oil on the side if thats your thing.I got the salmon fettuccine and it was pleasantly soft to bite into the salmon. Most of the time I get a salmon dish at italian restaurant, I often get displeased that the fish has been cooked too long. Then again, not my recipe. They add this sauce which they refer to as 'pink' and I'd say it makes the whole dish creamier. Not too bland, and not too overpowering. Really enjoyed it. I didn't try the other dishes but I didn't even recognize that my friend got ravioli so A+ for how their dishes stand out! The two tables next to me had my head turned every so often to look at the dish they ordered.I'd say if you are in the area and are craving some italian food, definitely try this spot out! I'd come again on a date for sure. The service here is excellent as well since they often come to check up on you.\", \"This place is a solid 4.5 with a perfect experience and good food! They don't take reservations, so it's usually just a wait, but luckily on a Sunday night, there was no wait. Sara was our waitress and was very nice, and she knew all about the food, joked around, and gave us good recommendations. The atmosphere is darker and intimate, but also very lively despite not having a wait, so it was definitely a place that people seem to enjoy! I have been here before, but did enjoy it the first time so wanted to try it out again (looks like I forgot to review this place the first time!)They gave complimentary bread as starters, and you could easily get lost finishing it while waiting for your food. Not sure how fresh the bread actually is, but it was buttered and warm. We ordered the Sacchetti and the Quattro Formaggi Roman pizza, and I was so surprised that this place actually split the pasta into two dishes for you to share! The Sacchetti is unlike anything I have tried before, and would say it is one of the dishes to try here to see what it's like. They are like tortellini/ravioli filled with cheese with hints of sweetness like pear, and then with some walnuts to add a sense of earthiness and crunch. It fills your mouth with all textures and flavors, and really does feel like a balanced pasta dish even though the ingredients are so simple! The Roman pizza was also very nice, a great amount of cheese but still with distinct flavors from the different cheeses they use. For dessert, we got the Tiramisu which I thought the cream was great, but just felt on the dryer side as it felt like the lady fingers could have been soaked more like you would have for a classic tiramisu. Last time I came here, I remember getting a pink sauce pasta, but that was on the tangy side and not something that I really remember, so I need to try it again next time I come to give a proper review of it. But the portion sizes were good and the service was great!Overall I think this is a solid modern Italian place in SF! I think the food and atmosphere is great to continue to visit again and again, and I don't think I'll find a dish like the Sacchetti anywhere else!\", 'I highly recommend a daytime visit to Bottega to immerse yourself in its enchanting interior, featuring captivating pink hues, wood finishes, rose gold accents, cascading flowers, and exposed brick--a perfect backdrop for dressing up and capturing beautiful moments.The food was yummy, and my friends enjoyed their meals too. I ordered garlic bread which was perfectly seasoned -- not too much, or too little. I also enjoyed my gnocchi with pesto sauce.  The pesto sauce was made into a perfectly creamy blend and not oily/greasy. Gnocchi can oftentimes be a rich and heavy dish, but they somehow made it light. The service was kind, and attentive. My water glass was always full. We were regularly offered refills of complimentary bread, and this bread was so soft, warm, and flavorful. It was a highlight on its own for me. Additionally, the wait staff surprised me with a happy birthday song, and panna cotta with a candle. Sooo thoughtful, and brought a smile to my face. Thank you!', \"This is truly a beautiful restaurant with gorgeous pink hues and floral accents.The complimentary bread, a rare treat nowadays, was quite good. Our waiter made ordering our meals such a breeze by offering  insightful recommendations. I opted for the Mezzemaniche Boscaiola with pink sauce, it was so delicious! The staff's thoughtful gesture of singing Happy Birthday for my friend's birthday and presenting a complimentary panna cotta added a thoughtful and sweet touch to the overall experience.\", \"I mean... come on, if you walk pass this place, you are instantly sucked in by the open concept giving you a full view of their bar and alcohol selection with the aromas of delicious food being cooked and served. Bottega has always been recommended by my coworkers so I had an opportunity to take the family a few weeks back. Nicky, our server, was so welcoming by treating us like we were regulars. She made recommendations, told us the special of the day, and also took note of our daughter's food allergies. Kids were being basic yet again, ordering a pasta with butter and another one with meatballs. My wife and I shared calamari fritti, lasagna and they were kind enough to split the branzino for us. Food was fantastic with the branzino being the highlight of our dining experience. Fish was cooked to perfection, capers and potatoes were a nice touch, and everything was seasoned perfectly! I would come back just for this!Cocktails were tasty and beautiful... solid wine selection as well! Thank you Nicky for making us feel so welcomed!\", \"Ordered to go on Yelp so unsure of ambiance. Delivered fast. I did the build your own pasta. I did the rigatoni with garlic, chicken, and pink pasta. The pasta was Al dente for sure. Barely taste the garlic: chicken was dry. Pink pasta sauce taste store bought like or like frozen food. The second one was the Ravioli, garlic, mushroom, onion, Italian sausage, and bolognese sauce. Ravioli is good. Didn't see any onions and i paid extra, barely 4 slices piece of mushroom and paid $2 extra, no garlic flavor,  but there was a lot of Italian sausage pieces. Sausage is bland. The sauce basically taste like spaghetti O ravioli sauce the one you can buy at Walmart. Most likely would never order from here again. Doesn't taste fresh, authentic, or has much flavor. Didn't come with utensils, so make sure to ask for it.\", \"This is my favorite place to get pasta in the city or to order on DoorDash! It's so aesthetic, perfect for dinner out with the girlies or date night. Depending on when you come, there may or may not be a wait. There is an option to add yourself onto the Yelp waitlist remotely which is convenient. We always get wine to pair with our dinner. My two go-to pastas are the:*amatriciana: the spicy tomato sauce with the guanciale is so good; the perfect combination of spiciness with warm pasta*mezzemaniche boscaiola with pink sauce: the pink sauce is so creamy and flavorfulParking wise, it can be a little difficult to find street parking. There's also metered parking all around. It's overall a cute spot in the mission to try out!\", 'No Fees', \"The ambience here is so great for a date night or a night out with friends. I ordered the truffle ravioli with burrata salad. Let me just say the truffle ravioli had me coming back for more the following weekend. It's now one of my go to pastas. Also, need to mention that they serve complimentary homemade focaccia?! im obsessed. A must try if you're in SF!\", 'good simple Italian fare with solid pastas and pizzas. no gimmicks needed, just the type of place you and a few friends would enjoy sunday dinner together family style.  Amatriciana was the standout here, no pancetta substitute here, guanciale all the way!Food: 8/10Value: 8/10Service: 7/10Vibe: 8/10', \"Delicious Italian off mission street! Their whole menu looked yummy so it was tough choosing. Went with the lasagna and wasn't disappointed. The first bite was so cheesy and scrumptious and brought a smile to my face. They also give you complimentary bread which was an awesome great. Love this place!\", \"everything was great, big portions, great taste, two dishes of 30$ came out to 60$ and not 100$ like in every other restaurant. Even got a free pannacota for my girlfriend's birthday and they sang happy birthday. I cannot say about many places that I will come again, but definitely will come to this place again in the future.\", \"Came out for a much-needed date night and Bottega was the perfect spot to go to. First off, the decor is amazing. Florals everywhere and a cute neon pink sign, it meets the needs for both girl brunch and romantic date night. We chose a seat by the open window so we could enjoy the warm weather and people-watch during our meal. For the food, we started off with the burrata alla caprese which is essentially just a caprese salad but with burrata instead of mozzarella cheese. Very creamy and refreshing, a nice way to start off the meal. They also bring out complimentary house focaccia throughout the meal which is buttery, soft, and savory. For my main, I decided to get the gnocchi with the bolognese sauce while my husband opted for the sacchetti. My meal was definitely the heavier and filling of the two - they don't skimp on the portion of pasta and the meat sauce is rich on its own. While my husband's meal portion is probably not enough to fill up someone who is pretty hungry, the dish itself was fantastic. I'm normally not a fan of blue cheese, but the combo of blue cheese, pears, and walnuts was spot on. The dish comes in a white cream sauce which pairs very well with the other flavors on the plate. A must-try. Even when I'm full after my meal, I'm a sucker for whatever dessert item looks unique. Here, it was the limoncello mascarpone cake. I was a little worried it would be too much on the lemony side, but the lemon flavor was actually just the right amount. Mixed in with the fluffy cake and the creamy mascarpone, this was the absolute perfect, refreshing yet satisfying dessert to end our meal. Bottega is a must-try! Looking forward to our next visit.\", \"I came here for dinner with a party of four around 7:30pm on a weekday and were able to get seated really quickly! I loved the decoration inside but it did feel noisy and was hard to hear my friends talk sometimes. We ordered an appetizer, two pastas, and a pizza to share which ended up being the perfect amount for all of us. Both pastas (mezzemaniche boscaiola and gnocchi) were good except the texture of the noodle was too firm for my preference. The flavors overall were great though! The bruschetta and margherita pizza were also fine but didn't really stand out to me compared to the pastas.\", \"Wow. That was soooo amazing. The chicken Parmesan was perfect. The salmon Alfredo sauce was great, salmon cooked perfectly. Also you can't skip the lemon cake. Perfectly balanced, not too sweet\", 'Tried Bottega for dinner for the first time. The decor is really cute and I can see it looking amazing in the day time as well. We got the vegetarian croquettes which tasted really good and went well with the sauce. All of us got pastas and to be honest, we thought they were too al dente. The pastas were pretty thick and heavy so might have been a good idea to get something lighter along with the pasta. But this place looks like a great spot for celebrating special occasions and everyone was nice overall.', \"We came in for a weekday dinner. We were able to call shortly before coming, and had a table reserved for our group of 8. The inside is super cute and there's a good amount of seating. It's also spacious so it doesn't feel cramped at all. We each got a pasta and some apps to try. We really enjoyed whatever we got, and the pasta portions were super reasonable. Will definitely come again.\", \"I remember ordering Bottega during the pandemic and I wasn't happy about it. I didn't rate it at the time because I don't think it's fair to rate any spot solely for take out so I decided to stop in today while I was in the Mission. At first sight, I was very impressed with the decor. There were flowers everywhere and it seemed like we were transported to a garden in Europe. The ambiance was 5/5. The food however was lackluster. The focaccia bread tasted stale. You could tell the pasta was made in house, but still something was missing. The size and shape are atypical of what you would normally expect for pasta especially the spaghetti noodles. I was excepting a chow mein type noodle but was given a fettuccine type--this is just my personal preference but it threw off my experience. The rigatoni in the arrabbiata sauce was my favorite.\", 'No Fees', \"Their Friday and Saturday night hours extend to midnight now! Super lively energy even late at night (it's hard to find food spots open after 10pm in SF). Good vibes for parklet seating and indoor tables too Ordered the prosciutto burrata pizza in person for takeout, and it was really easy and only took 10 minutes for them to make! Came with red pepper and Parmesan on side.Pizza is a nice focaccia texture, more of a hefty bready bite flatbread but still soft/chewy. Burrata was so creamy. I thought there could have been more flavor outside of a saltiness, like a fruit, pesto, or pepper accompany the toppings.Would likely come back to try their pasta next time and get cocktails if with friends.\", 'Be ready to become transported to Italy when entering. We came on a weekday afternoon, and luckily no wait. Very cute and trendy ambiance. So nice to take pictures of. Our servers were quick and food came out not too long afterwards Everything was so delicious. Craving their pasta as we speak. A must try in the city.', \"The ambiance here is spectacular and so is everything else! My friends and I grabbed some drinks at the bar while we waited to get seated for our party of 5. It was a Monday, so we got a table fairly quickly. What I tried:* Garlic Bread - This usually comes with 4 pcs, but our waiter added 1 more since we had 5 people. Such an amazing simple appetizer!* Crab Cakes - I'm usually not a huge fan of crab cakes, but these were great. They had a nice crunchy exterior but the crab meat was not dry and had a great flavor. * Amatriciana - The pasta was perfectly cooked and smothered in this delicious spicy tomato sauce. I personally wouldn't have minded a little more spice but it was amazing still. * Gnocchi in Ragu sauce - The gnocchi was so fresh and basically melted in your mouth. Would definitely come here again to try it with all of the different sauce options. Going to be adding this spot to my favorites and will be coming back again soon!\", 'We stopped in for some drinks and a few appetizers. The pomodori and funghi bruschetta were very tasty. The toasts were a great size. We also got the croquettes and they were probably my favorite. The drinks were just ok!', \"I'm glad to say that Bottega lives up to its hype and isn't just for the aesthetics! If you're ever craving pasta, Bottega is the the place to be.SERVICE (1000/10): My mom and I loved our server Nicky! She radiates such a beautiful aura which went hand in hand with our first time experience at Bottega. I also do remember her vibing to Mama Mia with the table next to us. Truly iconic! Learning our preferences, mine was wanting a nice creamy pasta while my mom was craving something with seafood-- she was able to recommend 2 solid dishes. We ended both ended up getting the Pomodori Bruschetta for our appetizer, Sweet Dreams mocktail, along with the Mezzemaniche Boscaiola with Pink Sauce and the Pasta special for our entree. FOOD (8.5/10):- Bruschetta Pomodori: had a nice crunch to it, it was good but we've definitely had better. - Mezzemaniche Boscailo and Pasta special was truly delicious and didn't disappoint! I could say that the pasta was fresh and cooked to perfection, the portions filled up and these both were packed with so much flavor! Sweet Dreams mocktail: Personally loved this drink so much, it kinda reminds me of an Orange creamsicle but in liquid form. So good! Delicious food and reasonable prices is what we all love! AMBIANCE (10/10): - So cute, clean and beautifully decorated! Perfect for a date night or brunch with the girls. Overall, I would say it was worth it and definitely be back.Side note: Parking is super limited due to it being street parking! Thankfully it wasn't an issue for us!\", \"An amazing Italian spot with delicious food and great service. We were a bit worried about the long wait on Friday night as they don't accept reservations, but thanks to the really effective work of the hostess we were seated in 10 minutes after arriving. The ambiance of the place and the service during our dinner was great as well. We went with salmon fettuccine and eggplant parmigiana and really enjoyed our plates. Portions were generous and sauce's just delicious. I also liked the Valencia Dream cocktail - gin based with a fresh note of strawberry is a perfect combination. So our overall experience at this place was very good and i definitely recommend it to everyone who is looking not only for delicious Italian food but also for the ambience\", \"Really great service and amazing food. Came here for my friend's birthday dinner and it was perfect choice for yummy Italian. Prices are affordable and portions are adequate. They gave her a complimentary tiramisu which was a nice and thoughtful touch.\", \"Amazing! We wanted a good meal after attending an event and was happy to have discovered this place as a late night eatery. So glad I found it on Yelp because it did not disappoint! We arrived around 10pm on a Saturday night and was able to grab a seat instantly. They have indoor or outdoor seating, we chose inside. The ambiance is super cute with the pendant lights and floral decor. Even the dining chairs were cute. For drinks I ordered a sparking rosè. It was perfect, not too sweet, not too brut. To start we shared a ceasar salad. We told them that we wanted to share and they split it for us on two separate plates! That was super helpful and we definitely made note. I ordered the black truffle mushroom ravioli. It was great!!! I'm glad the hosts provided me with an idea on how good it would be. His recommendation did not disappoint. The flavor of the truffle was strong, which I like! The mushrooms were minced and paired good with the sauce and truffle. Highly recommend! Overall I will be dining here again for sure. Parking is limited to street but luckily I didn't have any issues finding one close by.\", \"Came with my girls for a girls night out. I had checked here on yelp and it said they don't take reservations, but when we got there they said they do take reservations. So maybe its a case by case? But lets get too it, the location has terrible parking so be prepared or take a ride share. but the restaurant is super cute! love the summer italy look of pink, pastel flowers every where.I opted for the pesto gnocchi, and the girls all got the lobster ravioli, it was table favorite, and i dont blame them. We had lots of bread, salad and the burrata ( a must have in my opinion)lastly we had the tiramsu for dessert and it was so creamy and delicious.Definitely a must try.\", \"This place is so pretty, from the outside to the inside. We went and there was no wait, not many people seated. However, the service was great, I had chicken parmesan which is my favorite dish, SUPER good, I loved it, my husband had salmon pasta, he wasn't a big fan, but thats okay. We love to try new places. We had dessert and omg it was so good, I don't remember the name (look at pictures). Overall we liked this place. PS they have a huge pepper grinder lol\", 'No Fees', \"The service here was excellent. The vibes are trendy. The food? Average at best. Calamari appetizer was tasty but nothing special. Had some rigatoni pasta that was too al dente. The arrabiata sauce is good but added some additional spice. Wouldn't fully recommend but if you're in a pinch this spot will do.\", 'I loved everything about this place :) we went with friends without a reservation and were immediately seated, so that was the first win! Friendly service, gorgeous ambiance and amazing decor. it has seating indoor and outdoor.In $130 (before tip) we got:- free bread 3/5 for the table with condiments . I would save my calories for main course- eggplant pasta which we customized to add grilled chicken and make the sauce spicy 5/5- vegana pizza - 4.5/5 - loaded with veggies and just the perfect amount of cheese and crispy !!- calamari 5/5 - loved that it came with some veggies in it and made fresh not oily calamari with a yummy pink dip- virgin mojito - skip it- valencia dream cocktail 4/5  - pink gin based yummy- sweet dreams - 5/5 sweater and the best one i liked- sunset cocktail - 4/5Sadly, the big black pepper (star of the restaurant) was broken and the new one was to come in by next weekend. Its still in the store so we saw it but not in usePS- they dont have air conditioning in the indoor seating just so u know!Clean cutlery and tables, full bar and chic seating. Definitely coming back for more. I think i will try their tiramisu next time.. stay tuned and \"Meet me at bottega\"', \"The service: 10/10.  The ambiance: 10/10.  Food: 6/10. I've been dying to try out this spot for so long (the IG videos really got me hyped up for it).  I don't regret trying it because it was such a cute little spot, the vibes were really immaculate! With that said, I definitely don't think the food was THAT great.  The bruschetta was good, not amazing but pretty tasty.  I absolutely LOVE anything with truffle in it, but the mushroom ravioli was just alright - the black truffle sauce was very thick but sadly didn't have much of that truffle flavor that I was expecting.  The pesto was the exact opposite -- very runny and a complete lack of flavor. I don't even think the pasta had any salt in it, let alone any other spices.  We had to ask for something spicy like chili flakes just to add some sense of flavor. Also, the music was SO freaking loud at this restaurant. On a Tuesday evening. At 6:30pm.  I literally found myself shouting across the table to talk to my friend.  There's really nothing I hate more than loud club music at a cozy restaurant -- it just doesn't make any sense conceptually.  Anyways, not sorry that I tried this spot but I don't know if it was worth the hype.  I might be back to try a pizza of theirs someday, but I'm in no rush to return.\", 'This was such a beautiful restaurant! It got pretty noisy as me and more people arrived for dinner so having conversations was a bit challenging. However, that was the only con. The staff were wonderful and attentive. The food was satisfying and portions were great! I asked for recommendations on wine paring and was not disappointed. Would definitely return to try more menu items.', '- Calling this my #1 favorite Italian restaurant- Friendliest and most attentive staff- Seats available inside and outside the restaurant- Dishes appear small, but it is filling- What is that amazing spicy sauce?- Walking distance from the 24th Mission street BARTI have tried a few Italian restaurants before, but none has truly given me a wonderful experience like this one. Actually, I\\'ll compliment further, this was the best restaurant experience I ever had from any food category. The staff were the best at sharing us recommendations, special menus of the day, clearing the plates and tables, checking in from time to time to ask us if we are doing great, every aspect was so lovely.We arrived at the restaurant to have a delicious and good time, and Bottega delivered. I would like to give the rating 10+ stars if I could.Bottega has been in my bookmarks since I first saw the restaurant while walking around Valencia street. I love the warm and pretty interior decorations of flowers and the soft pink colors. I always recall the restaurant filled with people, so we decided to get there as early as possible. We entered 30 minutes after it opened and there were more seats than I last recall from my last visit in Valencia street. Along with tables, bar side tables, there is also outdoor seating.The staff welcomed us and asked whether we wanted to sit inside or outside, and we opted for inside. The view from the inside is so pretty! The light from the outside is just right amount to filter through the tall windows. The staff handed us a menu; the front side is the food and the other side was the alcoholic drinks. I did wonder, hm, where is the coffee and the dessert, but that was well orchestrated by Bottega.While we were deciding, the staff mentioned about a special menu of minestrone soup or the pork chop, and we were intrigued with the minestrone soup. We ordered three dishes the Amatriciana, the prosciutto pizza (saw this from yelp photos), and the minestrone soup. As the food was being prepared, the staff asked if we were planning to share the dishes, and explained the unbelievably long pepper grinder we witnessed from a different guest.The minestrone arrived first and then the Amatriciana pasta. The staff came by and asked if we wanted more cheese, pepper, or the spicy sauce on the side. We asked for the spicy sauce on the side -- and yes, we needed to ask for more pepper. The pepper grinding was so cool and fun to stare at. xD I have a pepper grinder at home, but this one was almost as tall as a young child. Where did they sell these?The minestrone soup was very smooth and rich with flavor. My relative, who loves dishes with vegetables, praised this a lot and really enjoyed this soup. The vegetables in the broth were cooked so well, so soft, that light bites were enough. I might have wished we ordered another bowl, so we\\'ll keep that in mind for next time.I was blown away with the spicy sauce when paired with the Amatriciana. What is that magic? There is a drastically amazing difference when tasting the pasta before adding the spicy sauce versus after. Before, it is good, but it also felt hefty. I sprinkled a little bit of the spicy sauce, and all of the sudden the flavors elevated and the dish became refreshing? It was like a magic transformation. Also, despite calling it the spicy sauce, it wasn\\'t spicy even for me, who has low spice tolerance. The pasta noodle was cooked al dente, so there was an evenly smooth chew on each bite. The prosciutto pizza arrived while we were still eating and being amazed by the Amatriciana and the minestrone soup. It was cut in 8 pieces and each slice has prosciutto, cheese, and a cream that was particularly my favorite. It was milky and balanced out the salt from the prosciutto. On the first bite, I first tasted the salt, but it evened out in the end of the meal. Due to how thin the prosciutto is, this one was the hardest to eat out of the others. Prosciutto is not an easy piece to eat.We were feeling full, when the staff handed a petite dessert menu. Now, before this arrived, I told my family that if they offer me a dessert I will say \"yes,\" So, yes, we ordered dessert. Here, the staff explained the different desserts and pointed out the staff\\'s favorite. I decided to go for the staff favorite, which was the third one in the list, after the panna cotta. (I tried my best to look by the search engine but I couldn\\'t remember what it was called). We also ordered the panna cotta.The panna cotta was so good, the cream is so milky and melt into the mouth. I loved it a lot. Strawberry puree covered the top and the slightly sour and sweet strawberry complimented perfectly with it. Man, it was crazy because we were full moments ago, but the heaviness disappeared the moment we took a bite of the desserts.I also loved the other dessert. It is slightly heavier than the panna cotta, and I love the yellow custard.Yelp told me I\\'m at my word limit.', 'I\\'ve been wanting to try this restaurant after seeing/hearing lots of great reviews. It\\'s super cute and serves up many IG worthy pictures. Parking is obviously street parking. They have outdoor and indoor seating options. I was able to walk in without reservations. Love that they keep a wait time posted on their yelp. You can add yourself to the waiting list before arriving.They serve complimentary focaccia break that you can dip in olive oil. The bread was alright but I always appreciate complimentary bread. I ordered the ravioli stuffed with mushrooms in a black truffle creme sauce. It was divine!! The pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce was decadent! Would totally order it again. Unfortunately, our waiter wasn\\'t very friendly. He gave off moody \"I hate my job\" vibes. After handing my friends and I our dishes he quickly dashed off while I was mid sentence and never checked on us. We had to hunt down someone else for chili flakes and the check. Regardless of the service I would return and probably try their pizzas next! They sound delish.', \"Service was great! Came in a group of 12 at opening time and there was almost no wait (5-10 mins). They gave us a private room upstairs so long as we cleared out in 3 hours since there had been a reservation. During our time there, the restaurant filled up pretty fast but we got our food in a timely fashion and there was always water and bread at the table. However, I was not the biggest fan of the food. Bread was meh the first round and a little on the drier end, but subsequent rounds were better. I don't like brussel sprouts at all but their brussel sprout appetizer might have been my favorite thing. The lobster ravioli was too sweet and a bit too fishy for me. The salame pizza was on the saltier end, and the amount of oil pooling up in the toppings made me uncomfortable. I had bites of some other people's pasta and it was better (pasta with pink sauce and veggies, pasta with white truffle sauce, etc.).PS: parking is really hard to find on Valencia street. We parked at a garage near Dolores and walked over.\", 'First time here and looking to try their pasta dishes after looking at thru reviews. Their cocktails were really good and the pasta dishes were as expectedly delicious. They serves focaccia bread when you arrive and they were super soft to dip in olive oil. Their decor were super trendy and their service were attentive and friendly.  They are pretty close to 24th Mission Bart station if you want to arrive through public transit.', \"I was craving for pasta and wanted to check out this place on the mission. I'm not sure if Italian foods are generally salty, but most of these dishes were salty. Besides the appetizers, the main courses were too salty for my liking. It's a cute restaurant with outdoor dining as well. Aside from the food, I think our waiter was a bit forgetful or wasn't as attentive when we needed his attention. They didn't really care to pick up empty glasses or plates from our table which somewhat bothered me considering it's a small space with plenty of dishes that we ordered and had to make room for. Not sure if I'd return anytime soon, but if I do, maybe I'll try their pizzas.\", 'Bottega is well reviewed; my dining experience was not as pleasurable. We ordered a couple appetizers. The crab cakes, four to an order, were miniature in size; the menu states they are famous, & my companions & I joked, \"Famous to who?! Famous where?!\" The fried artichoke heart with garlic aioli was pretty good; you can\\'t go wrong with a fried veggie, let\\'s be real. I ordered a Margherita pizza & added salame. Our waiter kept insisting I was ordering the Salame pizza; I wanted the fior di latte of the Margherita & not the smoked cheese on the Salame pizza, but the waiter was not listening. The pizza was the menu item I least enjoyed. The porky taste of the Salame lingered & did not go well with the cheese. My main dish was the Chicken Parmesan with nicely al dente rigatoni pasta. Generous piece of chicken with a flavorful, not-too-thick breading, but this one mildly-decent item, in light of the other disappointing dishes & the aforementioned pizza debacle, is not a reason to return to Bottega The pink & floral decor was eye candy for my group, & the impressively-gigantic pepper grinders provided many laughs & inside jokes for years to come, so there\\'s the silver lining to dining at Bottega.', 'No Fees']\n",

Great spot!', \"Ambience was amazing 10/10 so classy clean modern, service was very welcoming, fast and beautifully put together, best of all the food I had was delicious, I orders the filet mingon best steak I've had\", \"I live just around the corner in Marina and wanted to try this new spot. Don't let the lack of guests inside steer you away (it's brand new) -- This food was EXCELLENT. Some of the best I've had along Chesnut Street. And the servers were incredibly attentive and kind.\", \"Excellent service!! Came here for my birthday with a group of friends. I highly recommend this restaurant. The crew sang happy birthday for me and provided a yummy dessert. The food was amazing! I had the grilled salmon. They also have a huge selection of wine. Alina and Berry served us and they were wonderful. The ambiance is very nice and classy. It's perfect for a birthday dinner where you can dress up and take pictures after.\", \"It was such a great experience! Seems like they just opened a few weeks ago, and we would highly recommend! Everything from decor to food to service to location and the restrooms were on point. We sat outside, and it was the most beautiful sunny day to dine outdoors. Esvet was so awesome! We got the beef meatballs, linguini, beet salad and key lime pie. I hear the pie is a 20yr old recipe, and it definitely didn't disappoint. Soooo yum! Coming back for the bread pudding next.\", \"Wonderful restaurant and experience in the Marina.  Ambience is great (although it is a bit noisy - just FYI).  Very pretty restaurant with comfortable chairs and great location!Service was impeccable!  Everyone was extremely nice, servers were attentive and the timing was perfect.Food was very good.  We started with the prawn appetizer, I had the salmon and Mr. had the linguini.  Judging by the way he scarfed that down, I would say it was a winner!  Salmon was good along the yummy vegetables served with it.  The prices are not bad either.  Most entrees are in the 20-30.00 range.  The starters and salads are less than 20.00.  Next time I would love to try their beet salad and skirt steak so we'll be back!\", \"We happened to be walking by looking for a lunch spot this Sunday and noticed this new beauty! They opened two weeks ok just off Chestnut street on Steiner. The gorgeous interior decor and furniture  caught my eye. We essentially ordered the entire starter menu minus the prawns . The most delicious item was (allegedly) a butternut squash gnocchi, but tasted more like a delicious Alfredo to me! Pasta was cooked perfectly. Wish I didn't have to share it ;pThe boys really enjoyed the steak tartare despite and exorbitant amount of cheese on it. The calamari was sadly inedible- super dry and cheery. Berry our awesome server kindly removed it from our bill on her own. Burrata heirloom salad was good! Just feel like plating should be reconsidered. Each tomato slice was pretty huge and somewhat awakes to cut. Meatball was a hit as well, delicious sauce. They serve wine and beer as well and I could not stop loving the flower ceiling we had outside. For just their second week up and running, they nailed it. Will definitely return!\", \"We had a great time at Bagatella for dinner. The restaurant is beautiful inside, and our server was friendly and attentive. To start, they provide complimentary house-made bread with truffle butter. We ordered the steak tartare, broccolini, pan seared chicken breast, and seafood linguini. Everything was delicious, but the standout was the steak tartare, which was some of the best we've had in the city. We will definitely be back for that dish alone. They also provided a key lime pie on the house for dessert, which was such a nice touch and a very delicious end to the meal. This definitely a great date night spot, and somewhere I'd take friends for a more intimate dinner.\", \"Ambiance is super cute, great for lunch and/or date nights. The staff is very accommodating and attentive, they will keep your glass filled and your stomach full. Food is delicious, I had the penne chicken (not pictured because I got hungry), everyone enjoyed the roasted chicken, salmon, and the steak. Everything's was cooked to perfection, you can tell that this business truly cares and they check on you to make sure that you're well taken care of. I'll definitely be back with friends, family, dates. Thank you for hosting our party and making it a great experience for us!\", \"Title: A Culinary Gem in SF Marina - Bagatella Shines Bright!Review:From the moment I stepped into Bagatella, the new culinary sensation in SF Marina, I knew it was going to be an extraordinary experience.

The service is amazing. From the host, to the server, to the owner they're all very kind, friendly and personable! The ambience is unbelievable. Truly an instagrammable restaurant!! We started with a beet salad, burrata and heirloom tomato and steak tartare! By far the best steak tartare I have ever had!! Must try!!! My favorite starter was the Gnocchi!!! It's a must try!!! I had the spaghetti meatballs *chefs kiss* as the entree and my friend had the filet mignon! The filet mignon was cooked to perfection!!! For dessert we had tiramisu, key lime pie and crème brûlée!

One of the best dining experiences I have had in a long time! I plan to come back here very soon can't wait to try everything on the menu!\", \"Our server Esvet is a legend, bubbly personality and extremely sweet to our puppies. We sat outside with 2 dogs & ordered 3 sides of grilled chicken for them. For the humans we shared the meatballs, the sauce was just perfect. Sweet and seasoned to perfection. They also served warm bread with yummy truffle butter. I had the seafood linguini and he had the special sacchetti pasta. See attached photos, beautiful presentation, plating, choice of table wear and ambiance. I can definitely see this as a cute date night location. They just opened and it's a overall very nicely done\", 'I had a great dining experience with my wife last week. Charming design, delicious food, great service (Thanks Berfin), and reasonable price. What else I can ask?This place is brand new. If they keep going like this, I am pretty sure it will be a treasure of the city.', \"out with the old in with the new. bagatella sports a vast menu with many options to choose from. if you're into an American, french, or italian taste this will be right up your alley. the city needs this new life that an establishment like bagatella brings to the neighborhood with the thoughtful decor and modern finishes, on top of a great dining experience.\", 'Bagatella is a new restaurant in the Marina that is a must try! The ambiance is superb, with indoor and outdoor seating. The food was amazing and the service was fantastic. We got the Steak Tartare and Burrata as an appetizer along with Skirt Steak as an entree. Special thanks to Dave & Abe for their amazing service. The evening was everything we hoped it would be. I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely be coming back.', \"Agree with all previous reviews.  Arrived early for our table and we're accommodated with a table by a patient and friendly hostess.  The restaurant's seating configuration makes it seem much bigger than it is, and kitchen is off a back corridor so the dining area felt very cozy.  Lovely modern decor, soft lighting.  Our server was wonderful...very pleasant and attentive.  Didn't rush us.  Food was delish!  The meatball appetizer was tender and flavorful.  The beet salad was also tasty and refreshing.  Our entrees wereserved piping hot-seafood linguine and skirt steak.  Dessert was divine-bread pudding-best we've had.  Absolutely coming back over the holidays with the family!\", 'This new spot on Steiner has only been open for a month and I was very impressed by the service, ambiance, and the food. The appetizers were better than the mains (imo) but everything was great. The standout was the steak tartare for me. They also play great music and the staff are friendly. Would definitely come back for dinner and drinks.', \"Was startled to see that a beautiful new restaurant had opened in the old Saiwalks (and Askew way back when) spot on Steiner, so decided to check it out.  Had no idea we'd be one of the first customers during their soft opening!This place is going to stick. Great design, crowd pleasing menu and fantastic food.The interior is modern, trendy and gorgeous.  Hard to believe that it has been a fast casual restaurant for the past few decades.  LOVED the dishes/glasses/flatwear.  Nice parklet.  Everyone who worked there was incredibly gracious and excited to see us.Menu has some nice bistro breadth and offers something different than most other places in the Marina.  A few salads, a few pastas, a few meat dishes...something for everyone!  Since it's brand new, here's the rundown:Bread with truffle butter:  A++.  We had a long argument about getting a second serving or not and finally caved.  Really delicious!Butternut Squash Soup:  Outstanding.  I don't usually like butternut squash, but loved this soup.Tomatoes and Burrata:  Tasty and beautifully presented, could have been just a little larger.Goat Cheese Pasta (forget the name):  Beautiful stuffed pastas (sort of tortellini like) with a little honey mustard on the inside that set it apart from anything you've had before.  The chef and server both told us this is their pick for the top dish.Skirt steak with truffle mashed potatoes:  Yum!  Fantastic pan sauce that I wanted to mop up with the extra bread (though found the will power to restrain myself).Spaghetti and meatballs:  Really delicious meatballs and a hearty portion.Tiramisu:  Very good, you won't be sad.Only constructive feedback is that the wine list could use a bit of elevation.  It's pedestrian (lots of names you'll find at Safeway) with a hearty, though not outrageous markup.  No cocktails; didn't read the beer offerings.  They'll get this figured out and this place is going to rock.  $150 for three of us...not crazy.Check it out soon.  It's definitely going to be a neighborhood winner!\", 'This place is next level with the quality and service and ambiance. The food is very tasty, made with so much love not your typical Italian cuisine. Berry was very a lovely hostess she took care of us and recommended the best dishes. She stuck by and made sure we had a great time. Must try!', 'I was in SF for work and because it was also my birthday, my wife decided to join me. After a disappointing Italian meal in Vegas, I was determined to find something good in SF. While there were initially just a few reviews for Bagatella, the place lived up to the hype. The area is still a reminder of what San Francisco is all about and this place is a perfect fit. As soon as you walk in, you can tell there is something special happening. Beautifully decorated from the flowers over the outdoor seating to the super comfortable chairs at the table. Dave and his staff were super courteous, attentive and made my birthday a celebration to be remembered! The food was amazing with the soft bread and truffle butter being a highlight of the meal. We saw this pasta selection with a honey mustard based sauce but did not order as my wife is not a fan of honey mustard. It was certainly a chef specialty as they brought us out a sample and it was divine! Of course the seafood pasta and my filet were amazing as well. To top it all off, they presented me with a birthday dessert that turned out to be one my favorites...key lime. Combined with the wonderful singing, I was truly touched. If you are in the area, give Bagatella a shot as it was not overpriced and worth every penny.', 'No Fees', 'Went to this new gem in the Marina this past weekend, and was blown away by the entire course. It was a calm ambiance to begin with and became very live halfway through our stay. To start, we had their fresh heirloom tomato and beet salad, then onto a rich and creamy gnocchi, steak tartare in a delicious truffle oil, and my favorite main dishes--pan seared juicy chicken breast and a scrumptious sacchetti pasta. Our server Berry was a lovely addition to the entire night. She was welcoming, super efficient and made this experience unforgettable.', \"Bagatella is such a wonderful addition to the neighborhood! While it was the awesome vibe that first grabbed our attention and lured us in for dinner, it's the amazing food and service that have us so excited to go back. The steak tartare was one of the best we've had (and it's a dish we order a lot). Our seafood pasta was delicious as was the beet salad. And I'm still thinking about the incredible warm bread with truffle butter. The restaurant decor and ambiance is stunning - you can tell how much intention went into each decision from the sleek modern seating, unique flatware, and beautifully decorated outdoor space. With such great food, friendly staff and a chic atmosphere, this place is a must try!\", 'Bagatella which took over the saiwalk space looks like a total transformation.  We were there in the thanksgiving afternoon for the first time and it was a very pleasant surprise.   We order beets salad, roasted prawn, ceasar salad... etc.  Everything was simple and expertly prepared. The decor was beautiful, modern and elegant.  I would bring some friends back and try other food.', \"My friends and I dropped by Bagatella recently and it was such a treat! The place had a great atmosphere - awesome music and stylish decor.Now, let's talk about the food! We started with the squash gnocchi (a big hit), Caesar salad, and beet salad. All of them were absolutely delicious.For the main course, the pan-seared chicken breast was the standout dish. It was bursting with flavor - a definite must-try.To end our meal, we had a cappuccino and tiramisu. Both were fantastic. Shoutout to Dave, our waiter, for his attentive service and spot-on recommendations.We had a fantastic time and can't wait to come back for more!\", \"They brought the 5 stars to SF back.

We ordered a bunch of appetizers, and the standout for me was the squash gnocchi. Absolutely delicious! For the main course, I would highly recommend the filet mignon and the pan-seared chicken breast. Both dishes are extremely flavorful. For dessert, I would recommend the tiramisu and the key lime pie. I loved both so can't really choose just one. We would like to thank Dave for his friendly service throughout the evening. Such a fun time, we will definitely be coming back soon.\", \"Opened just two weeks ago! This new restaurant in the Marina is beautiful, ambiance is on point! Service is amazing and food is impeccable! Must try when you're in the area!\", 'Excellent food and wonderful stuff. They really take the time to make sure you are happy with the food and service. We brought our nephew and he enjoyed his meal along with my husband and I. Our server was the best. She was amazing. Enjoying great food!!', 'Absolutely perfect!  Excellent service.  Beyond excellent.  The food was perfect.  The decorum was lovely.  After a long day it felt great to be so pampered.', 'No Fees', 'Food was great quality and plating was aesthetic. The decor and ambiance makes for a super modern and sleek and cool vibe. The service was so sweet that they even treated us to their lemon tart dessert which was 10/10. Shoutout to Elena for the amazing service and care for our evening dining. Will recommend and for sure be coming back again!', \"I had the pleasure of checking out Bagatella in SF. It's located in the Marina around Lombard street so the location is super popular and cute! The interior decor was lovely, super modern. I loved the accents of greenery and gold throughout the restaurant. Really well done on the design. Now the foooood! I tried out many of the items on the menu, and it was all SO tasty. The butternut squash gnocchi was one of my favorites! The sauce consisted of Gorgonzola cheese which is my FAV type of cheese, and I always give props to restaurants that take the risk in using such a pungent cheese. It's dangerous! But Bagetella incorporated it beautifully. The burrata did not disappoint. The beet salad was so fresh and packed full of flavors. I loved the Caesar salad as well. Simple, yet really delicious because the romaine lettuce was super crispy which I love. Acing a simple dish is harder than it sounds, and they definitely pulled through! Now for the main meal. I had the Sacchetti Pasta. This was phenomenal! The honey mustard with the mascarpone sauce was the perfect combination. Inside each tortellini is a mixture of pear and cheese (if I remember correctly) so the blend of sweet and savory was perfect. Finally, had a lovely and creamy latte. Perfect size too. Not too small, not too big. Big shoutout to Dave our waiter! His service was phenomenal. He was always attentive, always filled our waters, and asked us how everything was as we finished each course. If you're ever in the mood for a lovely dinner with friends, colleagues, or a partner, I highly recommend Bagatella. Can't wait to come back!\", \"Omg. I can't believe they are open today. It was great. If you are looking for a place for good food,  drinks and classy dining experience, you should check out the restaurant. Another great place for Marina district.\", \"Tried this new neighborhood spot tonight and it didn't disappoint! Broad menu that was good across the board - from skirt steak, to salmon, to pasta. The truffle butter and warm bread to start was a nice touch too. With perfectly attentive service throughout and a nice ambiance. Pro tip, ask to try the bread pudding for dessert!\", 'This ambience is phenomenal. Menu is on point. Great wine list including by the glass. I ordered the filet mignon which was great but my wife ordered the chicken and wow that was mind blowing. Do not miss the chicken. Ask for Berry as your server. Phenomenal job and very attentive. Thank you!', 'I had an incredible dining experience at this restaurant! The food was absolutely amazing - we ordered the skirt steak, wine, chicken, and sacchetti pasta, and every dish was a delight. Dave, the owner, made the evening even more special with his personal touch. The service was top-tier, and to top it off, since it was my birthday, he surprised us with complimentary key lime pie and tiramisu. A 5-star celebration!', 'Wonderful ambience. Excellent food. Tremendous service. There was an issue with a flickering light on the wall and the owner killed the light ASAP. I will come back often.', 'Modern style dinging with great craftsmanship in the kitchen. The linguini and red beet salad were super delicious. Do not miss the gnocchi in gorgonzola crème source before you indulge the main course. Go for the orange crème brulee to finish a nice evening. Great service and attention to detail. Loved the modern dish sets.', \"So excited for this new addition to the neighborhood. The atmosphere is lovely and the food is delicious. I loved the Beet and Goat Cheese salad!

      "Reviews: [\"My bestfriend and I went to this restaurant before a show and it was such a great choice! Our server Christine truly went above and beyond, making sure we ordered things we'd like and even remembered when we told her we had to leave at a certain time to catch our show. Wish we could've talked to the owners to let them know how amazing she was! She and the other staff made the experience so much more memorable. For apps we ordered beef and cheese empanadas and arugula salad. For mains we ordered the beet rigatoni and mushroom burger. We also ordered 3 diff cocktails, all very well made, but the 10/10 fave was the black noir. My friend who doesn't like sweet drinks was so in love w the black noir cocktail, so highly rec. Overall food was super good, but my fave dish was the beef empanadas!!The atmosphere of the restaurant was aesthetically pleasing and cute. I hope they end up getting full bar service, so FYI they only have soju based cocktails, and wine I believe. Which was great, but I do like more typical cocktails as well.\", \"Lovely staff and service and the drinks were amazing but the food was just okay. I really want them to be successful but the flavors need some punch.The rigatoni was wild but pretty good. Steak was good not great. The chicken was pretty good. Beef tacos were our favorite app. Dessert we didn't order but the offerings seemed odd too.\", \"We went here last night since we live a few blocks away.  Service was 5 stars, never had to ask for anything but some of the menu items need to be reworked - our food was mediocre at best and a bit overpriced for what we got.  Thai Curry Chicken was definitely missing something (it was very bland).  Noticed someone else gave the same review but wasn't even acknowledged by the Manager.  Wasn't a fan of the chickpea puree since it just made the already bland curry sauce even more bland.  Could have used more vegetables and flavor in the curry sauce as well.  Salmon was served with a block of beans which seemed like a strange choice instead of some seasonal vegetables or something with more flavor and color.  It was a brownish piece of salmon with brown pile of refried beans....Not sure we would go back here again.\", \"Memento was a great spot to meet a friend for drinks and dinner. It has a cozy chic vibe, shareable plates, and amazing cocktails. The mussels are the best I've ever had with a decadent, creamy sauce made of Thai coconut milk, white wine, lime and curry. The Salmon Tartare was great with the avocado on the bottom and ponzo aioli plus the side of crispy, fried empanada chips. We also really liked the Crispy Skin Salmon which had great flavor and went so well with the side of fava bean purée. The coconut fudge pie was fine but a little chewy for me. I personally loved the cocktail menu as there were so many inventive, soju-based drinks. We ordered two of the sweeter, fruitier ones, the Berry Me and the Holiday on the Moon (topped with a cookie!) They were also low-ABV though they tasted so good that I definitely drank more than usual.\", 'Cool new spot in Noe for an upscale dining experience.  Service was spectacular right from the time we got there and loved that they welcome everyone with a complimentary shot (tasty and not too strong).  For appetizers we ordered the flatbread, salmon tartare, beef and cheese empanadas, and zucchini fries (special for that day).  The salmon tartare was my favorite as it had a generous portions of salmon and avocado.  The flat bread kind of reminded me of a soggy microwave pizza and was my least favorite.   For mains we had the beet rigatoni and the curry chicken.  I appreciated the originality and presentation of the rigatoni, but it was somewhat light in flavor.  The curry chicken also felt like it was missing something. For desert we had the lime mouse and the flan.  Both were excellent and were devoured in minutes. Overall, they have good food and even better service.  We enjoyed our meal and would consider coming back.', 'Great food, engaging service, super cool ambiance. The owner was working behind the bar and provided fascinating conversation all night while serving up delicious food and wine with a Brazilian panache.', 'Such a lovely new addition to the neighborhood. We were seated at the bar and had a great time conversing with the owners and other patrons. Raf is an artist behind the bar and takes great care in his preparations, while Suhair is the life of the place! We had the Zucchini sticks and Salmon tartare for appetizers, the Crispy chicken was a main course followed by the Flan. Everything was delicious but the standouts for us were the Salmon tartare and the Flan. The drinks were also very well made and we will back here soon!', \"Came with some friends on a Thursday night. We made a reservation ahead of time, which I would recommend because it's a small space. We were greeted with a shot of a specialty drink of theirs, which was very nice. We ordered a variety of appetizers- loved the Shishito peppers and the zucchini fries (off the menu). I ordered the salmon as my main and my boyfriend got the rigatoni. The salmon was solid, but if I could order only one thing again, I'd get the beet rigatoni- it was the perfect combination of flavors!\", \"This is IT! The perfect neighborhood eatery. The food is delicious. Approachable but elevated. And you MUST save room for dessert...We were lucky enough to be invited to the soft opening. Now I can't wait to be here every Friday after work for snacks and cocktails!\", \"Was looking for somewhere new to try with my partner and I stumbled upon this gem!Service was warm and friendly, ambience was very sleek, and overall we were more than satisfied with all the dishes we got.Even though I loved everything we ate, I'll forsure be thinking about the filet mignon and coconut fudge cake long after this meal! We most certainly will be back and are so excited to try the other dishes this restaurant has to offer! Definitely a restaurant worth checking out!\", \"We were lucky enough to experience Memento SF opening week and it was very special. They have a great location with easy parking (which is not easy in the city).  I'll start off with the list of creative and delicious cocktails that they have are top notch, it was so difficult to decide which one to try first, my personal favorit Black Noir,  a smoky and unique drink , I wanted more. I had the Salmon Tartare and the Crispy curry chicken AMAZING and I was able to try more that were delicious. Overall it was an amazing experience, great restaurant , ambiance and service. Date night or dinner with friends this place is great.\", 'My partner and I happened upon this restaurant by chance and I am so glad we did! Walking in we immediately remarked on the aesthetic and how it was our kind of spot. We had cocktails and a small bite at the bar, and both left a big impression! Every member of staff that we interacted with were so attentive and kind, and made us feel as if we were old friends. Absolutely looking forward to our next visit!', \"Dinner @memento.sf was fantastic. The menu is eclectic which means something for everyone. For a small-ish space, the ambiance is lovely. The waitstaff is kind and attentive. Great service. I'm excited to return. 1. You Had Me at Hello #cocktail2. Za'atar flatbread which has a perfect flavor3. Salmon #tartare was plate licking my good.4. Heirloom tomato and arugula salad with a generous portion of avocado 5. Shared Lime Mousse dessert with a raspberry compote that was light and refreshing.\", \"It's all about the details...We really enjoyed our first dining experience at Momento SF. The service from the second we approached the door to the moment we walked out was impeccable.  It really felt like fine dining service within a neighborhood spot. The comfy space felt both fresh and intimate.  I'm a fan of a smaller unique menu filled with thoughtful dishes over a fluffed menu that tries to please the masses.  The amuse-bouche-like beverage arriving shortly after sitting down was great to sip while perusing the menu. The food was beautifully presented and delicious. Momento SF is a  much needed addition to the Noe Valley neighborhood.  We look forward to supporting this new business in the very near future.\", 'Delicious! The food has a unique flavor that all blends together beautifully. The presentation is spectacular. The cocktails are super different and comes with a fun twist with the garnishing and design. A lot of fun, you want to try all of them. The decor is stunning and I like the soft lighting. The beef tacos to start and the rigatoni was yummy and I am excited to try more. A nice place for a date, a celebration or just because. So glad this special restaurant is in the neighborhood.', 'Great food and ambiance. The staff is very attentive. The mignon was perfectly cooked and tasted amazing!', \"This was such a treat! I came here to celebrate my partner's birthday. Memento is somewhere where you can talk, eat, and enjoy the good ambiance. I was so immersed in conversation and the food that I didn't get a chance to snap a picture of the food or bar! :)The service was impeccable: they are extremely friendly and attentive here. I ordered the Portobello Mushroom Burger and it came with Truffle fries. The brioche bun was so tasty. And the fries were thin cut, delicious, and topped with a sprinkle of cheese. Would order again, because the burger was good but the fries blew my mind. What a great addition to Noe Valley.\", 'Awesome cocktails. Highly recommended. Ok I have to write something else because of the stupid yelp rule.', \"A small but inviting space to enjoy fine dining, great service and personal attention from the owner. Happy Noe Valley has another good restaurant. Only complaint: no decaf coffee but they'll have it soon\", 'So lovely, we initially booked for bar seating but they were able to accommodate us at a table (we are not picky at all but it was super sweet!) our server Dustin was amazing so friendly even though it was for sure busy for them. Cocktails and wine were delicious, we had the truffle fries and beet pasta- both were bomb. We are so excited to come back!', \"My husband & I finally got to try Memento SF and everything has exceeded our expectations! From the delicious mouth watering menu, the top-notch service, to the warm & cozy ambiance, the entire experience was perfected! We tried the mussels (and of course we paired it with the truffle fries!), the salmon tartare, and the filet mignon, and all were exceptional and delicious! And can we talk about the incredible cocktail menu please?! Each drink was meticulously garnished and presented with flair, turning your evening into a visual delight. I had berry me and my hubby had Holiday on the moon cocktail and both were perfectly balanced and delicious! For desserts, we tried the lime mousse and the caramel flan and both were to die for! We can't wait to go back and try more items on the menu. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or simply seeking an extraordinary dining experience, this hidden new gem is a must-visit destination in San Francisco.\", 'We sat at the bar.  Service and people were great.  Food was good with a variety of small plates and entrees.  Very unique and tasty cocktails.', 'LOVED my first Memento experience and will definitely be coming back again. Everything from the ambiance to the cocktails, starters, mains and desserts was exceptional. Salmon Tartar and truffle fries are a must, the beets rigatoni was delish (the added touch of ricotta on top is genius), and my oh my the coconut fudge pie!', 'Food is great, tasty, and fresh. The service is excellent and the staff is very nice. I defiently recommend!', \"It was a most enjoyable experience from start to finish. After we were greeted warmly, we sat and enjoyed a complimentary Memento shot which was delicious. I could've had a full cocktail size one of these but we were on a tight schedule. We started with a couple of appetizers, the truffle fries and zucchini fries and they were done to perfection. The best fries I've had in a long time!  We (three of us) had different main courses (beet pasta, portobello mushroom burger, and sous vide crispy chicken) and we all raved about our selections.   Because we had time constraints, we were going to forgo the dessert.  But because everything was so good, we had to try one. The lime mousse was epic!  We are so happy Memento is part of our Noe Valley restaurant scene. The only area that could use improvement was the limited wine selection. The wines offered weren't great (we had 3 different red wines) but were of course drinkable.  The restaurant had a mellow vibe playing nice music in the background. The service was attentive and friendly. It was a 5 star experience.\", 'Making a reservation was super quick and easy and both the food and service were AMAZING!', 'Met the owners, Suhair & Rafael, who told us a bit about their inspiration for the place, how they met in NYC, and some of the art they made personally on their walls. Only stopped by for some low-ABV cocktails, which honestly blew us away (Live-smoked cinamon with a blowtorch! Neat!) For a snack, they had fried zucchini sourced from their family nearby, and it made us happy to know how excited the owners\\' mom was to have folks enjoying veggies from her garden. Owners were more like kind hosts than \"proprietors\". Gonna take my mom here next!', \"Tried this restaurant in the first week that it opened and was so impressed! Everything was delicious -- particularly the salmon tartare and the mushroom burger. The drinks were especially creative and delicious. The service was so great and it was really fun how excited everyone was to be opening this restaurant. Just altogether a special and delicious experience. It's right away a new favorite!\"]\n",

      "Reviews: ['good food buenisima comida ya he ido varias veces se los recomiendo demasiado vayan y visitelos', \"Little Shucker is the shuckin' best! My husband and I came here for date night and we loved our experience.  The highlight for me was the oysters, raw and baked!  You could tell that the oysters were super fresh.  We had kumamotos, miyagis, and mere point oysters for our raw oysters, I believe. For the baked oysters, we tried the garlic butter (YUM), and the miso bone marrow (my personal fave!).  The spritz cocktails are really good too.  We tried the pink spritz and the lavender yuzu spritz (super refreshing).  I also liked that they had a natural wine on the menu. :)Little Shucker is perfect for date night or girls' night out!  The vibes and interior are super cute too.  Can't wait to come back.\", \"I've been on an oyster kick these days and Little Shucker was such a fantastic place to dabble. It's not cheap and you can quickly rack up a bill here, but it is surely worth the price you pay. Everything is so fresh and tasty. My friend and I came for lunch with a reservation but it wasn't too crowded. We got six Oysters, the Halibut Crudo, Smoked Salmon Tartine, and the Roasted Nori Cauliflower. The oysters were incredibly refreshing, and we love that we got to sample all three. I also loved the small plates we ordered. The cauliflower was so umami and had a nice bite to it, while the tartine was so hearty and creamy. Service was decent. Nothing to write home about but the atmosphere does make it worth the visit, as it's bright but homey.\", \"All the rave reviews are true - this place is a keeper! Perfect location and immaculate vibes, we loved everything about little shucker. We walked in at opening on a Saturday without a reservation and were seated immediately. The waitstaff was completely attentive and took our drink orders right away. One of our guests ordered a wine on tap, and within minutes was informed that they had to switch out the keg. She had to wait about ten minutes for her glass, and when it was brought to her, we were told it was on the house for her patience. She was offered alternatives but really wanted that wine, so despite her choosing to wait they still comped the glass - completely unnecessary but entirely grateful, we were won over immediately. Then the oysters came. In a city brimming with seafood options, this was the freshest of the fresh. We inhaled our dozen (with a variety from Tomales Bag and the east coast) just in time for the mussels to hit the table. When I tell you we were lapping up the garlic marinade, we were fighting over the last spoonful. For a seafood focused restaurant, their fries were also memorable, and the house hot sauce is  chef's kiss. Incredible experience all the way around - can't wait to come back to little shucker!\", \"Fresh seafood, cute interiors, $2 oyster happy hour, and good wine...how could you not have a good time at Little Shucker. This buzzy Pac Heights seafood spot from the team behind The Snug excels when it comes to simple, good seafood. I sampled a majority of the menu, and my favorite item was the Big Shucker, a classic chilled seafood tower that allows the quality to shine. If you love oyster shooters, you have to try their two creative takes - a sake tomato dashi with uni and a play on michelada with kimchi and pilsner. In addition to the tasty raw oyster selection, I also enjoyed the warm bone marrow baked oyster.For more substantial bites, I recommend the smoked salmon tartine with bright dill cream cheese on a fluffy pan de mie. The hot lobster roll was fine, but not as memorable. I would skip adding caviar to the roll, as it got lost with the strong flavors.My friend and I were comfortably full from the seafood feast, but we couldn't resist trying the pretty greek yogurt tart with seasonal stone fruit - a sweet, but restrained ending to a solid meal.I like that the smaller space, friendly staff, and menu lends itself to many occasions, whether it's a casual lunch, early happy hour, or romantic dinner date.\", \"The cutest spot on Fillmore! Perfect for a sunny day in SF. We ordered the Rockefeller oysters, miso bone marrow oysters, garlic butter oysters and I would recommend them all. We added caviar to the oysters and it was We also got the lobster roll which came with a generous amount of seafood, and the branzino. I would say I've had better branzino elsewhere and would stick to appetizers and drinks here! Great place for friends\", 'Came here for dinner on a weekend.Food: 4Decor: 4Service: 46 oysters, 22miyagi, kumamoto, and mere point~4/5. Fresh and cleaned properly.hot lobster roll, 35~4/5. Fresh lobster in a nice, hot, toasted bun. Pretty good, although I think New England Lobster Co. in Burlingame is slightly better.Service was nice and friendly.', \"Ambiance- decor was really nice and clean, bathrooms were well maintained and the table tops were tidyService- a little awkward and choppy but nice people, but incredibly slow for certain food items Food- some things were delicious and other things needed more attention*Big shucker- presentation was pretty, I think that the oysters were shucked fine, a little shelly but no real complaints. We sat at the bar so we watched them prepare the tower in front of us. The shrimp was really dry and didn't taste fresh at all, however the mussels were our favorite part! The Maine lobster was fine,nothing extraordinary and the geoduck was also okay. *lobster roll- I can't believe they charge 2$ for the chips when the roll is already 35$ I think that's absurd. It was also a small portion and lacked a sauce (butter isn't a sauce) **smoked trout salad- it reminded me of a deconstructed lox bagel in a good way. I wish the portion size was larger or if the plate had more lettuce ** we received our big shucker first at 2:15 and quickly finished the tower in about 10-15 mins because there wasn't a whole lot to it and we were super hungry. But we weren't served our salad and roll until 2:45 which we thought was a super long time to wait between plates. Especially because it wasn't particularly busy and the components of our plates were already made eg: the lobster was precooked and the trout was smoked so assembling the items on a plate shouldn't have taken too long (time stamps attached).  Price- not good, I hadn't realized or noticed that there was a 20% automatic service charge which I think is quite high (for this particular place). We were a group of four but they were kind and they split the bill into two for us because they noticed each couple shared items. I think 17-18% service charge is more realistic. Especially because we had really slow service between our plates.\", \"I have been craving baked oysters lately and it's actually quite hard to find.   Little Shucker appeared on my search and they had a reservation opened so we gave them a try. The ambience is so cute, it's so bright and welcoming, it reminds me being inside sometimes home in some coastal town.  They tend to get busy around 6pm, so I recommend making reservations. They have a happy hour menu too, and if you want that deal you have to come before 5 pm.  For Happy Hour they have raw oysters for 12 or 24 dollars depending if you get half a dozen or a dozen.  And of course, with happy hour there's wine or beer.  For our starters we did get the dozen oysters for $24.00 along with the crudo.  The fresh oysters were good and plump.  They gave you three sauces to pair with, the green sauce was the best. The crudo was paired with their avocado mousse and tomatoes which was so tasty!  I wish they gave us more of that mousse.   We also go the baked oysters which included the rockefeller, garlic butter, and miso bone marrow.  All of these were good, but i think my favorite was the Garlic Butter, followed by the Miso Bone Marrow and then the Rockefeller.   The miso bone marrow said it had cilantro but i couldn't taste it, which was good because i'm not a cilantro fan. The Lobster roll was delicious as you can taste how buttery the bread as and how sweet and juicy the lobster was.  It does get very messy to eat but it's worth the messiness. I hope they can expand their menu soon like their sister restaurant The Snug. I would love to come back and we can tell their staff is a great team as i see them working so well together.\", \"This is a great date night or outing spot in SF. I would 100% return for the baked oysters, especially the miso bone marrow. The service was incredibly attentive and we felt the dishes were fresh & delicious. The ambiance was nice, ample spacing around the tables, lighter color palette of the restaurant makes it feel larger, and it wasn't overly loud. 10/10\", 'Summary:Casual seafood cafe offering a small variety of tasty bitesDetails:Little Shucker reminds me a bit of the seafood spots you\\'d find up in the PNW, with their casual, but creative take on various seafood dishes, albeit with a more limited offering. That\\'s not to say you can\\'t get full here if you order enough of the right dishes, but it definitely has more of a \"come here and chill with some drinks and light bites\" vibe than a \"come stuff your face and belly\" one.Everything we had was pretty tasty, but the standouts included their garlic butter baked oysters (the miso bone marrow was just a tad too salty), halibut crudo, and hot lobster rolls (which is prepared differently than their cold), all of which came with very fresh ingredients, and some tasty, yet bright flavors. And honestly, the nori cauliflower was pretty tasty too, but it felt to us like it was mostly just a bunch of tasty banchan dumped on top of roasted cauliflower lol, so the value wasn\\'t quite there on that dish.Worth a stop by, but probably more as the precursor or successor to a nearby meal.Accessibility:Can\\'t speak for the interior, but plenty of accessible outdoor seating!', 'My friend brought me here for lunch for a belated birthday. This place is spectacular! All the staff was attentive, friendly, and accommodating, which made the experience so fantastic. I will be returning in the future. Shout out to everyone for such a good experience. The crudo, fried oysters, and the wine options were delightful.', \"We dined here for lunch. Our group comprised of five adults and two babies. The service couldn't have been friendlier and attentive; especially with our babies joining in on the meal. We ordered oyster shooter lights, the chips and dip, the bread, oysters in the half shell, and the crudo. We happened to be there for happy hour, so that was a pleasant surprise. The shooters were inventive and fun. Everything was presented nicely and most importantly, it was fresh!\", \"My recent visit to little shucker in Pacific Heights had its ups and downs. While the lobster roll was meaty, it was on the pricier side and, unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations - it turned out to be rather average.On a more positive note, the Caesar salad was decent and made for a suitable companion to the lobster roll.If you're on the hunt for a great lobster roll, I'd recommend waiting for Broadstreet Oyster to open up in Ghirardelli Square or stop by New England Lobster Company when you are near SFO. The service at little shucker was good, but for a memorable lobster roll experience, it seems I might have to venture elsewhere next time.\", 'Little shucker is has the cutest vibes! My partner and I love oysters so decided to give this spot a try. We got 6 oysters (2 of each type they had), the halibut crudo, mussels, and hot lobster roll. The oysters were super fresh! They give a lemongrass mignonette and two hot sauces with it. The olive oil on the crudo seemed really high quality and had such a good flavor, but honestly I thought it overpowered the halibut a little bit. The mussels were fire. The broth they were in was so delicious, and the portion was pretty big! Id say maybe around 20 mussels or so? I got fries with the mussels too, and they were super crisp and still fluffy in the middle. My partner got the lobster roll, which was good although I think the bread was a bit too buttery for me.', \"Oysters? YES! YES! YES! This new space (in the old Grove location) on Fillmore is just what the city has needed. A simple menu for indulging in fresh seafood, alongside a beautiful wine selection and bar. The restaurant is open and airy with fresh bright colors that just invoke a clean feel. Most oyster and seafood restaurants have a distinctly fishy smell, but not here, no no. We kept it simple with a couple dozen raw oysters, a couple of orders of baked oysters (who doesn't love Oysters Rockefeller?) and the Chips and Dip with the Caviar addition. I had a few Lavender Spritz that were refreshing and light. -Plenty of counter seats to watch the shuckers do their thing or table seating both indoor and outdoor-Unisex restroom -Reservations HIGHLY recommended to insure you get a seat -Service was quick and attentive JUST TREAT YOURSELF & get here if you love Oysters!\", \"Yayyyy new oyster spot in town :-) My friend booked a dinner reservation for the 4 of us-- AMAZING OYSTERS. To my understanding, they have a rotation, featuring some from Hog Island. Very cool & hip addition to an already quite upscale area.THE BIG SHUCKER: Perfect to split with a group of 4~ All extremely fresh & high quality. NEED to try their house-made green sauce-- it's fantastic.- SMOKED SALMON TARTINE: First time trying tartine on pan de mie, soooo pillowy soft and delicious. Small portions of salmon.- ROASTED NORI CAULIFLOWER: Hearty & umami-- even when shared, the small bowl is surprisingly filling- LOBSTER ROLL (hot): Ngl this is ok. $35 is high for a lobster roll... Tasty, but nothing insane.Only tried the seafood as we had 2 pescatarians in tow-- will need to come back to try the bone marrow another time.\", 'This place really did live up to the hype! So glad we came. What a lovely weekend brunch. I rarely give out 5 stars but this place was very deserving. My sisters and I had been dying to visit this place after it showed up all over instagram and had such great reviews. We came yesterday at noon. It was pretty quiet tbh - their dinner reservations are much harder to get!We ordered a ton of delicious food -- the big shucker, which was great, everything was fresh and amazing -- the salmon tartine, also amazing, and I got the lavender spritz and the lobster roll (warm with butter vs. cold) and added caviar. The spritz was almost too pretty to drink but man was it good! And the lobster roll was absolutely amazing. Maybe just a tad too much butter, but all in all so good. And they give you so much caviar as well! Not cheap but definitely really good and the service was phenomenal as well.', 'Came for happy hour on a Thursday around 4:30pm with a friend. Most tables and seats were full but the hostess found us a spot in their stand room area. Drinks: NA spritze - was good, sweet with a hint of bitterness wish this had a little more acidity to balance the sweetness but still enjoyable Food: Raw Oysters - fresh small to medium sized oysters with a slight salinity, served with lemon wedges, mignonette and hot sauce, there was a bit of shell and grit in some of the oysters Baked miso bone marrow oysters - really tasty, larger in size, creamy and rich with some fattiness from the bone marrow and savory umami from the miso Service was fine, pretty busy during happy hour but  servers came by regularly to check in. The hostess brought out water when we were first seated. Overall a decent spot for oyster happy hour. You can only order oysters and drinks in the bars standing area so if you want a full meal definitely grab a reservation.', \"Definitely recommend this cute little restaurant to satisfy your seafood cravings. Yesssss--it's not the cheapest, but with inflation and all, prices are on par with all the other seafood forward restaurants in the Bay Area.For appetizers, We ordered their baked oysters--which were to die for. We loved how savory the sauces were; it complimented the juicy oysters perfectly. We chose two out of the 3 flavors, rockerfeller and the miso one.  For our mains, my hubs ordered their signature lobster roll and I got the Caesar salad. Both dishes  were executed well. My salad was hardy and full of umami (extra points for having actual anchovies in it).  The guns loved his lobster roll which had well flavored lobster nestled inside a perfectly toasted soft bun. There are two versions--hot and cold, we opted for the hot. We finished off the meal with a side of Fries (yum) and some drinks. They have adorable and delicious tasting spritzers. Overall, great experience and ambiance. Pricey food--but cute drinks.\", \"Little Shucker is where The Grove used to be on Fillmore and they've really done a great job renovating the space.  My friend and I ordered the chips with dip to share.  The dip is sour cream, chives, and fried shallots.  It's simple, but delicious!  For myself, I got the baked garlic butter oysters, the roasted nori cauliflower, Cesar, salad, and a nonalcoholic wine spritzer.  That was the perfect lunch!  The baked oysters were cooked so perfectly!  The the oysters were so plump and juicy.  I really like the addition of the bread crumbs on top. I also got one oyster with caviar for an additional five dollars.  It was a good serving of caviar too.  And it wasn't over the top - I thought it enhanced the flavors of the big oyster really well.  But they're also good on their own so if you're not a caviar fan you're not missing out.  But I suggest you treat yourself because you deserve it and get that caviar.The roasted nori cauliflower was also really good. It had a good char and smokiness which balance well with the overall acidity of the dish.  The Caesar salad was pretty big and my friend and I probably could've shared it. I've never had anchovies with my Caesar salad. I know that they're usually in the dressing but the salad has literal anchovy meat in it. I thought it was good because it added a saltiness to the salad. I am so glad that they have a few nonalcoholic options because I currently cannot drink alcohol at the moment.  My white wine spritzer was delicious and not too sweet. This place is really popular, so I recommend getting reservations.  My friends and I tried going on a Friday night during the week of Burning Man since the city is usually empty during that time.  Though their website says they save tables for walk-ins, that was unfortunately not the case that night as they were fully booked.  So I recommend getting reservations if you plan on dining here.\", \"Stumbled upon this gem on a visit to SF about 1.5 weeks after their official opening. Great decision! My husband and I arrived at 11:30am. It wasn't crowded yet but we opted to sit at the bar which was super fun. Sophie took care of us splendidly. She was so attentive and friendly even when the lunch crowd filled the place up. Really great vibes all around.We had rosé on tap and started with a sampling of raw oysters. The oysters were so fresh and all delicious with a top-notch mignonette. I usually prefer west coast oysters (though I'm an East Coast gal) but the Steubens from Maine were our favorite of the round. We also tried the miso bone marrow baked oysters which were AMAZING and unlike any baked oysters I've ever had. He had the smoked trout salad and declared it his ideal most perfect salad so that was a big win. I had the warm lobster roll with maui onion chips and devoured every bite. Maaaaybe I've had a better lobster roll in my life but outside New England this one was definitely up there. A+ all around. Highly recommend. (In fact, I did recommend it to family we were staying with; they went for dinner later the same day and said they also loved their meal.)\", \"I loved everything about this restaurant!! The moment I arrived at night, it was giving me that West Anderson movie vibe! Everything was so vibrant in color and you literally cannot miss this restaurant on the street of Fillmore, it makes you feel like you are in a hollywood movie.Our server was extremely attentive and took the time to explain every single dish in detail which makes me feel very heartwarming because I could hear the passion from him as he describes the ingredients. I came here after failing an exam so I decided to eat until my heart is content and what is better than trying ALL of their oysters. My favorites are still the Kumamoto and Miyagi but omg their baked oysters are just as bomb. That miso bone marrow and rocket fellew were literally flavor bomb dropped in your mouth with the oilyness with the balance of ocean oyster! The lobster roll was also really good, especially the bread, I mean carb is lifeee. I guess the only thing that was least impressive to me was the roasted nori cauliflower, it was just a bit bland without anything unique about it. Overall, this place is a must if you are an oyster lover and just wanted to enjoy a good night out and pretend you are living in a Hollywood movie or just come and eat after failing an exam like I did hahaOh I forgot to mention, get that Greek yogurt tart, you will not disappoint. It's big enough to be shared by 2-3 people!!\", \"Little shucker was a cute restaurant that recently opened and to my understand women owned, so we went out to celebrate one of our girlfriend's birthday. We were seated promptly, water came quickly and server was attentive throughout the night. We got a dozen of oysters, oyster shooter, crudo, chip and dip, and musses as a main. Everything was fresh and pretty tasty. I though the crudo was a tad salty; but my friends said theirs were fineS maybe it was my area that had an extra dash of salt of some sort. They have outdoor seating which i would recommend, as it was a but loud inside for me. Total was approximately $65-70/person. Would recommend for a date night or girls night out.\", \"Miso.

F O O D* Raw Oysters: Miyagi + Kumamoto (1/2 dozen - $22): https://tinyurl.com/32p4v4sdBoth oysters were fresh, briny, and properly shucked/inspected (no shell fragments). It was served with a nước chấm mignonette that gave it some punch and funk without overpowering the oysters. We ended up ordering another half dozen so yes, they were that good!Make sure to try their housemade hot sauces (red and green). Their green hot sauce (serrano peppers) was great - packed heat while adding a citrusy tang. * Baked Oysters (2 pc - $10 x3)--Rockefeller w/ spinach, pancetta, grana padono: https://tinyurl.com/4dxy8md6Fav of the three, rich and creamy but you can still taste the sweet brininess and silky texture of the oyster.--Garlic Butter w/ chive oil, garlic beurre blanc: https://tinyurl.com/bdfssbr7Just the right amount of savory garlicky-chive flavor to complement the oyster. --Miso Bone Marrow w/ pickled daikon, cilantro: https://tinyurl.com/bdfssbr7Sounded great on paper but it was my least fav of the three. While the bone marrow added a luxe richness, the miso's saltiness was overpowering. It was in no way bad tho...we just preferred the other two baked preps.* Local Halibut Crudo w/ avocado mousse, gooseberry, radish ($16): https://tinyurl.com/4524zj4fLOVED THIS! The pristine cuts of halibut melted like buttah in our mouffs with the gooseberry adding a subtle sweet fruity bite. Perfect example of sourcing and showcasing top-notch ingredients with thoughtfulness and care.* Smoked Salmon Tartine w/ milk bread, dill cream cheese, caper jam ($14): https://tinyurl.com/5222svt7Another winner...pillowy soft milk bread topped with a creamy layer of dill cream cheese, silky sheets of smoked salmon, and lemony tang from the caper jam. Not overly salty. SO good. S E R V I C EFor second day of dinner service, service was very impressive and customer oriented. The staff esp our server, Paul was hitting ALL cylinders - introduced himself, reviewed the menu, asked about food allergies, brought a pour of wine without asking, promptly cleared empty plates, offered fresh plates/utensils between courses, and offered my dog water. Courses were well-paced and presented. We were in/out in an hour (early dinner). A M B I A N C EGreat transformation from The Grove's dark cabin vibes  - it's now hip and bright with a cute seafood counter and bar area. The sidewalk seating (6 tables) is great for people and dog watching. There's overhead heaters but still bring a warm coat if you're dining outside. P A R K I N GVery challenging street parking. Give yourself an extra 15-20 minutes if you're meeting up friends/fam. Overall, excellent seafood resto with 5 star service. It's been a while since I've been to a new resto where they're operating like a well-oiled machine. So, it's no surprise that Little Shucker is the new hot spot in Pac Heights. If you're on the SEEfood diet, they're def worth hitting up!\", \"TLDR Little Shucker was such a fun dining experience. I came with a group of girlfriends and the restaurant is so cute. Has a casual feel that's perfect for oysters with the girlies or a date night. They have created a very trendy but inviting atmosphere. Service is friendly. Food is fresh and delicious. Will definitely return. They also have oyster happy hour Wednesday and Thursday from 3-5. Service was very friendly and attentive. We ordered the Petillant Blanc Avinyó wine, which our server told us is their Spanish Party Wine. Needless to say we were sold. They also coursed out our food and we didn't feel rushed. For the food. Of course we had to get oysters! We tried all three types on the menu. My favorites were the Kumamoto from Tomales Bay. They were sweet and a little briny and so delicious. The oysters are served with a mignonette and two housemate hot sauces. We also loved the baked garlic butter oysters. Other menu highlights smoked salmon tartine with caper jam and a big bowl of mussels in white wine jus with fries. Chips and dip were a fun add but I wouldn't order again. I would also skip the crudo next time I go. Cons, it is very very loud. This restaurant is better for solo dining and groups of 2-4. Above that is incredibly hard to hear at the table.\", \"Very cute spot! During the heat wave we stopped by for some drinks and small bites to cool down. We didn't have a reservation but were seated immediately. The bone marrow baked oysters were divine. We also enjoyed the mussels, fries and cauliflower. The lavender yuzu and vermouth hi ball spritzes were refreshing. The space is bright and cheery. Service was friendly and quick. I saw that they have happy hour on Wednesday and Thursday from 3-5pm and look forward to trying that next!\", \"What an awesome new spot on Fillmore! If we still lived down the street, I would come weekly. We were able to pop in for lunch Saturday and really enjoyed our meal. Great service, bright & beautiful space, and food was yummy. Loved both salads, the garlic oysters (miso ones didn't taste like bone marrow only miso), mussels, and lobster roll. Everything on the menu was right up my alley. Perfect place for lunch on a sunny day with a spritz.\", \"The last place I went similar to this was the new popi's oysterette in marina ..this little shucker has lobster rolls and we all know that I'm an expert lobster roll taster..so this one has to be mastered because the menu is minimal ..serves the seafood platter like $98 and small plates oysters mussels and the lobster roll ..unveiled with roe and crispies and nice buttery roll. ..it's pricey at $33 and thats like two rolls to me and its small....i want a bigger lobster roll and like ten dollars off because they all end up tasting the same ..this is woodhouse fish co competitor ..nice interior..light and california style seafood ..u know i would eat a lobster roll everyday ...in maine..this little piggy wants more seafood20% surcharge is a ripoff for me..the bill for a roll and coke was $50..rip off prices.\", 'We visited LS during their first week of operations where only lunch service is offered. Dinner service will be available next week, after 8/9. Lots of excitement & anticipation after reading about LS in SF Standard. The LS team did a great job transforming the former Grove space that featured lots of dark wood panels, into a beautiful, sun bathed dining room.We started off with cocktails (I had the lavender spritz which was so light & refreshing that I ordered a second one). My friend had the white wine spritz which she enjoyed a lot. We shared a dozen oysters of all 3 varieties, which were super fresh & tasty. Our favorite was the miso bone marrow baked oysters. A unique combination of flavors that worked in harmony. The smoked trout salad was flavorful & not too smoky or salty & the buttermilk dressing was the perfect combination to the texture of the frisée salad. The local halibut crudo was delicate with mild flavors. The roasted nori cauliflower was a nice, flavorful & healthy dish.Service was excellent - warm, friendly & helpful. I will definitely be back soon!', \"really cool new spot in pacific heights on fillmore - definitely has a nice ambiance w big windows, lots of outdoor seating, and warm lighting. made a reservation here about a week in advance, can be difficult to get one at a reasonable time so had to monitor notifications for a while.we ordered the lobster roll, garlic baked oysters, kumamoto oysters, and the mussels. of all of them, would say the mussels had the best value for taste - came with ~15-20 mussels and the sauce was delicious.the lobster roll was also amazing, but for the price, i can't say it's entirely worth it. it's pretty small and likely isn't enough for a full meal.overall, glad i got to try it out and the food was great - however, ended up being about ~$70pp which feels like too much for the amount you get. would advise coming during happy hour to get the best value!!\", \"Can I just say.. wow. Took me right back to Lisbon! The atmosphere here as well has a very sleek/modern European seafood restaurant vibe (if you've been to Portugal or Spain, you'll appreciate this reference)! The service was spectacular, I could not have felt more at home from the hostess at the door - to the servers at the bar, all the way to the food runners. They're a fun, lively group that have great chemistry and work well together! Exceptionally kind people. Hats off to whoever is doing the hiring!Okay.. now for the food. From the raw bar, I ordered the Kumamoto, garlic butter with caviar and miso bone marrow baked oysters. The Kumamoto were amazing, very light brininess and a little fruity and sweet. Perfect for anyone that's unsure what to order, these are a great start. I then worked my way to the garlic butter baked oysters with caviar and OH MY GOODNESS, I will be coming back specifically for them but next time I will be getting myself a dozen. I can not recommend these enough. The miso bone marrow was recommended by my sweet waitress so I gave them a shot. I would say they are on the salty side (miso, obviously) but I'm glad I tried them but would probably stick to the Rockefeller or garlic ones next time. On the small plate, I ordered the salmon tartine! It was really good, very fulfilling and a good size to share with another person! I paired everything with a glass of petillant blanc, because like I mentioned.. this place just takes you back to the coast of Spain and why not pull the whole experience together with cold glass of Spanish wine! Perfect pairing if you ask me. Enjoyed my dining experience here. You will love this place!!\", 'Charming ambiance, delicious flavors, fresh seafood. Favorites were baked oyster miso bone marrow, lobster roll, and mussels.  Branzino was great as well.', \"Very cute place to eat! Small restaurant on Fillmore street. Loved the oysters and their special sauces (especially the green sauce!) but my favorite thing on the menu was the specialty baked scallops (not sure what they put in there but its SO GOOD)! The lobster roll was up to standards. Only thing was that all the portions were very small and there's not that many choices on the menu (I wish they had more mains to choose from)! Loved the service too!\", \"What a cool spot!  My friend took me here for my birthday and it's super fabulous.  We shared two dozen oysters, two bottles of sparkling wine, a salad, two apps and a dessert.  Kinda pricy but so worth the money.  The ingredients are super good quality.  The service beyond awesome; Dylan and Zola were so friendly and attentive.  The ambiance screams low key but fab!  I would definitely come back again. Side note: didn't see much parking but it's the city; just walk or uber.\", \"This is a very lively spot, came here to eat after a 7mile walk around the Golden Gate Park.  Got to sit right in front of the Oyster lady (bar area) busy shucking away she works hard!!!.  Ordered the 12 oysters and tried them all. The Marin Miyagi and Kumamoto were the best ones.  First time having the petit maman and I never knew fresh oysters can be creamy like that it was different and good but I prefer the others. The smoked trout salad was refreshing. I enjoyed the Caviar service though it was slightly different than others I've tried.  Bone marrow miso baked oysters were a hit. I'd say a great place to have light and small bites but recommend making a resy, this place gets busy!\", \"Have been looking forward to this place opening, and it's so cute! Good amount of seating inside and nice outdoor seating as well. Perfect for a date or an afternoon catch up. We just stopped by for some oysters and spritz's/ wine at about 2pm on a Sunday and we're seated outside right away. the spritz's are so beautifully done- my friend got the lavender yuzu ($13) which came out a beautiful purple- said it was good. Also got a white wine which was the perfect pairing for the 2 dozen oysters ($39/dozen) we got. Oysters were very fresh and mignotte was good. Service was very friendly and quick. Definitely a bit on the pricier side, but would love to try some of their other food and dessert (chocolate budino!).\", 'Was very excited to come here today - made a reservation for 5:30pm on Resy but had to push back, thankfully they were able to accommodate (requested the change via Email). Got seated promptly and service was lovely and all the servers were very friendly and attentive.For the ambiance, the inside of the restaurant does not inspire as much joy as the branding and vibe suggests - I was seated facing the wall (not a cute view) and gave my bf the booth so he could see a cute view of the place behind me. I liked the rounded edges and corners on the tables and the interior was very clean and minimalist and simple, maybe so the food on the blue plates and colorful drinks could pop?We got some drinks (lavender yuzu and pink spritz) and both were great. I love when places have clear ice, it just shows that slight attention to detail. For the main event - the food - I was excited by the menu and wanted to try everything but had to pare it down since I wasn\\'t super hungry. I got one of each oyster (delicious, so fresh) and the baked miso bone marrow oysters. Do not pass on these baked oysters they are SO good and creamy and warm. The flavors were amazing and all very compatible. The lobster roll was also good (I wish they had a crab roll) and the bread was nice and buttery but nothing to write home about so at $35 I probably wouldn\\'t get it again. I thought the roasted cauliflower was delicious with a subtle toasty briny flavor but for my bf it was too subtle. My boyfriend isn\\'t a raw seafood person so he got the Caesar with chicken and unfortunately the chicken was extremely dry. I know I know why would you order chicken at a seafood restaurant? But still if it\\'s going to be offered at least deliver on it! Overall I give it a 4/5 - fun menu items and drinks but slightly lacking in ambiance. But don\\'t get me wrong I\\'ll definitely be back for more oysters and to try more of the rest of the menu! And I appreciate that the 20% of subtotal is included as a service fee and they don\\'t have anywhere for an \"optional, additional\" tip on top that still makes the consumer feel awkward if they skip it.', \"My wife & I put our name down for about a 30 minute wait to be seated on a Saturday afternoon! Wait time was unsurprising given how busy Littler Shucker always looks.We ordered a glass of wine and Spritz - no complaints here.For food, we ordered 12 oysters to share, along with the roasted cauliflower and halibut crudo. Highly recommend trying all 3; The Cauliflower was our favorite, it was roasted perfectly and the flavor was great. Next time, I definitely want to come back and try the mussels and lobster roll.Service was great, and interior decor was on point. I concur with a lot of the other reviews posted for Little Shucker, it's certainly worth the hype and experience.\", 'This oyster bar is a gem in the Fillmore district. Delicious oysters with a classic mignonette, including $2 happy hour oysters (miyagi from tamales bay) from 3-5pm on wed and thurs. Try them with a hit of the tasty green hot sauce. Little shucker also has 2 outstanding oyster shooter which I highly recommend. The menu is otherwise simple but both the lobster roll and the mussels were fantastic renditions of the classic dishes.']\n",

      "Reviews: ['This place was an ideal choice for an outdoor gathering with friends after a long week. The ordering process involved using a QR code and presenting your ID at the host stand (which initially struck me as odd, but the waiter proceeded to check IDs anyway). This system made it convenient for everyone to settle their bills individually in a group setting.I would rate it 4 out of 5, mainly because it was on the expensive side, but the food and drinks truly hit the mark. The pork buns, in particular, were a delightful surprise, offering a pleasing combination of sweet and spicy flavors with the addition of shaved jalapeños and marinated fatty pork. The tater tots were delicious, especially when paired with alternating dips of ketchup and yuzu mayo. While the Paloma slush was enjoyable, I plan to try the popular prickly pear next time.', \"Came here for a friends birthday on the weekend night and was seating at one of the larger tables. It seems the upstairs section was not open for the night, and it was packed. However, even though it was packed, we received subpar service. My friend who is a regular there was a bit surprised at the lack of timely service. I didn't think the staff was overwhelmed, with some of them seeing to take a lax approach to the night when I personally would have thought they would be checking in on tables or checking for patrons that were looking for a server to place order and waiting minutes.I got one of their coffee espressos (the name might be off), but its was delicious and worth the expectations that my friend had set.I enjoyed my time here and probably would come back!\", '3.5 rounded to 4 stars. Nice location, pretty great ambiance. You could order your drinks by scanning the QR code, we had a hard time finding the code because it was pretty small and taped to the side of the table. We had the Chamomile gin and Coconut daiquiri, both were pretty meh in my opinion. I was expecting the drinks to have more depth of flavor but they just straight up tasted bitter. I think the Chamomile gin was a bit lighter and had more flavor. In addition, each drink came up to $18 including tax and the gratitude fee which was on a more pricey side.', \"I definitely kept it snug at The Snug! It's up to par with other cocktail bars in the area but I do feel like they have their own hits and misses.My companion took me here after I got off work. The spot is spacious and clean with seating at the bar and tables in one area. Or a communal table and window seating on the other side. They also have plenty of outdoor seating. We chose to sit by the windows which beckoned natural light and a place to people watch. My main gripe is the 20% automated tip considering there is zero service from start to finish. You sit down, order and pay using their QR code, and receive your food and drinks from a runner--no interactions whatsoever which is sucky.Their QR code leads you to their lunch, dinner, and libations menu. Its comfort American and California fare is on the pricier end. Plus uniquely crafted cocktails. I enjoyed my drink and the Tots my companion and I shared--super crispy, not soggy, and good quality. We got Ketchup and Yuzu Mayo on the side. The Yuzu Mayo was phenomenally creamy and you could clearly taste the citrusy flavor. One more is they charge for their sauces so it does get costly!This is a solid option for a drink and bites for those in the Pac Heights or the surrounding area. Parking is on the street off Fillmore or surrounding areas. Ideal for pairs or small and large groups as it's inviting and roomy. Personally, I won't become a regular as the food and drinks are overpriced considering there's no service and a mandatory surcharge, but I'll come back on special occasions!\", 'Came for post dinner drinks And will 100% come here againVery well executed drinksGreat breadth of speciality cocktails Cute ambiancePlenty of seating - inside and out Attentive waitstaff', \"I love coming here to grab drinks with friends during the week. The prickly pear is my favorite cocktail here. The Snug also has solid bar food so we'll usually order a few things to share (tots, popcorn chicken, fried chicken sandwich, and brussel sprouts are some of our typical suspects) Great spot on Fillmore!\", \"First time here! Got the aloe vera mocktail and crispy zucchini. The mocktail was really good and I love the glassware it came in. The crispy zucchini was okay. I'm not sure how much I like the dipping sauce though but the zucchini itself was well seasoned. Love that they expanded their parklet and that you can pay your tab individually by QR code (or keep your tab open and add more things). Each table in the parklet as its own heater though not sure how hot it gets as it is high up. Service was really quick and they continuously cleared our empty glasses and tableware. Tip is already automatically added when you ordered so no need to leave a tip on the table or pay it separately.\", 'Fried Chicken Sandwich is the reason I go here. Along with the fantastic cocktails. I trust the ingredients and the cocktails can be with or without alcohol.', \"We came here on Friday night for some drinks and dinner and were seated right away. FYI you order on QR code stuck on the table and keep an online tab that way.  A 20% gratuity fee is automatically added instead of tipping and the hostess also lets you know before you sit down. My friend got their Prickly Pear cocktail and I got their Margarita. She got a burger and we split some of their tater tots. The food is nothing super unique but it tastes really good. I think they are more known for their drinks. The prickly pear cocktail doesn't really have any taste to it other than the mezcal and the spice. It was hard to tell if the burn was coming from the spice of the jalepeno or if it was the alcohol in the drink. The margarita however, was pretty solid - it tasted perfectly tart from the lime and very refreshing. Overall it's a great place to come and have drinks with a friend.\", \"What a perfect spot to dine outside with friends after a long week! You QR code to order and show your ID at the host stand (which I thought was odd but as the waiter then proceeded to check anyways) so it's easy to pay for your own items as a group. Ranked a 4/5 because it was very pricey but the food and drinks overall hit the spot. The pork buns were surprisingly flavorful and packed a nice sweet and spicy punch with the shaved jalapeños and marinated fatty pork. The tater tots were delicious especially when alternating between ketchup and yuzu mayo. The Paloma slush was solid but will definitely try the prickly pear nest them as it seems to be a popular drink!\", 'What a cool place to hang out and have a bite and a cocktail. Great atmosphere and wonderful service.', \"The food was good,  we had the Hummus, which was really good! The burger was on point as well.  They only had a couple of beers on tap but Pliny the Elder made up for it. The  music playlist was nice, 90's vibe. Overall was a nice place for a quick bite or to hang out.\", \"This place gave off pretentious but damn did they really change my mind! The food is a bit pricey but the quality of the ingredients and put together was worth it. I got the pork belly buns and they melted in my mouth, cousin for wagyu burger and she went to heaven! My mom got the chicken salad and said it was the best salad she had had in years! The drinks were my ONE gripe. The cool rectangular prism looks awesome in the glass but you take it out and discover their is only actually a quarter cup of drink in their. So disappointed so I bring myself to in a very salty attitude take the glass to try it and it was SO GOOD. UGH haha! The spa water was very refreshing and perfect mixed and it instantly made me annoyed I couldn't continue being salty haha! Great spot! Will be back for pork belly buns and spa water!\", \"I've been to the snug about three times now and it has been a solid place. They have a self-serve QR code ordering system which you order from and the food is brought directly to the table where you scanned your code at which I thought was very cool there is a 20% automatic gratuity tacked on at the end of your bill which hikes up the prices and was a bit much for me and the single burger and popcorn chicken we got. The wagyu burger though, is pretty solid! The star of the show was the dijonaise and carmelized onions, absolutely delicious.  I'd come again but only for a special occasion.\", \"Great drinks! You order and pay by scanning a QR code. Only thing the service is limited but is there's a 20% service fee instead of gratuity\", 'If you want a laid back chill type bar to go hangout with some friends this is the place to check out.

By no means the best fried chicken sandwich ever, but had good flavor - Squash Tempura: this was really delicious - would recommend ordering this.- Popcorn chicken: always a good hit, especially with the yuzu MayoMiscellaneous:- Indoor dining and outdoor parklet dining available- Typical SF availability for parking - Love that you can have your own tab from the QR code if you want (makes paying the bill easier at the end)', 'Most of the items are very pricey but taste was superB.

Seriously, my mouth is watering just thinking bout them.Not sure how I feel about the \\'fair wage surcharge in lieu of tipping\\' - maybe they should be getting a fair wage to begin with? I know, such a radical concept right', 'Came here on a Friday night with some friends for some drinks and snacks. Good variety on the menu and really good service. We had the spa cocktail, shiitake hummus, brussel sprouts, and homemade pickles. The cozy atmosphere, warm outdoor seating, and efficient service add to the overall charm. Note that orders are placed on your phone with a QR code on the table, and auto 20% fair wage surcharge is included in the bill.', 'Great outdoor table setup- all in individual booths. I like coming here for drinks or for a relaxing lunch or happy hour. They have a wide drink selection- from non alcoholic favorites like Arnold Palmer, to sparking wine, draft beer and cocktails. I like their fall salad- which was really delicious and filling: yellow and red beets with arugula, goat cheese, in a light vinaigrette dressing.', \"I've been a fan of the Snug since it opened a few years ago.  I especially appreciate all the outdoor dining space and the mobile ordering system.  The service is always friendly, and the drinks and food are delivered quickly and efficiently.  On my recent self-care day, I was walking up Fillmore and decided to stop by for a bite.  I got the Impossible burger vegan style (on a lettuce wrap) with a side of fries.  The burger was delicious and the fries hot, fresh, and crispy.  The Snug is a great addition to the Pac Heights neighborhood!  Check it out!\", \"We called ahead of time to double check if they allow dogs and they did (because they have parklets and that's where we stayed). Never got to see the inside but the aesthetics of the restaurant looks cute. We over ordered the sides so we had way too many potatoes but it's all good. I ordered the wagyu burger and I can't believe I was gonna  love it.\", \"Amazing fried chicken sandwich!! Decent cocktails - would not go out of my way for one, but happy to stop by when I'm in the area Nice seating options both inside and outside\", \"Came here on a Saturday night with no reservation with a party of 5. They sat us at table that we had to share with a different party which I didn't like but we had no other choice so it was fine. Food 3/5: We got the buns which were really dry and the popcorn chicken which didn't really have any flavor and I don't think the yuzu Mayo went well with the chicken. The Brussels were okay and the tots were good. Overall it's not bad for bar food.Service 2/5: We scanned the barcode and ordered so we didn't really get great service. Someone literally just brought us what we ordered and that's it. And they charge mandatory 20% tip for really doing nothing! So that's why I'm giving this place a 2...to automatically charge 20% when we sat ourselves and ordered ourselves is drastic.\", 'Saturday around 4pm rolled in to plenty of outdoor booths - heated, private little benches for your group. They band you after checking ID and everything is done online. From placing the order via phone to food & drinks coming out was super speedy and prompt. Was actually surprised at the speed. All of the drinks we tried were so yummy. The PB Milk Punch was a special hit for me - liquid peanut butter - YUM! Such a nice area to meet up and hang out with an awesome ambiance, food, and dranks.', \"Awesome parklet. Decent chicken sandwich. 20% tip on all orders... absolutely NO service though?? I'm so confused. Only one worker who didn't say a word, I ordered everything through my phone,  had to ask twice for water, no interaction whatsoever. Dining in here is no different than just ordering Togo. If the service was existent I would give at least 3 stars.\", \"First time I've ordered online for full service but was pleasantly surprised when as soon as we clicked order 3 waters were brought to our table and the food also came quickly and didn't disappoint.  Great tots. A better than most chicken sandwich and a salad that was delicious. Outside was wonderful and a large booth made us very comfortable.  Great place!\", \"Such a cute place to grab a drink, catch up with friends, or for a date night. I'm a sucker for the aesthetic and this place has it all. Cozy benches, floor to ceiling plants, large corner windows, modern lighting. I went there for a date around 7:30pm on Thursday. Even though it looked quite busy, we were seated immediately and given the option to sit at a bar-like seating near the windows, or at a table farther back in the bar. We opted for the window seating, which was honestly pretty fun to people watch on Fillmore st. It's loud inside, but not so loud that you can't hear the other person. Vibe note: we were surrounded by many many other couples in this corner. Guess everyone has the same idea?!The menu has a great selection, and I appreciated that there were actual food options versus just fries/chips. Ordering is done through QR code, a very smart idea. It made ordering drinks quick and easy. With so many people in the bar, I think it would've been a lot harder to flag down a waiter every time we wanted another drink. Would definitely go back again! Great drinks, friendly service, and a fun vibe.\", 'Lovely spot on Fillmore St for a weekend brunch and people-watching! The shiitake hummus with crunchy garlic (?) on top was great. Super fast service.Dined: July 23, 2022', 'We love the Snug! Great drinks, service and atmosphere. The menu is great but lately they have been missing some of our favorite items when we go. Sweet potato tacos being at the top of the list!', \"Great outdoor space in Filmore with heat lamps and contactless ordering and payment. It was perfect that I could scan the QR code to place my order, and the code is tied to the table I was sitting at so the servers knew where to bring out my food. It was also super helpful because I left my wallet at home, but know my credit card number so it made it very convenient. From ordering to delivery, the food was fairly quick. The portions are large. The one thing I would note is that the ambiance is casual, including service especially with their new set up. Personally, I don't mind, but some people may prefer more hands on service - if so, this likely isn't the spot for you. If you want good food, contactless service and payment, good casual vibes, then definitely check this place out.I had the wagyu burger and fries and thought it was tasty. The burger comes on a pretzel bun so it is different than traditional buns. Pretty good IMO, but they also have an impossible burger if you prefer vegan!\", \"This spot is incredible cool. I'd recommend this place for everyone who loves cocktails. They have an outstanding options of alcohol. Nitro Margarita and Paloma Slushy are my favourites. Atmosphere inside is so modern and comfortable. Location is super nice. I love Pacific. They also have large open windows, not crowded. Outside sitting is also super comfortableWe also had food there and it was amazing. Portions are huge. Try their popcorn chicken and wagyu smash cheeseburger. Bartender was nice and friendlAnd if you could have a chance to reserve. You'll not regret.\", \"The Snug is a cozy spot with a pleasant ambiance and tasty cocktails. The only challenge is finding a spot to sit (or even stand) on a Friday or Saturday night. It gets pretty busy during peak hours, so you may want to get here early if you want to find a spot at the bar or at a table. Parking is tough, given the Snug's location in the Fillmore District. You're better off taking a cab and then strolling down Fillmore to other locations nearby.

Good Taylor tots too. The ambiance is great with the outdoor seating - dog friendly too. The outdoor dining has heaters above the tables so you don't get too cold.

The location is also in a great neighborhood, Fillmore, with lots of shops and other places to eat and drink. The space is big and there's a few larger table that can seat 6 people so i would say it's good for groups. I ordered the double smash burger and I loved it. I also got the sesame naan shiitake hummus, I don't know if I'd order it again, it was only okay but I was excited to try it. I was also disappointed they didn't have any options for dessert.

No reservation and still sat us at a shared table. The menu is via a barcode you scan and order your food directly. No actual service other than someone bringing your food.We had the nitro margarita which was decent. They explicitly say that you can't modify (lol). We shared the mushroom hummus, Brussel sprouts, and pork buns. The mushroom hummus was delicious. The brussel sprouts were okay. And the pork buns were pretty dry but the flavor was good. Good food for a bar. Overall would def come back. However, not sure I'm a fan of the automatic 20% gratuity. Considering that there was no actual service...\"]\n",

Although the restaurant is smaller, they do have a long table that can accommodate larger group. I definitely recommending ordering a variety of plates because they are shareable.

Let's start with the med height guy with a curled mustache I think who greeted us, he was meh not too attentive but okay, sat us down in the corner booth table because I asked for that, sure wished he told me of another booth table in the back with more space as we are very tall people, nonetheless we were snug & comfy which was all that mattered! Then a young blond guy with a half ponytail bartender I believe came and took our drink order! My son mentions happily to him ... it's my parents 31st anniversary... and this guy just had this blank stare as if he were saying in his head ... AND? ... gave him our drink order and another guy took our appetizer order maybe the guy who sat us down? Can't remember! Throughout the night a very tall handsome server who we saw treat every guest with a huge smile and laughter and silently I wished he was our Server! Entree time we sort of got my wish cause he came and asked if we were ready to order and the one that sat us down pushed through and said not so nicely ... I GOT IT ... and we watched the Happy one walk away still smiling! He later came and asked if I wanted anything else and I asked for more wine and could not help but squeeze in there how I loved how he treated his guests and his smile! Didn't get his name but I do remember his face and will definitely ask to sit in his area!  That was that! We loved the ambiance and if all the servers were like the tall guy, well you'll be seeing us more!Now the food ... absolutely delicious! The calamari was the only meh dish we had, kinda rubbery but had a delicious taste. Sorry won't be ordering that again! I love me some crunch and some tentacles in my calamari ha ha!Those other two servers would smile and be like the tall server this night would've been even more amazing! From the ambience to the food to the wine everything was just wonderful even with those two hiccups!

The ambiance is great, it was pretty packed on a Thursday night and in a great location in Castro. The service was a little slow (probably bc they were busy) and forgot our drinks until after the food came. The food was ok, I was excited for the Wagyu burger ($27) but it was a lot smaller than I expected, and the meat was SO dry I couldn't even finish it. I wish they put other toppings inside it like lettuce, pickles, or anything to give some juiciness. The fries that came with it were delicious though! My partner got a chicken dish that was tastier and more worth the price. The mashed potatoes it came with were really great! If I come back here, I would definitely try the Mac and cheese after all the positive reviews about it!\", \"While we were eating at Blind Butcher, a guy casually walks by nekkid...full frontal and everything...and hardly anyone bats an eye.Except the tourist couple whose jaws were sweeping the floor.That's what I love about The Castro...if you got the balls to, anything goes!Been eyeing The Blind Butcher since they opened in 2019 (sister resto to Dunya and Lark). And, my curiosity further grew with their hype on socials. When Plan A fell through, Blind Butcher it is because last minute rezzies were very easy to get.

While they nailed the meat temps, I didn't think the food and service was commensurate to a $100 pp dining experience. IMHO, there's plenty of other places in the city you can better spend that monies. Glad I tried it once tho.\", \"This place is so so yummy! My boyfriend found it on tik tok and we gave it a shot during one of our weekend stays in SF. We had the ribeye board and it came with shishito peppers, tomato, potatoes and a side of chimichurri.

I wouldn't think twice about coming again!\", \"Absolutely amazing food, service and ambience! It's in a busy area in the Castro so plenty of do after dinner!We loved that they were able to accommodate our big group and sat us pretty quickly. Our waiter, Curtis, was amazing and extremely attentive the entire evening. Even reading the note on open table that it was our friends birthday and brought him out birthday desserts. The food tastes just as good as it looks! Id recommend sharing the ribeye and ordering some sides. It's good enough to feed 3. It's a big boy! Our friends ordered the rosemary chicken and not pictured is the Wagyu burger which my friend said he could lick and eat the whole plate! Will be coming back soon!\", 'Came in on a wednesday night to celebrate a birthday. We had reservations so we were seated right away. There are a good amount of tables along the wall in a pretty intimate space. We noticed it was quite busy even for a wednesday. We ordered calamari, potatoes, prime rib eye, and pork chop. We loved it all. The rib eye was cooked perfectly medium and came with little potatoes and peppers on the side. The pork chop was moist and had lots of carrots and potatoes in the sauce. The calamari was thick and tasted really well with the sauce. The potatoes were a great side and perfectly cooked. We did family style and between the 3 of us, there were still some leftovers. We ordered the opera cake and tiramisu for dessert. The cakes were moist and rich and a perfect way to end our dinner. Overall i was really impressed with the food and cant wait to come back again.', 'DON\\'T LET THE NAME FOOL YOU - Great place even for vegetarians / pescatarians!!! Their Hip wood-based decor with ambient lighting makes for a cozy date night spot.Started off with some fresh fries lightly tossed in spices. Crisp outside, mushy inside (perfect)! They served some chardonnay to go with the appetizer. The main course was a family style butcher board (which my friends verified was delicious) and the lobster mac & cheese. Generous portions of lobster in the dish, with a perfect crisp cheese layer up top and gooey bits inside. The mac and cheese was served in a cast iron pan which kept it warm throughout our meal. Macaroni was al dente, and the bite on the pasta mixed so well with the mushy cheese! Service was excellent and they accommodated my vegetarian dietary preferences by serving me a Moussaka from their neighbor restaurant \"Lark\". It was mildly spiced and had lots of fresh veggies. Finally, the merlot that was served with the main course was rich with some fruity notes. Great for sipping though a conversation. Must visit the Blind Butcher!', 'I was really impressed with the branzino and the Elderberry cocktail, but less so with the practically raw shishito peppers. The service was scatterbrained and we were often left waiting long periods of time to place orders. Our two hour meal could have expediently been half that with more attentive service. The dining area was nevertheless nicely decorated and dark enough and loud enough to impart some privacy, though not so much of either to be miserable. Overall, standard overpriced meal in San Francisco.', \"Before I dive into my review, I want to mention that for me personally, food alone is 3/5, but I gave an extra star because of the ambiance.Let's talk about the food first. My friend and I ordered these dishes -1. Butcher's wagyu sliders (small bites)2. Crispy calamari3. Rack of lamb4. TiramisuWagyu sliders were definitely bigger than what I had in mind. The meat was very juicy, and the buns were soft. That, combined with the aioli sauce, made the sliders delicious. Crispy calamari wasn't much crispy and was okay. The rack of lamb was also okay. The meat was very tender and well cooked but lacked flavors. It came with horseradish sauce, but it was too strong. Tiramisu was delicious. It was very light and just the right amount of sweetness.This place is a great date night spot because of the ambiance. It's very modern, cozy, warm, and welcoming. The walls are covered with photos and paintings of old artists and San Francisco city from back in the days. There was jazz music playing in the background, and I liked it, though I wish it wasn't as loud. Our server was really nice and was on top of taking care of us.\", \"Years ago, I raved about this place and awaited the day I would come back. Unfortunately, the dishes weren't as incredible as I remembered. Besides the brussel sprouts, which were seriously the best appetizer I've had recently! Each piece was a crispy, sweet and salty morsel that would change anyone's mind about this vegetable. The Grilled Prosciutto Burrata appetizer was a favorite as well. Other than that, the wagyu burger which my group and I all ordered was pretty average. I guess in my head I hyped it up so as I ate it, it felt quite dry and underwhelming. I ordered mine cooked medium too so not sure how it didn't hold its moisture. The ciabatta was dry and complicated the burger experience too. Another dish that fell short was the truffle lobster mac and cheese. As much as I wanted to believe there was lobster in this, I feel like it was crawfish... the flavor, the size, all just insinuated crawfish in the soupy cheese sauce. It had somewhat of a fishy/seafood flavor to the dish and no noticeable truffle taste. Although the entrees underperformed, the service absolutely did not. We didn't have a reservation and they were booked for dinner, but the host made it work with some open outdoor space. He constantly made sure we were comfortable and got our food out quickly. The chef also stopped by our table throughout the meal. He was bouncing between their neighboring sister restaurants and thanked us for visiting them. I would come back for the apps, drinks, and hospitality!\", 'Cozy/moody ambiance, wonderful service, and delicious, flavorful food. We especially loved the roast chicken with veggies and potatoes, short ribs and potatoes, and the overall variety of dishes they offer. There is something for everyone, and the dishes are shareable. Drinks and dishes are on the pricier end however the quality is good. Hope to visit again soon.', \"The moment I had got there it was a great ambiance. It was a busy night and I thought I had out my reservation in but it was on the wrong day! They were very able to accommodate me anyway! Plus one star! Staff and service was very nice. Overall: 1 star added for the service alone which was very friendly, but as a food critic and something of a culinary artist myself I cannot bring myself to give this place more than one star for the food.The nitty gritty:I ordered the prime ribeye medium rare and came out super rare. The cook must have not let it sit the appropriate amount of time before cutting and serving.The octopus was undercooked as well, leaving a gummy undercooked seafood texture we all know as sashimi shrimp.However the sauce and herbs surrounding the dish was superb and I ate each bite with it.The back of the octopus was cooked perfectly so they must not have used something to hold it down as it grilled.We ordered the calamari which was greasy and the breading was soggy :(.The waygu burger was alright but still undercooked to how we had requested.Truffle fries were really good.I was really amped to go here and try it out due to the hype on social media and I feel they may be overwhelmed by all the new attention it has been receiving.The taste was all there but the preparation needs work. For the price it cost to eat here I may not be coming back.It was a nice effort though. They were pretty crowded.Edit: I actually decided to downgrade my star review because the dishes were unique and good quality. But I shouldn't be paying over 180$ for a meal that is brought out raw. I know what kind of neighborhood it is but not everyone likes it raw. Also if there is something wrong with every single dish we ordered, quality control must be instilled. Idk if he was on vacation or what but this was completely unacceptable.\", 'Welcomed and enjoyed our evening assisted by Manny. We ordered the Brussels sprouts- very tasty! Also the burrata ravioli and the short rib- plentiful portions and good flavor. Frankly the ravioli tasted more like ricotta than burrata but the freshness of the homemade pasta and the delicious sauce were fantastic. Short rib was fall off the bone and the amount of the meat was commensurate with the price. Lovely meal. We chose toeat  outdoors which was great but inside looked so cozy and hip!', \"Everything was cooked to perfection and seasoned well. I thoroughly enjoyed the steak, and absolutely loved the octopus appetizer. The service was really quick, we didn't wait long for any of our dishes, including water refills & check. Would highly recommend!\", \"Came to Blind Butcher to Celebrate my daughter's birthday and the host and everyone around was so nice and welcoming. Love the atmosphere and the food was 10/10 We all enjoyed our dinner party and will definitely be back.\", 'Celebrating an early bday for bff-fam at Blind Butcher. Ever since they posted their iconic celebratory reel on the gram, we needed to check out all the fanfare it generated. Vibes are completely chill w/ eclectic art, plush red booth seats, and dim lighting...giving jazz club vibes for cool cats. Menu is simple there are apps, protein options and whole braised branzino to feed a small family of 9...so we got two of those because why not. lol Please do not sleep on the apps: Crispy Calamari, Grilled Octopus, Shishito, Truffle French Fries... and the table ordered to share Braised Short Ribs, Lamb Chops, Ribeye Steak, & Prawns. The kid ordered their lobster truffle mac. Dylan helping our table was amazing...beautiful, attentive, and super accommodating and friendly. Made the dinner so comfortable and our groupreally enjoyed. Go here and order everything. Street parking and a lot off Castro St. entrance, we got lucky and found one right in front. Planning to revisit in the near future! Thank you/Mahalo Blind Butcher!', \"Came here for an early Father's Day celebration.  We ordered a few dishes and decided to do it family style.  Everything was delicious and came out relatively quick.  Definitely worth a revisit. My only critique is that there were 5 of us and two small round tables were put together to accommodate us.  Sitting wise we had plenty of space but once the food came it was a game of shuffle to make space.\", 'I\\'ve been wanting to try this restaurant for months. I finally got the opportunity when I had a friend visiting me for the weekend. I wanted to love this restraint so much but unfortunately our dining experience was just okay. First, our waiter changed twice so we\\'re confused on who was going to be taking care of us. We ordered some sparkling rose and champagne but when the server delivered the drinks they were confused as to which drink was which.  They even had to go back and check to make sure. To their defense the restaurant is very dim. The food was fine but nothing exceptional. We started with the burrata (w/ prosciutto) and Brussel sprouts. We shared the ravioli, spaghetti and meatballs, fillet mignon, and salad. All dishes were ok. The fillet was very rare and when we checked with the server they said that is considered \"medium\" to them. We didn\\'t want to be those people, so we just ate what we wanted and left a good portion of the steak on the plate.Probably won\\'t be returning anytime soon.', \"Sweet, kind staff, SUPERtender meat, and a cool-a$$ interior for chilling and drinking bottles of wine-- the blind butcher is easily my favorite restaurant in the Castro area. Stop by if you're in the mood for some steak, lobster Mac and Cheese, or just a cup of white wine on a hot summer day (sunshine emoji)\", \"I came here a few evenings ago for my Birthday hoping to enjoy an array of great food and drinks and was sadly disappointed. I booked through OpenTable and none of the staff mentioned it was my Birthday.I arrived for my reservation and was sat by a waiter who was largely uninterested in my presence. On the way to show me my table, another waiter blocked my path serving the table beside me. I was forced to stand between the host and the waiter for about a minute which was awkward. From then, it took about 9 minutes for the waiter to come and ask me about drinks and about another 12 for one cocktail to be made.  I started with the Octopus and the Lamb Lollipops. These took a long time to come out (25+ minutes) and the Lamb was burnt on the outside as was a reasonably sized amount of the octopus. Both were tasty once you got past the char. The salad on the Lamb was particularly good.For mains we got the sliders, the prime ribeye, potatoes and ravioli. These took an incredible amount of time to come out. The potatoes  came out 5 minutes before everything else. I did order another cocktail and had to ask the waiter a second time for the drink because I already had waited 15+ mins. The Ribeye actually came with potatoes which wasn't mentioned when I ordered.In terms of the food:Ribeye - Great. Must order!Potatoes - Meh. Mine were undercooked and honestly not that tasty.Ravioli - Solid, but not much actual pasta in the dishSliders - Very mehThis place held a Yelp Elite event a month ago. They should know better. All in all, very disappointed.\", \"Great hole in the wall it seems , beautiful ambiance & very friendly service. The food was absolutely delicious : lamb chops sooo juicy & tender I'd definitely go back !\", \"Came here to celebrate my friend's birthday, and we had such a great time. The servers are very fast, and nice. It's such a cute ambiance inside since it's dim (cute place for date nights). The music inside isn't too loud, so good place to go to for catching with friends, etc. UGH. The food's pretty good. The steak was cooked so GREAT, and it was very flavorful & juice. The mashed potatoes on the side that I ordered was also So yummy!!! Menu is so simple, but has a little bit of everything you'd want. Totally would go back again.\", \"I came in to celebrate my birthday with a group of friends and had a seamless experience calling and getting a reservation, and getting questions answered - they allow cake cutting as well as bringing your own wine bottles (their corkage fee is $25). The service was quick and friendly, and the ambiance is nice for a special occasion. They also allow for you to order vegan/vegetarian dishes from their sister restaurant Lark if your party requires accommodation. The 2 dishes I ordered were a little underwhelming. The truffle lobster Mac & cheese didn't seem like it had much truffle or lobster - the lobster pieces were small and chewy, but it was a good quantity. The lamb lollipops were tasty, but the price was a little steep at $22 for lollipops. They also brought out a piece of cake with a candle for my birthday :)I would give the food alone at this restaurant 3/5, but overall the ambiance and service brings it up to a 4 for me.\", \"The ambiance here is so lovely! The service is even better than the ambiance! We ordered the arugula salad, the grilled octopus and the lamb lollipops.The salads were quite generous. We probably could have shared one. I'm usually not a fan of sweet salads but this one was tasty indeed. The arugula was very fresh and the fruit was tasty. The octopus was prepared perfectly and hubby loved the nice tomato sauce. The lamb was fabulous. It was a bit crisp on the outside and perfectly tender and juicy on the inside. It benefited from salt which I easily added. I do feel the prices here are a bit high but overall we did enjoy our meal very much!\", \"We had been dying to eat here! And it was like we died and went to heaven  Melodramatic I know but it was THAT good! From the service to food to music to that fun ambiance... Curtis was amazing and fun on top of being attentive to our needs. We had the rib-eye, whole fish, wagyu sliders, truffle fries, burrata ... and the OMG Lobster Truffle Mac and Cheese. I can't have dairy and I was willing to hurt myself for it  Everything on the menu is definitely worth trying based on the experience we had with the dishes we ordered.Still dreaming about the Mac and Cheese. Go with a crew so you could order a lot and not feel like you had to gorge yourself. Cheers to eating well!\", '[TLDR: Generous portions, delicious and diverse food choices, extensive wine and beer list, no cocktail menu (coming soon), friendly and speedy staff.]Dining at Blind Butcher with a group made my first visit here so much more enjoyable because I got to try more than just one dish!  After being ushered to our table in the back, we started to order drinks when we were told there wasn\\'t a cocktail menu (our waitress said it should be finalized in Jan/Feb 2023) but offered to make us almost any mixed drink.  In their defense, the venue had only re-opened a few months prior, so it wasn\\'t a big deal to craft one myself.  I started off with a dirty gin martini and quickly switched to a glass of Malbec once my entree arrived. When you talk about meat falling off the bone, their braised short ribs are the prime example.  So tender, flavorful, and scrumptious!  I was a bit confused by the sauce, which the menu labeled as a \"wine jus reduction\", but the meat seemed to be doused in a tomato pasta sauce.  By no means is this a complaint, because the meat, sauce, and potatoes were incredibly delicious.  The rest of our table opted for the burger, grilled pork chops, Roka salad, and we all split the calamari to start.Our waitress brought over a bowl of salted caramel gelato for the birthday boy, complete with a candle on top!  Prices were a bit steeper than I expected, but honestly worth it for the very generous portions you receive.  Looking forward to coming back and seeing what cocktails the mixologists have been working on!', \"Wanted to review just because service was extraordinary! Not only did our server make connection with table but just the overall experience from start to end. After appetizers are finished they make sure to clear your plate and utensils and provide you with new ones for your main course. They make sure nothing unnecessary is on your table at all times and come around regularly to make sure everything is okay. Not only are we serviced the whole time but they also make sure to pack up your to go order for you when your done with your meal. It's the little things!\", \"Amazing food and ambiance. Service was on point and I can't wait to go back! Check it out.\", \"Made reservations for my partner's birthday on a Friday night. I definitely recommend making reservation as it gets pretty packed after 6pm. We got the wagyu sliders and the Roka salad to start. It was my first time having wagyu and i definitely understand the hype now, SO good. They add caramelized onions as well, and it just elevated the burger just enough to reach peak flavor. I highly recommend the Roka salad- the bits of apple and dried fig in combination with the arugula and goat cheese was perfectly sweet and savory. It ticked all the boxes for me. The prime ribeye was presented beautifully and the roasted onion, Shishito peppers, and tomato were a welcomed addition to our slab of meat. Thank god for the mound of flakey salt they provide, because the meat definitely needed an extra oomph. It was good, but now that i've tried it, I probably wouldn't order again. The mashed potatoes were decadent, perfectly creamy, but had to add a bit of that flakey salt to really bring it to flavortown. They brought over a nice slice of cake for my partner's birthday and it was perfect. Grateful for the healthy pours of wine and a full belly!\", \"Food is good especially the octopus dish,Service is good but a little off maybe I didn't get a good vibe from our server. Ambiance is fine nothing fancy but comfortable\", 'Took my BF here for bday dinner last night- food was excellent- service great! Such a cute spot - We had the calamari to start  and then the Branzino and 16 Oz ribeye - both cooked and seasoned perfectly in my opinion!I was bummed that we both did not have room for dessert! I would definitely come back :-)', 'Really nice service staff. Brunch was good (we had grilled chicken sandwiches) but we were surprised by the cost. $$$Beautiful lighting and decor. Wonderful wine selection.', 'Blind Butcher is a hidden gem in the city (CASTRO). Honestly, I love when restaurants are able to satisfy ALL MY SENSES -- visually, aesthetically, taste, and all that jazz. This is definitely one of those places.Everything we ordered was on point with the portion size, taste, and freshness. APPETIZERS:- Truffle Fries: Crispy, delicous, and truffley - Brussel Sprouts: Cooked to perfection and the char was crispy - Octapodaki: SUPER TENDER and cooked perfectly -- soft and one of the best octopus I have ever had- Crispy Calamari: Large, thick, calamari rings -- yummy seasoning and enjoyed the sauce it came with- Lamb Lollipops: Typically, not a lamb person as I did not grow up with eating lamb, but I enjoy lamb -- SOFT, TENDER, FLAVORFUL, AND COOKED PERFECTLYYYYY - Roka SaladENTREES:- Rack of Lamb: One of the best rack of lambs I have ever had. - Prime Rib: COOKED TO PERFECTION and the prime rib had a nice marbling and the fat was soo good!- Whole Grilled Branzino: My friend said it needed more seasoning, but I enjoyed the light clean fresh plain flavor. REALLY FRESH - Truffle Lobster Mac and Cheese: THEY DID NOT SKIMP OUT ON THE LOBSTER -- I could honestly eat a whole tray!- Wagyu Burger: The cibatta bread was perfect with the wagyu burger and one really delicious -- the best wagyu burger I have ever had- Prawns Girades: Large PRAWNS, cooked perfectly, tastyDESSERTS: - Opera Cake- Salted Caramel Gelato: SO DELICIOUS AND CREAMY -- paired well with the pistachio - Coppa 3 Cioccolati: Tasted like a large Ferror Rocher (REALLY GOOD AND TASTED LIKE HAZELNUT)- TiramisuWe were the first ones there and the cooks cooked our food so quickly -- seriously was in amazement with how fast they did it.

I highly recommend this place for a birthday, intimate date night, celebration, or even a solo dolo dinner while sitting at the bar. This place is seriously a hidden gem in the city and you must pass by here if you have the chance. I promise you will not be disappointed!!!!', \"As a gay man, I have to say I felt STRANGE to eat in an ALL straight client venue in The Castro. I say this because we have to deal with the str8 world all week and to be in The Castro, I expect some diversity.Food: Good, kinda pricey but the flavor justifies the price. I guess the going rate of a burger is $27 bucks??Service: At first no seats on a Friday night. We can sit outside which is fine but there's a big outdoor umbrella in the middle of a tiny table for two. As I was tried to get the waiters attention to see if we can move as he's talking to another couple, his hand raised to me, I'll be with you in a minute hand gesture. Eventually we got to sit inside. Ambience: Dark, sometimes too dark even to see your food. Rate: Would I go back? Maybe.\", \"When we drove by, I couldn't believe how packed the sidewalk was, in front of the restaurant. That definitely got me excited! Get early to your reservation, because you will be driving in circles, looking for parking. We parked four blocks away. Anyways, we eventually made it to the restaurant and waited for 10 minutes, because there was no hostess at the hostess stand. I could tell immediately, that they were understaffed, considering how busy they were. It's got a pretty cool ambience, they are playing some great electronic music and you'll love the way the place is decorated. Keep in mind, the restaurant is on the ground floor, where the garage would be, in a Victorian house. Eventually the hostess showed up and I think he was also a waiter. He told us it would be 15 minutes and it was more like a 1/2 hour. We were seated at the back of a restaurant restaurant, and our waitress showed up 10 minutes later. She was super sweet and as attentive as she could possibly be, considering they are understaffed. We ordered the Octopodaki, Lobster mac & cheese, Brussels Sprouts, Shishito Peppers, french fries, Truffle fries, Rack Lamb , Garides Bruchettes, Burrata Ravioli, Ribeye, along with a Bacardi and Coke,  an old fashioned, a lemon drop, a Shirley Temple, and two lemonades. Yes, we were there to throw down! The star of the meal was definitely the Burrata Ravioli. Everybody tried some and were blown away by the flavors. In no way am I saying the rest of the food was bad, but it was good average. I also amazed on how fast the food came out, which was great, because we were starving. I feel for the staff, because you can tell they are great people, are doing the best job they possibly can, but they are totally understaffed. Only negative about the meal, Garides Bruchettes. They were slightly over cooked and chewy. This is a popular restaurant and is noisy, keep that in mind. Also, understand that you are in the Castro and you will see things, that you will know not normally see. And it's OK. At the end of the night, we had a great time, enjoyed good food, friendly service and left satisfied. That's what it's all about. I will be back to have those Raviolis to myself.\", \"Dark, sultry,delightful We were welcomed with open arms and lovely banter as we waited for our table. A party of 3 to have dinner before seeing Morrissey perform at the Castro Theatre. I would highly recommend this spot as it's literally around the corner if your seeing a show at the theatre. The menu is small but packs a punch with it's amazing offerings. Two of us did the wagyu burger and the third the filet. The meat was deliciously presented, crafty use of mini butcher blocks as plates. The executed my request of medium rare to slightly more rare, utter heaven- melted in my mouth. We were looking for cocktails but only found a massive and very lovely selection of wines, however our waiter told us they had a full bar and could make anything we requested. They served us up two greyhounds and an amaretto sour - perfection! I will definitely be back to indulge again! Thank you, Blind Butcher for an impeccable dining experience\", \"The food here is still pretty good, but the size and quality has gone down and prices have gone up. We went in recently and noticed their $50 ribeye had jumped up to $70. Quite an increase and was upset to see that. I understand the need to increase price based on the cost of ingredients, but it seemed like a ridiculously high jump. Even more disappointing - the tiny portion of calamari, and the flavorless chimichurri. I don't know what happened. The first time I came here I was BLOWN AWAY by the ribeye with chimichurri. It was fresh and zesty and so delicious on the steak. What I got last time tasted old somehow...like it came out of a jar. It definitely did not offer the same fresh, flavorful punch that I'd experienced before. It wasn't even green anymore...it had taken on a darker almost brown color. Super unappetizing. I'm sad to say that I'll probably start looking for another go to place to celebrate in the city.\", \"Food: 5/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5 Overall the place serves amazing food! High price but definitely worth the cost for the amazing meal we had. Service could've been better but I think it's cause some of the staff is new, and so I think they'll improve over time. The music was loud at times but still very nice environment.Food: - Prime ribeye: chefs kiss so good! So flavorful didn't even need the chimichurri sauce- truffle fries: perfectly light hint of truffle not over powering- Kale salad: best kale salad I've ever had!- Rotisserie chicken: filling and very flavorful - Dessert: coppa 3 cioccolatto amazingly light and chocolateyService: we got seated in a less than optimal spot and the server had no idea where to place us. Unfortunately, it was by the sliding door and it kept getting open and hitting our table. Other than that, they were very attentive and got us our food very quickly.\"]\n",

He was not assigned to our table but he helped us from beginning to end .', 'Everything here was excellent from the food to the ambiance to the service. Luis took care of us and was attentive, receptive, and friendly!', \"Fog Harbor is located on the second floor of Pier 39 overlooking the Fisherman's Wharf strip. We went at night and were fortunate to get a window seat with direct view spanning the Wharf area with the new ferris wheel all the way to the Golden Gate. Very beautiful.Although being in a major tourist location, the restaurant with sitting bar acts and runs like a well oiled mid range establishment you would find in any downtown loacation. We had a 15 minute wait so we sat at the bar and had a drink, I recommend the Fog Harbor Lager if you like the easy drinking stuff.Our menu:Blue cheese bread - buttery, cheesy, garlicky goodness. Will always order this!Crab cakes - Super fresh and meaty.Clam Chowder - amongst the best we have had in SF.Cioppino - No noodles, just fish. Extremely fresh and amazing fish with garlic toast in a tomato broth. Sooo good. As for Shawn, our waiter, he should be next up for employee of the month because he was personal, interactive and made us laugh. Bravo sir!The prices are a tiny bit scary not Halloween scary, actually very reasonable for a tourist area.\", 'Our server was fantastic and other staff was friendly. Another employee stopped by to help me tie my bib. I personally had a great experience celebrating my birthday. The calamari was great and we had the seafood platter for 2 , the shrimp was someOf the best tasting shrimp my personal favorite seafood of the smorgasbord. The pasta complimented the rest of the meal- yummy!Pleasantly intimate atmosphere for being in a touristy spot.', 'We asked Google where to find the best clam chowder. We were not disappointed. Everything was great.First off, our server \"Bong Jovi\" was delightful. Very helpful and very attentive. Old school service at a great venue.Everyone was helpful. The restaurant was full, but everyone was attentive. Our used plates were quickly cleared by whoever happened to walk by. Even the manager stopped by to ask how our meal was, and HE took a plate.We started with crab cakes (amazing) and blue cheese bread (delicious).Claim chowder was the best we\\'ve ever had. It had the texture of mashed potatoes,  and the most amazing tastes.Half an order of fresh oysters were delicious, and a lobster roll too. Sadly we left no room for dessert, but we did see the dessert tray and it looked good enough to come back just for dessert. There are a lot of restaurants on the Pier. This is one you should not miss.', \"Hubby and I recently got the chance to try out Fog Harbor Fish House! It's been on our list of spots to check out in SF for awhile. Luckily, his sister has been here several times and spoke very highly of this restaurant.RESERVATIONS: Recommended! Fog Harbor is top rated on Yelp when you search SF. It's in a prime location therefore we highly suggest making reservations.AMBIANCE: Casual with amazing views of the bay. The restaurant has big glass windows around its entirety overlooking the bay. Even on their patio, they have dividers that give you privacy but you also get beautiful views of the bay and the bridge. MENU/FOOD: They have a large selection of foods as well as a seasonal menu. The average prices were $20-$50 per plate. We each opted for their clam chowder and also for their lobster ravioli, clam linguine with alfredo sauce, and mixed grill. All of these items came in fairly large portions, large enough to share. The clam chowder here is very delicious. Very creamy and loaded with so much clam. They gave complimentary sourdough rolls which complemented the chowder. The clam linguine is also creamy and the linguine is cooked to a perfect al dente. The lobster ravioli was superb. The ravioli skin was soft and held flavorful bites of lobster with ricotta. The lobster tasted so fresh! As for the mixed grill, it was our favorite! We substituted the shrimp for more salmon. The salmon was very tender and the seasoning on the salmon was out of this world. We couldn't get enough of it! The mashed potatoes were very creamy and the grilled vegetables were very refreshing with a hint of lemon. OVERALL EXPERIENCE: Easily one of our top favorite restaurants at SF officially. We understand the high ratings behind Fog Harbor now. The food is outstanding and the service was great. They were very accommodating towards us by opening their patio for us to enjoy a meal with our pug. Even though we were the only party outside, our waitress made sure we were well taken care of. We couldn't stop talking about the amazing food and experience here at Fog Harbor. We will always stop by here anytime we visit SF moving forward!\", \"I was finally able to come back to this fantastic restaurant and this time, I brought nine family members with me. I spent the day talking this place up and hoped they wouldn't make a liar out of me.I'm happy to report that they lived up to the hype once again. Everybody at the table, including my mom who's a bit picky, loved Fog Harbor.I went with a cup of the clam chowder (never come here without ordering at least the cup) as a starter and the filet mignon with potato mash and wilted spinach as my entree.I've been to many steak houses and can honestly say the filet mignon I had here was among the best I've had. It was cooked to perfection and while I don't feel it needed it, the delicious demi glaze took it up a notch.We're currently planning a trip to the city this spring with our closest friends for their anniversary and I've already decided to treat them to dinner here. Seriously, I can't say enough. Great experience every time.\", 'We\\'re giving FOG HARBOR the TOP Five 5 Star rating based on a few factors.First off, it has to fight the stigma of residing in Pier 39, known by locals in SF as a \"tourist trap\" type location.  It\\'s actually high quality as an experience and the food portions, taste and prices are fair.  We were expecting to be gauged and get sub-part quality being at Pier 39.If this relocated to any other area in SF, it would probably be at the top of many local\\'s lists, especially if parking was easy and traffic wasn\\'t gridlocked to get to.So, if you\\'re a tourist and see this place and worry about it being questionable with so many other choices, the right decision is to look at the menu first and if you see stuff you like, go here and don\\'t roll the dice on other places which may not give you a solid experience as Fog Harbor does and has/had for us.We\\'re locals in SF but came with visiting tourists, and everyone was happy.We had the Clam Chowder and one comment on the table was it wasn\\'t \"Salty\" (a negative would be being salty) and that it was served \"Hot\" (and that\\'s a good trait to be piping hot and allowed to cool down rather than come warm and end up being cold.We had the Halibut, Sole and Swordfish without any complaints and completely empty plates after indulging in the entrees.Yeah, they charge the dreaded \"5% SF Employee Mandate \"Tax\" Surcharge\" which I think all San Francisco restaurants do, on top of the 8.625% sales tax then whatever you end up tipping... so you are leaving paying 30%+ more than the menu list price on everything.  That\\'s more of a comment on the state of San Francisco\\'s policies than anything this restaurant can control or is at any blame for.The service was friendly, fast and accommodating.  They asked about food allergies and tastes/dislikes ahead of ordering, being very conscientious of their customers needs.They give complimentary rolls and butter which is always a huge plus never to be taken for granted.On a weekend night, you can find street parking for under $1 an hour as opposed to parking in the Pier 39 parking structure or paid parking lots.I\\'d recommend this spot to all.', \"This restaurant is so beautiful as you get to sit right by the pier. The waiters are so friendly and will provide great service. This place is such a great date spot or a nice place to eat. The seafood here is so fresh. Seared Pacific Cod - 4/5- the garbanzo beans overpowered the cod itself however if you ate the cod on its own with the aioli it tastes amazing. the fish was so fresh which made this dish more rich and flavorful. I'd highly recommended this if you are craving cod. Shrimp Brochette - 5/5- the shrimp was beautifully cooked. the butter had such a rich smell and when you put it on the shrimp it tasted amazing. the mashed potatoes were a bit bland but the green beans were cooked so well. Crab Ravioli- 4/5- the ravioli itself was very cheesy and the crab pieces on top tasted amazing. the whole dish was amazing overall but it was a bit too greasy for me. you also only get 4 large pieces of ravioli Calamari- 5/5- you could tell the calamari is fresh and not stored in the frozen fridge for over a month. it had a nice texture and it was perfectly fried.Overall i would come back here because the food is amazing and the ambience is so nice.\", \"Visited Fog Harbor for the first time as my mother was visiting the city! Both of is are pretty serious seafood lovers and I have to say, Fog Harbor didn't disappoint!It was prime dinnertime around 6:30, but we had a reservation so seating wasn't an issue whatsoever. We got seated with a beautiful view of the water and got busy ordering!To start, we got the blue cheese garlic bread which was surprisingly good. I'm not usually a blue cheese person but I found these toasty and more importantly, yummy. I will say though it's a big portion, and it was definitely too much for just my mother and I, but that's a good thing! 7.5/10For mains, I ordered the Shellfish Platter which was this huge assortment of shellfish with a slice of toasted bread and warm garlic butter noodles beneath it all. Once again, it was a huge serving I barely finished and it was really good! It was a tad on the oily end, but I'd recommend it if you love all things shellfish! 8/10Lastly, my mother ordered the scallop and crab risotto and this was the star of the table. It was fluffy and full of flavor, the scallops were seared to perfection, and I couldn't help but keep stealing bites! 9/10Overall, Fog Harbor is a super solid seafood spot with good views, great food, and excellent service. Would highly recommend it if you love seafood!\", 'Such a wonderful spot! We got the clam chowder bowl with the sourdough bread and crab meat. This was my first time trying clam chowder and we absolutely loved it. We accompanied our lunch with calamari. I would definitely come here again and recommend to anyone checking Pier 39 out! Wait was 15-20 minutes to be seated on a Saturday in November, so not at all bad.', \"This is a must-visit for seafood lovers. Their Cioppino is packed with a variety of fresh seafood in a flavorful tomato broth. The Blue Cheese Garlic Bread is a delicious appetizer, and the Mussel Fries are a unique and tasty dish. Don't miss their Award Winning Clam Chowder served in a sourdough bread bowl. The Fish & Chips are crispy and satisfying. Overall, the food is delicious, the service is attentive, and the atmosphere is pleasant. Highly recommended.Ambiance - 5 StarsService - 5 StarsFood - 5 Stars\", \"I took family here while we were sightseeing in San Francisco.  I was excited seeing this is one of the top reviewed restaurants in Fisherman's Wharf and was able to get last minute reservations.  We arrived early but the hostess was able to seat us which was great because the restaurant was packed already and there were groups of people waiting to get in outside.  They guided us to our table, past the gorgeous floor to ceiling windows in front of the water and saw many people with full unobstructed views.  We were so disappointed to find out that they had a separate back room cramped with many small tables and situated in such a way that only half the guests had views of the window.  It doesn't seem fair however they decide which parties get to sit in the main dining room vs the back room.  The food was OK, the clam chowder is supposedly award winning but it was very average to me.  I had the mussel fries which needed much more broth and garlic aioli on top of the fries.  I guess if I ever came back I would make sure to call ahead and get a table in front of the windows so everyone can enjoy.\", \"I highly recommend the Fog Harbor Fish House.  This restaurant is located at pier 39, which may cause to concern that it's a tourist trap, and while Fog Harbor certainly is popular, this is a legitimate and amazing place to eat.  The views of San Francisco Bay are sweeping and there is not a seat in the house that does not offer beautiful views.  The restaurant layout is spacious but cozy and warm, and the wait staff and service are spectacular and make you feel welcome and appreciated.  One last thing - the food!  Wow the food is a delicious tour of the city's favorite seafood fare.\", \"We decided to have lunch at Fog Harbor Fish House. Upon arrival, we were seated within just 5 minutes. The restaurant's ambiance was delightful, even though it was crowded. Our server, Nick, was both friendly and helpful, guiding us in making our meal choices. We went with his recommendations and ordered the crab cakes, clam chowder, salmon, and shellfish platter. The food was great and worth the hype.\", \"Their killer clam chowder - seriously heavy and packed with flavor that sticks with you - is where it's at. Their garlic fries is also a must try, makes you lingering for more. The linguine pasta is okay and does not steal the spotlight like the chowder. The place itself vibes as it's in a touristy area, adding to the whole experience. If you're all about that hearty, soul-warming clam chowder in a cozy setting, this is a solid choice.\", 'When I see claims of \"the best\" or  \"world famous\", I can\\'t help but try out the thing to see if it is indeed, the best. Fog Harbor Fish House has been awarded the Best Seafood Restaurant in San Francisco and has award-winning Clam chowder. Being the best in San Fran is a bold claim, so I made it a point to stop here while exploring Pier 39. In case you\\'re ever looking for this place, know that it is on the second floor, so you need to go upstairs to get the front door. I made a reservation through Yelp a couple days in advance for a table for 1 for lunch. My reservation was honored and I was seated right away. The view from my table by the window was great; it overlooked the pier and I had a good time watching sea lions play and swim as further out tour ships arrived and left. On to the food. I ordered just one thing - a cup of clam chowder. There is an option to add crab meat, but I decided against it (hint: add the crab for a tastier soup). With no modifications, the clam chowder was pretty tasty. It was hot and I enjoyed eating it alongside the complementary bread and butter. Would it win my award for best chowder... the verdict is still out because it\\'s the first clam chowder I\\'ve ever had haha. I can say I would like more clam in the soup and that adding crab would have made a big difference. Seeing as I could have had another bowl... or two, I can concede that it\\'s a darn good clam chowder. If I hadn\\'t had a plane to catch, I would also try the Crab Cakes and the Seared Scallop & Crab Risotto. Next time!', 'We love Fog Harbor Fish House. Each time we have been there, we enjoy every aspect of it. This last time our waiter Sean or Shawn was extra exceptional. He helped us with our food selection and all his suggestions were right now. We both enjoyed our dishes. And we received a birthday surprise.We will be back for sure.(Oops I started this review like 3 weeks ago and never finished, sorry!)', \"This was genuinely one of the best meals I've ever had. I will definitely be back again whenever I'm in San Francisco again!Food:-Clam chowder: This was so good. It was nice and thick with a lot of clams. The seasoning was perfect and the mini sourdough roll was also delicious and paired perfectly with the clam chowder.-Scallop and crab risotto: I love risotto, and this was maybe the best risotto I've had. It looked pretty small from the photos, but it was actually a normal meal size portion. I ended up not being able to finish it all after eating the clam chowder too. The scallops were tender and seared well, and I was happy they weren't over cooked at all. The risotto was nice and buttery with a nice crab flavor. My favorite part of this dish was definitely the scallops. It was a bit on the salty side, but everything else about this dish was so good I still will give it a 5/5.Service and setting: The wait staff was so friendly and quick. I didn't have to wait too long for my food. The view was beautiful, especially the large windows the overlook the bay. You can see the sea lions and Alcatraz out the window.\", \"So let's presume that you are out on a pier in San Francisco and you want some of the best seafood you've ever had.  Everybody in my family was satisfied and pleased with what they got and boy boy did we order everything from baked fish, to fish and chips, to delicious sourdough bread sides\", 'Food was just Zoe.  Not bad not great.  Recommended to try with open mind Staff not real attentive', 'Food was delicious! Everything we tried was so fresh and delicious. Our server Shawn was great, he recommended adding shrimp to the risotto and that was delicious. Also super attentive, nice and helpful. View in the restaurant is beautiful right over the water and it was busy but we felt relaxed and not rushed at all. Great environment inside. Totally recommend for a nice or casual dinner!', \"The food was very good.  There was four of us so we had a variety of food and it was all enjoyed. We began with clam chowder, one cup with crab (at extra cost) and one without.  Each was excellent. Two of us had crab ravioli. It was delicious.  Minimal sauce was left on either of the plates, it was that good. Another of us had the Petrale Sole.  It was plated beautifully.  The sole is served with just enough spinach, potatoes, and a pesto caper sauce.  My friend said it was quite tasty.I had the Pesto Chicken Pasta.  This was very rich in pesto and yet didn't have an over appealing taste.  It, too, came with spinach.  Also tomatoes, peppers and onions, but something was missing to make it flavorful.My friend had some wine that was listed at one price, but then charged a few dollars more. We verified before leaving the menu to see why we may have been mistaken in the price. It turned out the smaller glass was the cost we thought.   I think the waiter should have clarified with my friend as to what size glass she may have wanted.  It's all good, she enjoyed her wine.  The restaurant was very nice, quite busy and we had a beautiful harbor view.  Service was prompt.\", 'Pier Side Bites At first glance I thought this would be a little \"chainy\" but I was mistaken.  We were deciding on a meal or tasting several apps to split.  Our waiter Bongjovi was attentive and prompt in checking on us.  We chose the Mussel fries, Clam Chowder, Baked Bruschetta and the Ahi Poke Stack.  All three delish and when/if we are back in SF, I want to try the Fish & Chips. Clam chowder was super creamy, not fishy and full of ingredients. Mussel fries were a neat take on the classic French fry but mussels in a cream sauce. Baked Bruschetta was my favorite. The balsamic drizzle mixed with the baked bread was perfect.  Never had it baked before and it really enhances the dish.  Ahi Poke was also very nice.  We could have used a few more wonton chips (we didn\\'t ask so that\\'s my fault). The avocado on the bottom, the diced mango and the ahi tuna topper was perfection. Overall, delicious place to spend on the water if you are wanting the fresh seafood dishes.', \"The 5 of us got here around 5:30pm and didn't have to wait for a table. They started us with warm complimentary sourdough rolls with butter which were good.- Clam chowder bread bowl: the soup was really good (I detest it when places make it more 'high end' which usually means bland), but I echo the reviews that suggest getting a bowl rather than a bread bowl so that you get more soup.- Seafood penne: This was my favorite out of the dishes. A flavorful tomato sauce with pasta that wasn't overcooked with lots of seafood.- Shellfish platter for 2: This has a garlic butter taste over the seafood which was nice, as the linguine on the bottom soaked up a lot of the sauce.- Whole Dungeness crab: Got this for my dad and he really liked it. I appreciated the steamed green beans and peppers.It was my dad's birthday and they gave us a complimentary 'Brookie' dessert which had a nice ice cream.\", \"The food was not all that. I had crab cakes . The middle was mushy. The sauce it sat in was not flavorful at all. The mangos on the salad looked mushy. Like things weren't fresh. The garlic cheese bread was just cheese. No garlic at all. It was so uneventful. I was really sad . I wanted to enjoy this. The people were nice , the restaurant was beautiful. The restroom was clean and smelled good. I ended up leaving hungry . Now im going to my concert looking for food!\", 'All the food was delicious and the place was cozy and felt like I was in Italy. And the serving people were friendlyServing time is kind', \"Went in for an anniversary date and it was the perfect place! We were seated near the window and watch the sunset over Alcatraz from our table. The perfect backdrop to our perfect dinner. Bongjovi was our server and he was fabulous. He was very attentive and checked on us often. He even suggested I get the strawberry lemonade over the strawberry basil nojito because I was a bit iffy on the amount of basil. The drink was great. I also let him surprise me with my dinner choice because his energy was so high. He was very friendly and made our visit so much better. Now for the food... it was great! We started with a bowl of clam chowder. This is hands down the best clam chowder in San Francisco. Don't leave without trying it! We also had the caesar salad which was made with whole romaine and dressed perfectly. For our meals we had the crab topped new york steak and the cioppino (chosen by Bongjovi!). Both meals were great. The cioppino had lots of seafood in it and the broth was good. I would absolutely recommend eating here for a celebration or even a casual bite while you're on the wharf.\", \"A friend recommended this place to me. The host was kind and sat my friend and I immediately. We told the host we were only there for an appetizer and a spot at the bar would be fine. They sat us at a table in the restaurant though.We told the waitress we were really excited to try the blue cheese garlic bread. That is what a friend recommended to us! The waitress wrote it down and asked if we wanted anything else, we said no and she made a scoffing noise (like she was mad we only wanted the bread). My friend felt pressured to order something else so she got a glass of wine. My friend said the wine was alright.... she regretted getting it.The bread finally came and we both tried it! You can definitely taste the cheese first and the garlic later on. Personally not my fave but my friend loved it and ate it right up! The waitress came by and dropped off the check (not asking if we wanted anything else or how the bread and wine were). My friend and I were engaged in conversation and so we didn't take out our credit cards immediately. The waitress came by 5 times all withing minutes of each other. We felt very pressured to get out. My friend wasn't even done with her wine..... She gave the waitress her card and then quickly finished the wine. We couldn't get out of there fast enough.Overall the food was good, the wine was ok, the service was pushy....\", 'Delicious clam chowder. Amazing views, and had a very kind server named Daniela who made the experience even better. View of farris wheel as well as Alcatraz. Reasonable pricing as well. Great experience on this mother daughter trip to pier 39 at Fog house fish house.', \"This place was truly a gem not only did me and my date  have an amazing time our server was extremely polite the prices weren't crazy and now I wanna come back and get the garlic crab I love this place we wanted a bigger seat and the server had no problem accommodating Wish I woulda took a pic of the food but I told my date I wouldn't pick my phone up lol Thank yall for helping me secure not only a queen but a great person I appreciate it fasho\", \"Stopped by here for a late lunch/early dinner before seeing Greg Alan over at the Masonic. Our waiter was Luis and he was incredibly attentive. He checked in on us frequently and even offered to take our picture when our food came out. My partner and I ordered crab cakes, half order of oysters, and two clam chowder bowls. It came out to about $82. I'll talk about each item in the order of how I would rank them:1) The crab cakes took the award this round. It was a decent size, crispy on the outside, and and perfectly falls apart on the inside. Great crab flavors too. The sauce paired with it was fantastic. I could have licked the plate clean if it wasn't frowned upon by society. It also comes with a small mango(?) salad on the plate.2) The oysters were very tiny. I realize the fancier the place, the smaller the oysters. Merp. However, it tasted fresh and clean (if you know, you know) and wasn't gritty.3) The clam chowder was HOT, just the way I like my soup. Great flavor, good quantity of clams; however, as I write about this 2 days later, that's all I remember of it. Would I order it again? Sure. Perhaps not in a sourdough bowl though.I'd visit this place again if it were a special occasion. But for some regular chowder, I might go elsewhere.\", \"Indulging in the finest lobster roll of my life was an absolute delight! The lobster roll's quality here is the best I've ever had. Served with a generous side of melted butter, and the option to order more, it's truly the epitome of this dish. The clam chowder was delightful, but the star is undoubtedly the lobster roll. The stellar staff, including the hostess, waitress, and bartender, made the experience even more memorable with their exceptional kindness and assistance. This restaurant has the best quality staff and food by far out of all of Pier 39! Should I find myself at Pier 39 again, there's no doubt this is the only place I'd choose to eat at. The bustling crowd during my visit speaks volumes - undoubtedly the best restaurant on Pier 39! :)\", \"If you want some delicious seafood and an awesome view of the bay .... This is your stop. Busy busy busy restaurant; but service is still really good and food comes out faster than expected.  We ordered the clam chowder; boy was it tasty and hearty. Felt like I was back on the east coast. Very hot temperature wise; which I loved and good. Good mixture of clams, bacon, veggies and chowda.  The calamari is bomb; even includes fried onions and jalapeños.... Cooked to perfection; and light and tasty.  Ordered the lobster roll; omg one of the best lobster rolls I've ever had. The brioche bun being toasted and the hot side of butter added the icing to the top. The lobster was tender, meaty and there was a good amount of it. My taste buds were in seafood heaven.  I felt like I was in another level after eating here. So freaking good!\", 'For the price we were really expecting a better experience.  The service is really terrible and the food is meh.  We were sat and ignored for at least 10 minutes. Our waiter showed up and simply asked \"are you ready to order\". We got a cup of clam chowder to start which came with rolls. The rolls were great but the chowder was very thick and very bland. The food was delivered in a timely manner but we could not get our waiter back to the table to get another drink.  Both salad and salmon were \"just ok\". The view was pretty and if you go at sunset even better.  It\\'s our silver lining for the dinner fail.', \"Waterfront side during a Blue Angels show = perfect day! 5 of us walked up to the hostess, and we told her we wanted outdoor seating. Wait time was only 2 mins... Seems people were not used to 85-degree weather in San Fran lol. So we sat down, and the waiter took a bit before coming w menus. The food was great - I tried their famous clam chowder, fried calamari, oysters, and lobster roll. It was very fresh and flavorful. The Spritz blackberry drink was delicious.. I ordered 3! Overall, it's a great restaurant for people watching and enjoying the good weather while eating superb food!\", 'Food was delicious!! The garlic butter crab was the best I have had in a long time!!The waitress was quick and friendly. Got our food hot!', \"I wish I had more of an appetite when I visited here. There were so many options on the menu that I wanted to try. I had room for a cup of clam chowder, though! I asked for a side of bread vs. getting a bread bowl, and my server was happy to accommodate anything I wanted--amazing! So was the clam chowder. The Caesar salad was just ok to me, though.My server recommended the Blood Orange Margarita. I'd never had one that included egg whites, but the foam was a nice touch!I'm currently trying to figure out a way to return before I head back home. This is a great restaurant and good representation of the foodie scene here in SF.\", \"Came here for lunch since we heard it was good even though it's at a super touristy area. We ordered:- clam chowder with crab meat: Really rich and creamy. Lots of crab meat. I would get this again.- clams: Very tasty and flavorful. Maybe only 1 or 2 were not open. Kids loved them.- scallops with crab risotto: Scallops cooked beautifully. Risotto flavorful, rich and creamy. The crab was it and unfortunately couldn't taste too much of it.Overall, for a restaurant in a super touristy area, it is really good.\"]\n",

      "Reviews: ['This place has very good alfredo here and the customers they gave me was awesome, I will def give them a try if your out in the bay area. My wife thought I was exaggerating until I had to ring her ha', \"Came here on a Saturday night without a reservation. We waited for 40 minutes before we were seated. I'm normally not a huge fan of Italian but this is one of my favorite Italian spots in the bay.Not so - it was refreshing and the grapefruit really toned down the sweetness.Dungeness Crab Arancini - crispy on the outside. I loved how it was topped with pickled pepper radish and coated with scallion aioli. It was so good.Handkerchief - I'm always a fan of Bolognese so when I saw this white Bolognese, I knew I had to order it. It was so creamy but still felt light because the pasta was paper thin. I also loved how the pasta came out piping hot.Bucatini - the pistachio pesto got me to order this. The tomato based sauce was so light and tangy. The cheese on top added a little bit of creaminess. The pistachio pesto worked surprisingly well with the tomato sauce.\", \"Leaving a four star review because I think Yelpbiased higher scores but let's be clear this place was average, especially for food.Just being upfront the food was overpriced and over salted. It's not that it was bad per se, but not worth what Pearl is charging. Nothing was bad but nothing was memorable at all.If you're coming here, stick around for the service and pleasant atmosphere. Those were highlights.\", 'Want to have a great meal in a lovely place?  Try Pearl.   Being a single patron, I sat at the bar although I was given a choice to sit outside.  Both options seemed quite good.  And the staff was tip-top.Roasted cauliflower with sliced almonds, raisins and a black tahini hummus sauce was a great way to begin my meal.  The plate was well composed and the spicing was nuanced and subtle.Next up, seared scallops with spaetzle, corn and braised onions was a wonderful main course.  The crisp exterior of each large scallop encased an interior that was not overcooked.  And the sweet corn enlivened the entire plate.In and out and home to walk the dog while it was light.   And parking on Sunday evening was easy.', \"Pearl is my favorite restaurant in SF!I've tried a decent amount of their menu and everything is delicious! Starter, mains, dessert, drinks, everything!!! I try to stop by every few months to try their seasonal dishes.I had a work dinner here a few months back and my out of town colleagues all loved their meal here! Interior is very cute and service has always been great. They don't take reservations over 6 people so probably not the best for large groups, unless you're ok with splitting up the group into smaller tables.I love their cauliflower! I order it every time. For mains, all of their pastas are fantastic and I've loved every scallop seasonal dish I've had. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. My favorite cocktail is the tidy tips. Can't wait until my next visit!\", \"One of my favorite restaurants in the city! I love that it's hidden in the Richmond. I've come twice now and both times, the food was amazing and service was exceptional.I love trying their pastas, but everything is delicious. You can't go wrong with any of it.\", \"This is only my second time here, but it's become one of my favorite restaurants. I don't eat too much salad, but Pearl's Caesar is the exception. Their Caesar has a strong taste of anchovies, creating the perfect umami. If you're not a fan of anchovies, this salad may not sit will with you lol. It's lemony, cheesy, and the crispy prosciutto and croutons elevate the salad really well. I could eat this by myself if I tried, but of course I shared it with my boyfriend lol.Their steak tartare is the standard for me - whenever I order it elsewhere, it never compare to Pearl's. Beefy, lemony, and full of flavor. The texture pairs very well with the crisps they provide.The bavette steak was really good according to my boyfriend. He barely shared any with me and devoured it lol. I would love to order this next time if its on the menu.A few gripes..The Gemelli - first bite was delicious, full of flavor. I loved the spice and combination of the capers and sun dried tomatoes. The tuna was cooked well. The thing is - the more I ate, I soon came to realize how salty the dish was. I love salt and all things savory, but it became difficult to eat. I love olives, but their olives made the pasta even saltier considering the capers and spice. They really need to lighten their hand when seasoning this dish lol. I would have returned the dish had I not waited so long for it. This brings me to my next point..The wait - It was busy. I will not deny that. We were lucky enough to snag a reservation. Our Rez was at 730, and we came right on time and was seated immediately. We ordered maybe within the next 5 minutes. Our apps came out pretty fast, and I'd say we were done eating them by 810? The thing is, our entrees didn't come out until 840. Every single table around us had gotten their food before us, despite having came after us. The table to our left only ordered entrees - ok, that I understand. But the table seated directly behind us came a good 20 minutes after us, and also ordered apps, yet their entrees were also delivered before ours. The table to our right had completely finished eating before we even got our entrees. It was disappointing, as the service was subpar. I understand it's busy, but the waitress (Katie I believe) didn't pay us any mind and we had to flag her down to receive updates regarding our order. I'm willing to wait, so long as it doesn't feel like our order was forgotten lol. It felt like that. The waitress didn't seemed concerned that we were waiting that long. I honestly think she forgot to put our entrees in? Either that, or they need to work on their timing with the delivery of apps and entrees. I will surely be returning and will be supporting this business, but would recommended avoiding the dinner rush as much as possible. I'm sure it's much better when they open right at 5. Overall, this restaurant deserves their flowers despite the underwhelming service.\", 'It was soooo good! Food is amazing! Definitely must visit place for amazing experience.', \"Ambiance: I booked an inside table for 8pm on a Sunday. It was charming and lively. Very nice for a date night. Service: Attentive and nice!Oysters: 4/5Solid - texture was smooth and the toppings complimented the oyster. Acme bread and butter: 4/5Solid, but nothing special - what I'd expect from complimentary bread and butter from the table, except this time it was a $4 chargeChicory Caesar: 5/5Amazing! I love the texture and taste of the crispy prosciutto with crisp mixed lettuce. The croutons were also great. Everything worked well together. Handkerchief: 4/5Solid pasta, and best pasta of the night. I haven't had a white bolognese before. It was light and easy to eat. If I were to make this at home, I would add maybe a touch of truffle oil to add more to the dish. Bucatini: 4/5Loved the stracciatellla with the pesto and basil. I thought the dish was okay at first, but it grew on me with each bite that I took. Buttermilk Panna Cotta: 5/5Silky panna cotta, absolutely lovely with the strawberries and the chocolate sable. Olive Oil Cake: 5/5This was my favorite out of the two desserts I tried. The texture of the cake was everything and more. The ice cream worked well with the cake too. If you were to choose between the cake and the panna cotta, choose the cake!Overall, solid food. I wouldn't go back for the pasta, but definitely for the desserts and caesar salad!\", \"Food:The cauliflower was what I ordered and it was surprisingly delicious. The raisins balanced out the savory aspects and really made the dish stand out. Service:Perfect, we saw that everyone was very warm and friendly and attentive.Ambiance: It's lively but also romantic. This is good for friends or for a date.\", \"The food at Pearl is delicious!  I've been twice and ordered different apps, mains and dessert, and both times I was delighted with each bite.  The staff are friendly and attentive, making customers feel at home.  The cocktail list is inventive and the bar tenders execute them well.\", \"I took my husband to Pearl for his dinner and we had a wonderful time. The atmosphere was very welcoming, it was cozy, and we felt like we could relax. Our waitress was nice and gave us helpful recommendations. We ended up having the Kanpachi Crudo, the Hankerchief Pasta, and the Seared Scallops. All were very tasty and I would have again. My only slight disappointment was that I put that it was his birthday on the reservation, when I was texting to confirm the reservation, and the waitress when we sat down. Despite all of this, they didn't bring a candle with the chocolate cake we ordered. I know this is small, but it's a nice thing that restaurants do and it doesn't cost much - I was a little sad that it made it slightly less birthday festive.\", \"First time back in over 4 years. Was surprised that the menu hasn't changed too much. Overall, still a solid meal especially the tartare and pastas.Halibut crudo: Fish was refreshing, but thought the peanuts and jalapeño overpowered some of the more subtle flavors.Chicory Caesar: enjoyed the garlic croutons and certainly a more hearty salad.Roasted cauliflower: Really enjoyed the charred smoky flavors and the black tahini hummus.Steak tartare: one of my favorite dishes of the night. Super savory without feeling too heavy.Mt. Lassen Trout: Fish had nice flavors, but was a bit over cooked IMO.Handkerchief: One of their signature dishes. Pasta had a great al dente texture. Would order again.Gemelli: Nice bounce to the pasta and enjoyed the freshness of the peas.Cocktails: Prices were pretty good for SF standards ($14)Birds Eye: Essentially an old fashioned. Wasn't necessarily too creativeCoastal scrub: Refreshing and citrus profile.\", \"One of my favorite Mediterranean/Italian spots in SF, with consistently great service delicious plates, and creative cocktails. The menu changes with the regularly with only the freshest ingredients. I have yet to be disappointed.The space is causal, warm, cozy, spacious, and romantic all at once, along with a beautiful bar.They have an outdoor option, equipped with heating lamps.Plates this visit:-Wood oven gulf prawns - Fresh Gulf shrimp wood oven roasted to perfection in Diabla and served with Zhuhai crème fraiche.-Roasted cauliflower - Love the different textures and flavors in this dish, the smokiness of the cauliflower, smoothness of the of the black tahini hummus, and the crunch of the almonds-Seared scallops - So fresh and perfectly seared served with delicious butter beans, spinach ragout, maitake mushrooms and caper relish.-Spaghetti - Tossed with fresh Manila clams and delicious nasturtium, watercress and fermented Chile.-Radiatori  - Prepared al dente in a delicious lamb merguez sugo, finished with fresh sheep feta and lemon oil.Thank you Chef and and service team.See y'all next time.\", 'My rating is a solid 4.5/5. The service was impeccable. I came with two toddlers and was seated immediately on a Friday afternoon. Our waitress was named Alice and she had great communication, was kind to my girls, and offered to get their food in first which helped immensely! I order the scallops and Brussel sprouts . The Brussel sprouts came out first and highly recommend! However the scallops took a very long time to come out and seared nicely however some were not cooked properly. And for that minus .5 stars. I will definitely be returning to try their cocktails, dessert and more menu items.', \"Pearl 6101 sits on a quiet street, but the restaurant and bar are bustling and busy. It has wonderful and beautiful interior, with great food, good service and a cozy and homey atmosphere. It's definitely a great place for a date night or a night out with friends. Drinks: Pearl Cocktail (5/5)My sister and I came in and had the pearl cocktail which was recommended to us by the waiter. It's a must try! Food:Appetizer- Chicory Caesar (5/5) An upscale Caesar salad defined by a medley of flavors and textures!! It was shared amongst two people and was a great appetizer to have. Pasta- Handkerchief (5/5)A must when going to Pearl. I was at a loss of words when eating this pasta. The plate was completely clean when we had finished eating.\", 'Came here for my birthday and will be going back. The overall decor and ambiance makes you feel transported to a quaint French bistro. We all got different dishes and we all wanted to lick our plates after. The favorite of the night were the scallops. Our server was pleasant and helped us pick a bottle of wine after our cocktails.', \"Came here twice for dinner. Enjoyed it both times! Got the steak and handkerchief pasta this time. The steak dish had so many flavors - good combination. It could have been a little more tender on the outside but overall very good medium rare. The pasta was good as well (!), just not as unique. Finished off with panna cotta which was super light and tasty! Only thing is that it is quite echo-y inside so it's hard to hear what each other are saying. Outside might be better for conversation, might try tha next time.food - 5/5service - 4/5ambiance - 3.5/5 (very loud inside, though cute interior)value - 4/5 (good price for the quality and uniqueness of dishes)\", 'They have excellent food options and the food was well-cooked, nice portion. The place was wonderful and has nice seating. Welcoming vibe when we entered the places.The food was decent. Pretty amazing options. I had the Chicory Caesar salad taste fresh and nice flavor. The pasta was great. I also like the seared scallops, it was well-cooked. The drinks were great and perfect with my food. I had a nice experience there.', 'I came here last week after Config and I got the handkerchief pasta and it so good. The \"noodles\" were large rectangular pieces and it had grounded up meat with thin slices of Parmesan. I\\'ve never had pasta like this before but it was so savory and rich. Highly recommend.', 'I went with my friends to \"Pear Restaurant\", and from the beginning to the end the servers were friendly. It was full when we got there and kindly we were asked to wait for a table, while waiting we sat in the front patio next to nice tall heaters. Food, drinks, and desserts were top the shelf no only have a nice presentation but are full of flavor. Great restaurant in a nice corner of San Francisco.', \"Fantastic for dinner! We came here for my friend's birthday dinner, having made a reservation well in advance (100% necessary). We ended up getting caught in traffic on the way up, but we called and the restaurant was able to accommodate our lateness. Once we arrived, we were seated at a large table near the back. The space was relatively small but in a cozy and classic way - pretty casual vibes. Our server Jake came over right away and we started off with some drinks - I got an Aperol Spritz (too heavy on the Aperol/light on the Prosecco, but I still enjoyed it) and my friends got the Tidy Tips (very tasty) and Birds Eye (didn't try this one). We also got some starters to share - the Acme Bread & Butter, Chicken Liver Mousse (fantastic), Gulf Prawns (great seasoning but not a whole lot of prawn to eat), Oysters (phenomenal, so fresh), and Roasted Cauliflower (also great, totally exceeded my expectations). After this, it was time for pasta! I don't know why they don't advertise it anywhere, but Pearl can sub gluten free pasta into any of their pasta dishes. However, it's not even on their menu so I only knew this from the Yelp reviews. I got the gluten free Radiatori and my friends got the Spinach-Ricotta Gnudi, Spaghetti, and Seared Scallops. All the entrees were phenomenal, and I absolutely loved my pasta dish. Portion sizes were also perfect - I finished the entire dish and didn't feel overly full afterwards. We also got Espresso Martinis to finish off the meal, which were pretty good but had a bit too much foam. Overall though, I would LOVE to return!\", \"Best date spot since it's cozy with so much warmth and low lighting. Definitely will be coming back again.Service 5/5 our server came around multiple times to make sure we were enjoying our meal and to make sure our glasses were always filled. She was really kind too! Squid ink bucatini 5/5Hands down the best thing we had. The Calabrian gives it the perfect kick and the tuna was perfect for the flavors of the noodles.Prawns 5/5Second best dish since it has a lime flavor with a chili kick to it too. I think they may have used bird eye chilis. Oysters 5/5Pork chop 2/5Very underwhelming compared to everything else and didn't really have a flavor but more of just straight up meat alone. Steak 3/5Wouldn't get again but the medium rare steak was good. They were precut into five thick slices and dint have too much flavor to it too.CauliflowerWe had broccoli instead I think but it was the same toppings. Despite it being broccoli, it tasted good still\", \"My husband saw that they had a white Bolognese on the menu and immediately decided he wanted to dine here to celebrate his 40th birthday.  The atmosphere is pretty hip but also very chill.  They have some other nice food offerings too, and a particularly tasty wine menu.  It's in a quiet neighborhood and perhaps off your path but worth the drive over.  Oh, and I highly recommend reservations since the space is pretty small.\", \"The cutest little restaurant for a cozy hangout or date night! While there is indoor and outdoor seating, I'd recommend getting a reservation beforehand since it gets quite busy and parking can be hard to come by.The menu changes by seasons so some items may be switched around depending on when you go-- but I highly recommend any of the pastas.For drinks, we ordered the morning glory: 4/5 --sweet, fruity, refreshing!handkerchief pasta: 5/5 -- creamy, hearty pasta with plenty of cheese. The flavor profile was very balanced, not too salty or sickeningly heavyclam spaghetti: 5/5 -- my absolute favorite pasta dish!!! The sauce was heavenly; a bit of umami from the clams, sweetness from wine and butter, this pasta was truly the star of the show. I had to stop myself from ordering another one! Overall, I really like the ambiance of this restaurant and would recommend to anyone in the area who is looking for a cute, homey dining experience\", 'Came here for dinner on a Sunday and it was still pretty packed! Our server was super sweet and recommended a couple of their favorites. We ended up getting the steak tartare, the roasted cauliflower, and the sticky chocolate torte. The sauce that the cauliflower sits on was so good, it was super rich and nutty with a slight chili oil flavor. The steak tartare was also pretty good! I would def come here for small groups cause all their dishes are great for sharing!', \"An excellent meal with complex well-composed dishes that showed both solid execution and innovation.The cauliflower app is a must. So much going on there with the mole, almost, and sweet raisins. It's just a new set of flavors and textures to explore.The popular handkerchief pasta didn't disappoint. The pasta was perfectly fresh and chewy. The sauce was a nice balance of lightness and body.The torte I thought was just OK. It didn't have that intensity of flavor that was achieved in the savory dishes I had.\", 'Delicious! We started with oysters (perfect size) and a delicious house made hot sauce. We also got the Brandade fritters, came with 2 in the order. Yummy but small.For our main courses we got Handkerchief and the Pork Schnitzel, both delicious and bigger portions compared to other entrees.', \"This is my third dining at the Pearl 6101 restaurant (prior I came with friends).  Today we celebrated our daughter's advance birthday that I made the reservation almost 4 weeks in advance with indoor seating.  The restaurant got pretty busy.  When we sat down the music was loud but later I noticed it got adjusted.  We ordered the delicious French red wine 2018 Domaine Maestracci. We had snacks Brandade Fritters and the fresh & warm Acme bread with butter.  Actually our daughters ordered second of the bread as it was good.  For starter we ordered the roasted cauliflowers with hummus topped with roasted almonds that made it tasty.  We ordered our own main entrees like Handkerchief and Bucatini pastas, Sea Bass, Seared Scallops and Pork Chops.  Our dessert Buttermilk Panna Cotta came in with a birthday candle. We also had the Chocolate Pudding as dessert. Everyone agreed we had a scrumptious birthday dinner.  In the beginning the server (Alicia?) was waiting patiently as we were not decided what to drink and what to order.  I hope they fix where the outside sign is as the paint is peeling off on ceiling and post!  Anyhow there is no doubt in my mind that we shall return in the future!\", \"What a little gem!  An easygoing spot with a comfortable atmosphere.  Everyone was friendly, and food + service were great.  It's got lots of light and  a diverse yet concise menu -- everyone can find something that works here.  Roasted Cauliflower steak was a hit for all of us.  I ordered the scallops, which were a solid (though not life-changing) choice.  The next time I'm back, I'll get a pasta (we shared one and it was excellent)Came here for a business discussion and the ambiance/noise level works great for that purpose.\", \"Loved the hustle and bustle of this joint, and the food was a pleasant nostalgic mix of homestyle and modern dining. Layout kinda made me think about being in one of my friend's grandma's house from the south.Ordered the oysters cuz they prepare them with a cute little red dot. I'm usually a purist, but these were fun. However, please be careful when you slurp. The spicy tang from the sauce may induce wheezing.Also got the wood fired prawns plated on top of a beautiful green sauce and cauliflower drizzled in some kind of pesto crumble. Both were fun but neither were amazing. For example, the prawns were charred to perfection but were the same kind you can buy from any higher end market in SF. I've never found real fresh shrimp/prawns in SF, so if you find them please let me know where and thanks!Drinks were fun. I got a glass of wine which I was disappointed with, and my partner appreciated them making her a mezcal margarita off menu.Only real complaint was slow service. I couldn't blame the servers, who were great. The restaurant was just understaffed.All in all good times. I might come back like every other year.\", \"Remarkable Service! Great ambiance and remarkable food! We ordered the Chicken Liver Mousse toast, an excellent appetizer!  Perfection! Then we had the Fried Brussel Sprouts. An excellent and interesting combination with roasted grapes and walnut purée. Of course we ordered the Acme bread...which was different from other restaurants' Acme bread...this one was curated for Pearl. We had the Handkerchief Pasta with white Bolognese Sauce...unique and luscious. Lastly we wanted the Seared Scallops but it was not available that night but instead was offered the Roast Pork Belly which turned out to be a great choice. It could have been a five star restaurant if it had a wider choice for the customers to choose. May consider coming back...\", 'This restaurant is my go to place to eat with friends and family. I love the outdoor area, it is so European.The menu is easy to navigate. the food is fresh and yummy.Will keep coming to Pearl.', 'It on our rotation.  Very pleasant and relaxed outside.  Space heaters were working.  The food is always good.  The crudo, which changes seasonally, is a must.', 'One of my favorite hidden gems in SF! The pasta are mouth-watering, service is attentive & friendly, and ambiance is casual romantic. We sat outside and they had plenty of heat warms to keep us toasty in February! Note: the max number of people they will seat is 4 ppl. Would highly recommend!', 'Thursday night and the restaurant was bustling.  Reasonably priced for SF and a good selection of choices. Food was delicious but chefs may have a heavier hand of salt than usual. However, the staff could use a bit of training:1. Cocktail was forgotten until I asked someone (not my own server) to follow up and the response was : I don\\'t know what you ordered! Hmm, couldn\\'t he check it with the system? Cocktail finally arrived in the middle of main course2. I was very insistent on no chilli, not even on the side, for the appetizer, but apparently one of the mains has \"tons\" of chilli and it wasn\\'t even listed on the menu! Why didn\\'t the server say anything? We couldn\\'t eat it at all3. When we left, you have to pass by the front desk, even though she saw us coming, there was no \"goodbye\" \"thank you\" nothing! Will I go back? Probably not. There are so many restaurants in sf, I don\\'t think I need to make a trip out here for subpar service.', 'This meal did not miss. Went here on a Friday with friends and scored a 5:30pm indoor reservation day of, luckily. The inside is very cute and airy, sort of like a European cafe. Service was lovely and prompt as well. We decided to do family style and loved it. To start, we got the acme bread - warm soft with a lovely crust, oysters - fresh with unique and delightful flavors on top, and tartare - a generous portion with excellent contrasting flavor from the pickled onions and frisée. To share for the mains, we got the sole, steak, spaghetti, and handkerchief pasta. Everything was perfect. I really liked how the seafood spaghetti had a good flavor and nice coating of sauce, usually I find that seafood pasta has a more watery sauce that doesn\\'t stick as well, but this one was great! The handkerchief pasta was delicious and rich, some of my friends mentioned it reminded them (nostalgically) of \"the best hamburger helper\" and were raving about how homey it tasted. I thought it was delicious too. The fish was delicious and well-cooked and the steak had a wonderful almost molé-like sauce that my friends also loved. As for drinks, we had cocktails and wine. I enjoyed all of the cocktails I was able to try (3 of them). All around, a solid spot with not a single thing on the menu I didn\\'t like.', \"Came here with some friends and it lived up to the hype. I highly recommend making a reservation because it is very popular. There is eating inside and outside of the restaurant. My friends and I shared pastas and the caesar salad. The caesar salad is probably the best I've ever had. Can't wait to take others here! Beautiful decor and ambiance.\", 'The pasta had an amazing sauce. The scallops were seared to a lovely crisp. Greatly enjoyed these dishes!', \"Great experience overall.There seems to be a common theme among these mid-high tier trendy restaurants in SF--appetizers are better than the entrees.Oysters were super fresh and the dill was fantastic addition. Caesar salad was fire (very generous amount of parmesan shavings).  The handkerchief pasta was good but wish it came with some lemon or something cause it need some acid. The Sea Bass had very unique flavors especially with the sautéed minced olives sauce (had cardamom/star anise spices?). It didn't feel as cohesive as it could be but still good and unique.Good service but overall, the ambience and appetizers are probably what shined most for me.\"]\n",

When we arrived, the restaurant was mostly empty, but by the time we left an hour later, it was completely packed! We loved the ambience of the restaurant. It seems like there was a lot of thought put into all the details from the wall mural, to ceiling fixtures, to the utensil holders, to the various cups for each drink.Service was very friendly and attentive. The chef even stopped by to check in on our meal and talk about his thought process behind some of the dishes!Everything was very tasty, but the standouts were the braised oxtail and the tapioca dessert. We will definitely be back to try their a la carte menu!', \"Fantastic service at nice location that see the cooking in action. Love the lunch special menu and the options that are offered. The drinks are tasty. The appetizers aren't too heavy where you still have room for your main dish. I tried the spring rolls and they were crispy and still moist inside. You will not go hungry with your main dish. Loved the fired garlic in the garlic noodles, and the chicken is nicely grilled. The banh mi sandwiches are massive and filled to the brim. Definitely try this restaurant.\", \"It felt more like a sampling menu. $65pp for the set dinner but there isn't a whole lot of food. I understand when you come to a place like this, it's more about the trendy bar Asian fusion vibe. Everything was good from the beef carpaccio to the duck spring rolls to the fried catfish. I really enjoyed the pho spice cocktail!! And coffee cream brûlée was a delicious treat at the end. It does get really loud here due to the layout of the restaurant. You've also got the open kitchen right there to add to the mix. They're very popular so by 6:30, it's really crowded. If you come early, you shouldn't have a problem getting seated. Dishes take a little while to come out but service was quite friendly, as expected at places like this. I think I prefer more cozy places so there's a certain vibe you'd be looking for when you come to Lily's. I don't think I quite got my money's worth, hence 3 stars overall\", 'Delicious food! I had been waiting to check this place out. Came with some friends on a Sunday, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. We ordered the garlic noodles with steak, duck egg rolls, and mussels in curry sauce with ramen noodles. All three dishes were super tasty. The beef in the garlic noodles was cooked perfectly, melting in your mouth. The duck egg rolls were very tender with the crispy outside perfectly complimenting the stuffing. The mussels were good too, but a bit difficult to eat as a shared dish. I also got a side of their hot sauce which comes in a little jar that I was able to take home. The restaurant has a really nice decor and ambience, and we sat at the chefs table where we could see them make the meal. Highly recommend this place!', \"We came here on a Sunday night for dinner with no reservations but were able to get table seating. We ordered two appetizers and garlic noodles, but the appetizers were huge. For two people, we were both pretty content after the appetizers. We ordered:*beef carpaccio: also came with bone marrow and a large sesame cracker. This dish was so flavorful. *bo luc lac salad*garlic noodles with surf and turf: it was the same filet mignon as the bo luc lac salad. We took it to go as we couldn't finish it after the first two dishes.For drinks, we tried the strawberry daquiri and preserved lime blended margarita. The strawberry daquiri just tasted like a strawberry yogurt. The margarita was very salted plum forward. Will definitely be back to try other menu items.\", \"The first picture Yelp shows of Lily is its door. What a pretty door! It's a medium sized restaurant, and the seating is parallel to its bar/kitchen. The chef's dog, Bo, stands guard at the front of the restaurant and very relaxed and polite-- what a good boy.They take reservations via Resy, but they had plenty of empty tables when I dined on a Sunday lunch. The interior climate of the restaurant was damp as the ventilation was poor, with some moist and muggy pockets of air hitting you every so often. Service was decent, and the food came out pretty quickly.I tried the lunch set menu which includes a beverage, appetizer, and entree. What saddens me about Lily is that it aims to be elevated Vietnamese food, which comes with the glitz and the price tag, but the flavor? For every item that came to our table, we'd have the same descriptor: mild. It tasted like the essence of a dish rather than an actual dish. The only strong item was the Vietnamese Iced Coffee.\", \"We came in on a Sunday night without reservations, not knowing it was restaurant week, and had less than 15 min wait. The RW menu was $65, and was great selection and value for a special occasion For the first course, we tried the beef carpaccio, pho, and the duck rolls. The highlight of the three was the beef carpaccio, which had incredible balance of flavor in the light marinade/dressing, with an umami boost of fish sauce and much needed citrus to cut the fat from the bone marrow on the side. The sesame crackers offer great texture contrast. The other two dishes had great attention to flavor balance as well, just less extreme flavor rangeFor the second course, we tried the Hanoi bbq pork, turmeric fried catfish, and I believe an oxtail dish. The bbq pork and catfish dishes came with lots of Banh Hoi type materials, like lettuce, herbs, dipping sauces. They also came with rice paper, and I think our server recommended we just fold the food into them and dip before eating - I'm not sure that this is recommended, I think more typical may be to moisten the whole rice paper sheet before filling. People can eat it however they want, but offering some instruction either from staff or on the menu could be helpful here, since dealing with the rice paper isn't intuitive to all. I think moistening the rice paper entirely has a more pleasant texture. The Banh Hoi woven vermicelli noodles themselves are a marvel, cut to be just the right size for the rice paper, with a nice smoky garlic flavor, and satisfying springy texture. The catfish was spectacular, arrived sizzling and lightly crispy, and had a nice bed of fried onions to catch residual flavor.The banana pudding was excellent, with nice moist texture, and great temperature contrast with the ice cream. The tapioca pudding has a lot going on, but had a nice flavor balance.\", 'Loved santel our service provider who was warm and went above and beyond to make sure we understood the menu from start to finish. So for that we will def be coming back.The bone marrow was exceptional.  All the flavors harmonized and the herbs really made this dish sang.  Highly recommend. Bun rieu was very creative and had luscious flavors.  Though being Vietnamese I still felt it could use more tomato flavorPork chop was very high quality and was a generous portion. Something I always appreciate.  Will be back for many reasons but perhaps it was the service that made the experience memorable', 'Went here for SF Restaurant Week with two other friends! I was scouring the reservation website for a good two days straight and was able to get a table reservation at prime time 6pm dinner! It was $65 per person and I left full! The appetizer of beef and bone marrow was delish!!! Highly recommend! The coffee crème brûlée was extraordinary as well!!', 'Amazing place located in the multiethnic area of Richmond. Beautifully decorated space with elevated Vietnamese dishes. We tried the lunch special which included a special drink, appetizer/salad, and main dish. Generous portions!  The dishes are freshly prepared and dressed.  I especially loved the the chow fun noodles with tofu! Highly recommend this place if you are in SF', 'I\\'ve always been a little cautious about creative Asian cuisine but this place is brilliant. The decor was very cute with an open kitchen where you can watch the cooks working on the grill and wok. We loved everything we ordered but in particular the Jackfruit Pizza. The presentation was beautiful! Toppings include sweet jackfruit, microgreens, edible flowers, and some herby, tangy, creamy sauce. The rice paper was super crunchy and fun to eat. Highly recommend! We also liked the mango chicken salad. It came with plenty of mango chunks, chicken pieces, and avocado. The dressing was tangy and spicy. The rice paper mixed in added some fun texture. It\\'s totally a dish I\\'d like to eat every day. The chow fun came with rolled rice noodles, fried tofu, and a variety of veggies. The tofu was the star of the show to me, crispy on the outside, custardy on the inside. The dressing on the side had a pretty strong mustardy/wasabi taste. Last thing we had was the Pork Meatball \"Xiu Mai\". The concept of a deconstructed banh mi was interesting. And the presentation of meatballs simmered in tomato sauce, two gorgeously buttered milk bread, and a scoop of pate was also appealing. Very rich meaty flavors and generous portions. The mains are on the pricier side and come in larger servings so good to share among a few people. However, IMO their appetizers are definitely the best part of the menu.', 'I came here for restaurant week because the fixed menu looked really good. I got the Vietnamese coffee, beef noodle soup, and roast beef sandwich with soup dip. The Vietnamese coffee had a strong flavor which I like. Beef noodle soup had zero flavor at all. It was strange because it smelled really nice though. It threw me off.After that soup I knew I was going to regret my entree dish . The soup dip was the same flavorless soup, but the sandwich was good on its own.$40 pp for the meal was kind of disappointing. The service was great though and reservations were easy.', \"Came here for restaurant week!So Sunday mornings/afternoon is when inner Richmond farmers market takes place so it was impossible to park! Would just bus or Uber honestly bc we spent 20 mins finding parking and another 15 to walk. Wish they had let us known ahead but oh well! Prefix was 30 pp but our entrees were +5 each Got the prefix menu for restaurant week which lets u choose btw drink, app, entree Saigon ice: 3/5 the yuzu was settled in the bottom so make sure to mix well!Strawberry sin toh: 2/5 tastes like the children strawberry yogurt drink (danimals) hahaCalamari: 3.5/5 this was ok! Appreciated the fish sauce/Asian flavors but maybe a bit bland bc lack of enough sauce Chicken noodle soup: 4/5 this was a miniature pho dish basically and broth was pretty good with taste of chicken stock Broken rice: 5/5 generous portion and all the individual pieces tasted really good. The broth this dish came out in was the best bc it had a beef stock taste with rich flavors Pho dip: 3/5 wasn't my favorite a lot of meat and pate but maybe wasn't as spicy as I had hoped to balance those flavors. Also the dip thing maybe wasn't too much of a fan of but can see why others may like! Overall we paid around 46 after tax and tip which I think was a bit pricey but still had pretty generous portion sizes. Not sure if I may visit again but if I do excited to explore the dinner menu!\", \"Our family had a wonderful experience having an early lunch at Lily this weekend. Ambiance - the space was gorgeous and clean. You know what you are getting into going to Clement Street on a Saturday morning, but found a metered parking spot right in front. Lots of metered parking within 1 block, and some unmetered parking further out. Food - really great, beautiful, and nice takes on familiar and traditional dishes. I am partial, but Vietnamese food is pretty but Lily makes them gorgeous with flowers, garnishes, and other 'tweezer-work'. I also loved the banh mi, wings, an bun cha. Service - really deserves 6 stars. Extremely attentive, water glasses filled, clean plates and utensils changed between courses, etc. Front of house staff went out of their way to make our family feel welcome. I want to bring more people back here now! We'll be back.\", \"Lily is a great place to go to if you're looking for delicious, upscale Vietnamese food. I was able to go during Restaurant week and get the $30 deal which included an appetizer, drink, and main course. Overall felt like it was a pretty good deal especially for SF, and we'll definitely be back to try different things on the menu.Food wise: For appetizers, we got the calamari and ginger chicken soup. The calamari was spectacular and the chicken soup even better, perfectly balanced flavors! For drinks, we got the strawberry and lime sinh to, both of which were super tart and flavor-filled. I don't know that we'd get them again if we came, but as part of the deal they were great! The only thing I wasn't completely satisfied with was the Garlic Noodles - to be fair I do feel like my garlic tolerance level is extremely high (as in I consistently quadruple the amount of garlic needed for a recipe when cooking) - and I felt that there could've been a stronger garlic flavor. However, the dish was still tasty. My partner got one of the plates that cost an extra $5 (can't remember what it was called) and it came with a variety of grilled meats and rice. He enjoyed that immensely! The service was good - it's definitely a busy and crowded restaurant and I did see a lot of dishes getting delivered to the wrong tables. We were also seated about 15 min after our reservation time, but I think that can be attributed to the business of restaurant week.\", \"We were walking around and exploring the neighborhood and passed by Lily's. Menu looked good so we decided to come back for dinner when it opened. Dinner turned out to be fantastic! We ordered the Bun Cha Hanoi, Com Tam Suon Nuong and Cafe Sua Pot de Creme. And wow, it was a lot of food. The portions are, as other reviewers note, rather hefty. Mind you, the menu prices are a bit steeper than I'd expect but each dish was delicious and beautifully presented. For what we ordered we could easily have fed another person so either come very hungry, come as a group, or don't over order like we did. That said, everything was delicious and I highly recommend it!\", \"Very beautiful interior. Drinks are served with gorgeous flowers.Service was great, we were a party of 6 + my baby nephew and felt super comfortable.Food was yummy but not extraordinary, also very expensive for what it is. Glad we came, probably won't go back. So many other local gems to check out.\", 'We ordered a lot of food. Each plate portion is way bigger than we anticipated. We thought this was one of those schmuck tapas places but NOPE the portions are pretty hefty. Come come. Get catfish. So good. Comes with stuff. Oh wait my burger king is ready I gtg.  Edit: I got covid. 2/27/23. Which one of you went here to eat dinner and gave me covid that night?', \"A new favorite in the city! First and foremost, service is amazing. From the front staff to waiters and bartenders, everyone is so friendly and attentive. Chef Rob Lam was present that night. He checked in with all the guests and ensured that everyone was having a good time. There is a diverse selection of dishes and a decently sized selection of non-alcoholic drinks too! That night we opted for the spicy glazed chicken wings, fried prawns and sweet potato, and Hanoi BBQ Heritage pork. We also had the Vietnamese iced coffee and lychee strawberry sinh to. Every item was an explosion of rich flavor. If you're craving for Vietnamese and open to a unique and elevated experience, Lily is the place.\", \"Lily on Clement StreetInner RichmondSan Francisco, California Chef Rob Lam's warm effervescent personality pushed this one to a 5 star for me. His presence and desire to create a delicious and pleasing environment, could be felt throughout. I love it when a Chef will take the time to stop by and visit to chat about the food! Happy workers make happy servers in this upscale Vietnamese establishment and you're invited to join the party. It's rare to find a fancy Vietnamese place! Most of us are used to the usual pho and summer roll restaurants. Ever had jackfruit on pizza with nasturtiums or thick sliced Berkshire pork chops served with broken rice plus a pork hash casserole with egg or coconut charcoal infused truffle crepes? I have now!Beautifully presented food in a lively atmosphere. Expect to be pleasantly surprised. Large portions and a long list of alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks. Get the Pots de Creme for dessert! Double yum!Street parking available.\", \"I usually wouldn't pay Lily prices for a regular Vietnamese restaurant, but this was no regular restaurant. We went during restaurant week to try and honestly it might be one of my favourite restaurants in the city, food wise.The banana pudding might've been the best dessert we've had in a long time, but the cauliflower curry could've been better. I really liked the cauliflower curry personally, but my partner found it to be lacking in flavour. the chow fun was really good. There were people next to us eating the beef carpaccio, and it looked spectacular. The vibe definitely has Asian influences and the bar seating was really awesome because we were able to watch all the chefs make the food. One of the managers (maybe owner) came and dropped off food, and chatted with us, and it felt really personable.\", \"Behind a very unassuming entry is this amazing modern Vietnamese eatery with super tasty food!  Very creative menu - most items on it we haven't seen anywhere else!  We started with the Jackfruit pizza - no thick dough here, more like think chips at the bottom, and we're delighted with the interesting taste. The second appetizer we had was the steak salad - good size bowl with chunks of tender beef; very delicious. Our main course was the BBQ pork chop - huge dish with a lot of meat- the three of us couldn't finish even half of it. Our last course was the garlic noodles , again, big portion size here again. Service was attentive and on point; owner/chef Robert was busy working as well as socializing with customers.  And they packaged all the food we couldn't finish carefully and thoughtfully for us in individual paper containers. While most of the dishes were between $30-60, I think the value is great because they give you a lot of food!  And that, combined with the quality and taste, make them an impeccable 5-Star restaurant in my book!\", 'What a wonderful way to celebrate a birthday! Not only was the food unreal, the staff was professional and personable--chef Robert Lam himself came out to say hi with his cute puppy. The overall mood of the restaurant had the right balance of formality and home which is exactly my vibe. It was such an amazing experience and my husband and I are happy to think of this restaurant as a new addition to our list of SF favorites. Lily is another reason why we love our city.', 'I made a reservation for a party of 6 a few months in advance for brunch on a Saturday. The online reservation system was easy to use and seamless. On the day of our brunch, we were running a little late and they were able to accommodate a reservation at 12:00 PM rather than 11:30 AM which was nice. (Note: They open at 11:00 AM). The place did not get busy until 1-1:30 PM, so if you do plan on having a later brunch, do make a reservation. Each of us ordered from the prix fixe brunch menu which was a base price of $35/person. The prix fixe menu allows you to choose a drink, appetizer, and an entree. However, there are supplemental and add-ons which can easily hike the price of $35/person closer to $50-$60/person before tax. I got the coconut smoothie and added a shot of rum ($5 added for the coconut smoothie and an additional $7 to add alcohol to any drink), fried calamari, and the broken rice fish (com tam). My husband got the Saigon tea, papaya mango salad, and the BBQ heritage bowl. Coconut sinh to (3/5) - The presentation for this drink was great as it reminded me of Hawaii, but the drink itself was not remarkable. It tasted like bland coconut milk rather than a piña colada smoothie. Saigon tea (3/5) - We were hoping the yuzu flavor in the tea would pull through, but the drink was a bit too floral for our tasting. A plus about this drink is it\\'s not sweet, but do make sure to mix your drink thoroughly before drinking it or it gets syrupy on the bottom. Fried calamari (4/5) - Out of the 3 choices for appetizers on the menu, this was most likely the best choice. The calamari was lightly fried with some peppers. An aioli was drizzled on top of it. It was great, but just also a bit on the bland side even with the aioli topped on. Papaya mango salad (1/5) - We get that aesthetics are key in making and plating dishes, but this salad just had too many edible flowers and veered too far from what a salad should be. The papaya and mango are thinly sliced into thick 0.5\" strips rather than in matchsticks. Everyone in our party who ordered this dish ate around the flowers and was left with half a plate of flowers. The flowers were simply too overwhelming. The pomegranate was a nice touch, but again everything was buried in flowers making it hard to truly enjoy. Com tam (3/5) - The broken rice fish came with a great selection of protein from shrimp to chicken to pork. It also had a sunny side up fried egg present. Having some fish sauce on the side would be nice, but the protein for this dish was overly salty. Items were cooked well, but the flavoring was not to our palette. BBQ bowl (3/5) - This dish had banh hoi (rice noodles) and grilled pork. Pork was fine, but nothing surprised us about the dish. All in all, we felt this was on the pricey side, but of course it\\'s in SF so we knew right off the bat that we would be paying more. Presentation for the food was well executed, but the flavors were hard to follow through. We are glad we tried Lily restaurant. The service was amazing and our server was very approachable.', 'Came to try their $30 restaurant week lunch menu, made a 1:30 pm restaurant and was finally seated around 1:50pm. They were VERY busy but we seemed to be the only party that had to stand around and wait for a table to open up. Kind of left a bad taste in the mouth.The food was decently good! The strawberry sinh to was a nice creamy smoothie that satisfied my sweet cravings. My table tried all the appetizers, and I would pass on the salad. The pho and calamari were good though! For my entree I got the cha ca la vong fish noodle bowl and I really liked it. The fish was perfectly crispy and they really loaded the bowl with a LOT of fish. Overall, $30 restaurant week deal was well worth it for the yummy food and the huge portion sizes.', \"The Vietnamese cuisine served at Lily is contemporary and unique. We chose 3 appetizers and the day's special. Our server was friendly and enthusiastic, though I wish he'd warned us how generous the portions were. I think we would have been fine with two appetizers. What we ordered:- beef carpaccio - fried prawns and sweet potato - shaking filet of beef salad- pâté chaudThe beef carpaccio was a westernized version of traditional bo tai chanh. It was good, though our marrow bone didn't have much marrow in it.The fried prawns and sweet potato were a deconstructed version of banh tom co ngu. I liked how the prawns were fried out super crispy with the heads included. It was well seasoned and very good.The shaking beef salad was also a twist on bo luc lac. It was my husband's favorite dish that evening.The pate chaud was a puff pastry filled with duck and chicken liver pate, instead of ground pork. A unique take, though very rich. The ambiance is chic and trendy and it was bustling. We could tell that Lily is a very popular restaurant. FYI, though the food served is very good, it's much heavier than traditional Vietnamese cuisine and the the appetizers are entree-sized.\", \"Went to Lily for their SF Restaurant Week Lunch! We were able to get seated without reservation pretty quickly, but we did get there close to closing.I ordered the saigon iced tea, salt & pepper calamari, and cha ca la vong fish noodle bowl off their prix fixe menu.I felt like iced tea was pretty light, but still refreshing. The calamari was good, but not that memorable. The texture was more soft than crispy, like I usually expect. The noodle bowl was my favorite; the fish was really well cooked and was super flaky and the sauce was good. I also tried my friend's ginger chicken noodle soup and I thought the broth was really rich and flavorful.Lily offered a really interesting/modern twist to the Viet cuisine/restaurants I'm used to. It was honestly too nice compared to the Viet restaurants I frequent, so it was nice to try a different take!\", \"You'll need to make reservations for Lily online using their reservation booking website. There's option for table or bar. Restaurant is long and has fairly good seating, lots of reservation options the day or two prior to going but the table option filled up quickly! Came on MLK day and had the best time talking to the staff while waiting. Didn't catch the name but he was very funny/charismatic. Our waiter was very nice as well. Most staff that we spoke to was very nice. We ordered the jackfruit pizza appetizer and it was delicious. It was sweet a little sweet! It came with a scissor to cut pieces of the pizza. Lots of different but delicious looking appetizers to choose from! It was hard to just get one. Drinks: my friend ordered the Rodriguez Farms strawberry sinh toI had the kiwi cucumber crush. I must say it was a bit too sour for my taste  and wish I got a sweeter drink. For dinner my friends got:Garlic noodles with added chicken - very delicious, you can't go wrong with garlic noodles. Wok seared vegetarian chow fun - despite being my friends choice, I'd say this was actually my favorite dish of the night. Super flavorful, the tofu was delicious I couldn't get enough! When I took my first bite my eyes lit up with pleasant surprise and I secretly wished I ordered this one. I got the 2nd place beef noodle soup -pho Bo- despite it being 2nd place it was sooooo good. Very flavorful, the broth had a cinnamon taste that came out more than I've ever had in other pho. I like the added bread to dip in the soup and even had leftovers which taste just as good!\"]\n",

      "Reviews: ['Make a reservation before you attempt to come here. I live in the neighborhood and tried without one unsuccessfully. The hostess quoted us \"15min\" for a party of two to be seated, but we waited there for almost 45m before giving up.', \"The food, sake, and service were exceptional. I can't wait to come back and try more dishes. The salmon curry was unique and delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly.\", \"This place is such a hidden gem!  I've been here few times and was satisfied every time i went.  The place itself is simple and casual with a touch of elegance.  It was very cozy and perfect for friends gathering or even a date night.  Service was welcoming from start to finish.  They know their menu pretty well and gave good recommendations.

It was sweat and sour with a little bit spice.  Very refreshing. Bibimbap (3/5)This dish was ok, a bit blend. I would recommend making a reservation just in case.\", \"Glad I got to try this place but I won't be back. I made reservations for 6:30 and got here a few minutes early. Parking was not the greatest but that was expected. We parked 3 blocks away.The restaurant was pretty empty upon arrival and stayed that way until the end of the meal. Together we ordered:Hamachi Kama 3/5: standard. I really liked the sauce that it came with. Thai braised chicken: 2/5 nothing special. Had a side of wonton noodles in a sauce that I didn't not enjoy. Cold spicy noodles with pork jowl: 2/5 flavors were great a few bites in but I was really struggling to finish it.\", \"Kothai, the Korean and Thai fusion gem, not only impressed with its unique and delicious dishes but also stands out for providing one of the best service experiences I've encountered. The waiter went above and beyond by keeping us updated on wait times, setting the tone for a positive dining experience.The menu at Kothai showcases creativity with unique and flavorful dishes. The creative appetizers add an exciting dimension to the meal, and personally, the noodle dishes became a clear favorite.Adding to the overall appeal, the environment at Kothai is super aesthetic, making it an excellent choice for a great date spot. The thoughtful combination of delightful dishes, exceptional service, and a visually appealing setting makes Kothai a standout fusion restaurant.In summary, Kothai is a must-visit for those seeking a fusion of Korean and Thai flavors. With top-notch service, creative dishes, and a charming environment, it creates an ideal setting for a memorable dining experience.\", \"New, Korean Thai fusion restaurant that lives up to its name. Wasn't too busy and the restaurant was kind of quiet on a Sunday 2pm lunch time. Service was quick to seat and refill water.5/5 Crispy Grilled Hamachi Collar was super fresh and came with a crunchy green chili basil crumb underneath that pairs well with the white, less seasoned parts of the fish. The dish would've been perfect with a scoop of white rice to soak up the crispy , not too oily bits of fish skin. 4/5 Thai Braised Chicken was solid, the meat was juicy and tender to fork off the bone. I liked how it came with mushroom but was surprised the sauce to pour over it wasn't salty or as umami.Luckily, I asked for their condiment rack and the green chili vingarette sauce was the perfect combo with the chicken. The spice one was alright, both were freshly made in house.Would come back with a larger group to try different items!\", \"Delicious, spicy flavors exploding in your mouth! The Tom yum noodle wasn't too spicy but still had a Thai kick and lemongrass flavor. I'd definitely order the Tom yum again and the mushroom, bean sprout, egg, and not over cooked king shrimps (2) were delish. We mostly tried the Thai side of the menu,but it is a Thai Korean fusion place. The mushroom plate had a unique flavor dip and crunch with the leaves which had an acid taste too. The chocolate mousse was rich but not heavy. The berry compote was a nice addition to it too. We also enjoyed the crudo with smoked flavor and squid texture plus mango sauce with a kick. Also amazing. The vibe: clean, modern look on the corner of Judah and 9th. Clear glass windows and inside heaters with pretty wreaths. Hope it stays here for a while and will be in our rotation of places to come again to. We walked in at 7pm on a Saturday night and there was no wait. There was a table or two open !\", \"20/10! So thankful I stumbled across this TikTok video to try Kothai. I was a bit skeptical to try since Bangsang (another Korean fusion restaurant) was super disappointing but I cannot say enough great things about this place! Besides the food being absolutely amazing, the service was what stood out the most. Every single person in there was so sweet, attentive, and food came out pretty quick!We had the Hamachi Kama, Kalbi, Iron steak, Ceviche, and both noodle soups. The ceviche, Kalbi, and Tom yum noodle soup is a MUST TRY! I'd love to come back\", \"Sep 2023Solid. New place to try at the end of the trip. The decor is nice and simple, and the curtains were lowered so the sun didn't beat down on us. The service was friendly, and helpful with any questions we had. Check ins and water refills were frequent.We had gotten the kimchi rice balls to split. Compatriots ordered the Tom Yum and the Beef noodle soup. I got the bibimbap vegan with egg. The flavor fusions worked well flavorwise. The broths for both soups were rich and the balance of ingredients worked well. The Kimchi rice balls were a good opener with the sauce bringing a nice richness to it. I didn't lick the plate but I was close. The bibimbap was plated very well and presentation was really nice. The sauce brought things together tho it was a bit fresh for me. I'd want a bit of salt even without the sauce, and something savory to tie it.All in all definitely a good stop. I'd be interested to try other things on the menu next time.\", \"I came here with a group of friends before Outside Lands, as we wanted to get some food at a Thai place that was not too far from it. While the inside isn't the largest, we were able to get a table to seat the party of 10 or so that we had. The service was good and while our food did take some time, I think that's mainly due to the larger size of our party. I ordered the Tomyum noodle soup and the kimchi rice balls. The portion size for the noodle soup is substantial, and I think for the price it's pretty worth. The flavors were good for the tomyum and the meat inside it were also cooked well. The Kimchi rice balls were pretty interesting, as the outside was quite crispy with the kimchi stuffed within. I think this is worth getting as an appetizer, and it's a good one to share with a couple others! Overall, it's a nice restaurant and would recommend trying it out!\", 'No Fees', \"Celebrated a friend's birthday and we decided to share everything family style.Bibimbap 7/10 pretty good but no wow factor! Def a fusion take though because of the carrots and coleslaw but taste wise wasn't too bad! We didn't try it with the peanut sauce so not sure if that would have been better or notSpicy cold noodles: 6/10 personally a little spicy for me! I also think that the pork jowl sauce didn't pair too well with the spicy noodles and the fact that the meat was warm while the noodles were cold was throwing me off a bit. But they were good if you ate them separately! I started eating the pork jowl with the veggies from the galbi dish instead and it was really good (also dipped it with ssamjang and the aioli sauce from the fried rice balls, bomb)Kimchi Fried rice balls: 9/10 i was pleasantly surprised!! It looks unassuming but it was actually pretty yummy and the aioli sauce was so good. It was the underdog of the night I recommend trying it. Galbi: 10/10 the meat was so tender, perfectly cooked, and was so enjoyable to eat wrapped in the veggies provided. A solid dish and a must get if you are sharing with your table. We shared among 6 people, but 4/6 were not so hungry. Portion size for the bibimbap would probably be like 2-3, the galbi is probably good for like 4 people to share. Ambience was nice and staff were all super friendly and on top of filling our waters!\", 'Service: 5Presentation: 5Ambiance: 5Noise level: 5Flavors: 5+Prices: 4 (but in all honesty everything is expensive nowadays)', \"Made a reservation with a small group and got seated immediately. Most people in my group don't eat spicy so they made sure to lower the spice level to mild for all our entrees. Ordered: Kimchi Rice BallsBossam Tom Yum Beef Noodle SoupLoved the bossam and kimchi rice balls. Of the two noodle soups, I would choose the Tom Yum over the Beef Noodle. The beef noodle had a very medicinal broth which we were not expecting. The menu isn't too extensive so if you're looking for a lot of options this might not be the restaurant for you.\", \"O V E R A L LMy friend introduced me to this restaurant and I immediately brought it back to my family/friends and I returned less than a month of my first visit. This place is such a hidden gem... I was so happy to have discovered this before it blew up. However, this place deserves all the business and hype!! I probably tried all the items on their menu at the time at this point.O R D E R(This is a late review so prices are older)Korean Spicy Noodle ($21) --- 10/5 Don't even think about it, just order it. I had this same dish twice and enjoyed this with 4 different people and everyone said this was part of their top fav orders. Kimchi Rice Balls 2 ($12) --- 4/5 This was really good but I think a bit more simple --- but done well. The sauce was amazing though! Tom Yum ($23) --- 5/5 Loved it!! It is a different take on it but it was still incredible.Beef Noodle Soup ($22) --- 4/5 This didn't taste like Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup, but it was a different take of it... still very good!Korean BBQ Skirt ($28) --- 4/5 This is where I give bonus points to the chef -- he came out and said he realized the first fix was not enough (not 8oz as listed -- and we noticed that as well)... and offered us a lot more to make up for it. Thank you for being so attentive in fixing this without us asking for it! Bibimbap ($22) --- I wasn't the one who ordered this because I normally don't go for Bibimbap, but I was told this was really good!Grilled Hamachi Collar ($20) --- 5/5 I ordered this in my first visit - not pictured here... and it was so bomb!!! This literally melted in my mouth and the pairing with the broccolini was just.... Amazing.S E R V I C EAs I mentioned prior, props to Chef for coming out and fixing a mistake without us mentioning it. O T H E RParking here is A PAIN. Absolute pain both times. Plan ahead... I believe we took over 30min trying to find parking. The inside is super cute and clean and it's on the corner so you can also people watch if seated in front of the windows.\", \"Arrived for my reservation to this Korean-Thai fusion restaurant and was seated right away. I heard great things about this restaurant so I was really excited. The service here was excellent as they change out your plate and silverware  after every dish. The menu was really small l, but there was some interesting dishes that I wanted to try.Kimchi Rice Balls (5/5): This dish is a kimchi fried rice ball that is deep fried. It comes with bacon inside and layer on a bed of aioli. The dish was fried to perfection and balanced well with its crunchiness and the softness of the kimchi fried rice. It was a bit spicy, but not too spicy. I thought the aioli was kewpie mayo and tasted very similar, but I enjoyed the very generous amount of it.Korean Spicy Noodle (5/5): This was my favorite dish of the night. This cold noodle dish is refreshing and a bit spicy at the same time. We got the pork jowl option and there was a generous amount of pieces. The pork jowl just melted in your mouth like heaven.Tom yum soup (5/5):  Beware, this dish is spicy. This Thai staple was filled it ingredients like crispy pork belly, mushrooms, a soft-boiled egg, and noodles. The broth was very spicy and sweet. I really like the add-ons, especially the crispy pork belly.I really enjoyed my experience here and had one of the best dinners I've had in a while.\", 'Ordered 3 entree dishes. The beef soup was amazing. Also ordered the roasted chicken, chicken was amazing, I think the dish could have used more noodles tbh. The last dish was the king salmon, the chef cooks it medium rare which was good but neither of us were into the curry so much....nice place nice service', 'Korean thai fusion place. Came on a Sunday upon opening and they were not busy at all. Servers were attentive and fast with giving us our orders.Everything we ordered was so delicious. Appetizers include the chicken toast and crying tiger skirt steak - which was like a lettuce wrap. I also loved their tom yum, but my other friends who tried it claimed that it was too \"shrimpy.\" - just fyi for those not a big fan of a seafood taste.Thai braised chicken was delicious too!Loved the glass walls that gave the restaurant a vibrant look!!', \"Fusion food is great in SF, where diversity reigns and cultures blend.  However, it takes high concept to make it work.  This place seems to have put a lot of thought into their menu and cozy restaurant.  KoThai Republic is a spicy combination of Korean and Thai foods along with sake and other alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks.  We had Kimchi Rice balls - crunchy, flavorful and slathered with mayo; KoThai Ceviche is a burst of lime, shrimp, peppers on crispy lettuce leaves - this IS spicy!  The salmon yellow Thai curry with rice made me sweat.  Glad we had the Apple crumble cheesecake dessert, because it tamed the heat on our tongues when drinking water didn't soothe us enough.  Friendly, attentive, professional service.  With an open kitchen, we can see the chefs making their masterpieces.  Highly recommended - especially for those who want to wake up their palettes!\", 'The service was great. However, the food left me yearning for something that is more fusion-y and creative. The cabbage wrapping around salmon and got served with green curry was interesting. It showed the techniques right there but I was puzzled by the kimchi.The spicy cold noodle with grilled pork was decent.', 'Asian fusion places are always hit or miss, and I would say Kothai is a hitMy boyfriend and I visited Kothai on a Saturday evening without a reservation. Luckily, the restaurant was not busy yet, and we were sat soon after. The menu features a variety of asian fusion dishes, focusing on Korean, Thai, and a bit of Chinese. We ordered chicken toast (4/5) and korean spicy noodles (4/5). The server was super attentive, always filling up our water. The ambient is also super adorable and modern - definitely pass the date vibe!', 'No Fees', 'My first time at a Korean Thai fusion place and this experience was amazing! The restaurant was very clean and had nice ambiance, very simple designs. The food was delicious and was bursting with flavor. Service was super amazing, staffs were attentive with making sure our waters were filled and changed our utensils/plates to new ones after appetizers. They also packed our leftovers for us, so nice! Kimchi Rice Balls: 5/5Kimchi fried rice shaped into a ball and fried. So good especially with melted cheese on top along with the aioli sauce.Korean spicy noodle: 5/5 We got it with the pork jowl and it was cooked perfectly where it sort of melted in our mouths. The amount of meat given was also very generous. Our favorite dish! Tom Yum Noodle Soup: 4.5/5This was a bit too spicy for me but it was good. I recommend making a reservation beforehand because it gets packed fast. I would come back to try their other dishes next time!', \"One of the best Korean and Thai fusion foods I've had! We absolutely loved the beef noodle soup which was so flavorful, and the Korean spicy noodle which beautifully combined Thai spices and peanuts with spicy Korean cold noodles!The place became packed up pretty quickly. luckily we were able to get seated without reservation, but we definitely recommend getting one. The ambiance is nice and casual.\", 'I LOVE fusion food, so KoThai Republic is right up my alley! KoThai stands for Korean + Thai I believe. They truly do fusion food the right way here--all the dishes we had were well thought out and such a perfect combination of flavors.- Crying tiger skirt steak: The steak was super tender and I loved the fresh herbs and the puffy rice on top. The sauce was delicious and we liked making lettuce wraps with these! Though it was a bit messy, heh.- Kothai ceviche: I love shrimp and this was no exception. The cured shrimp ceviche was citrusy and flavorful. - Korean spicy noodle with pork jowl: This was my favorite dish of the night. It had a good level of spice. This dish is cold BTW! I kinda liked it this way because the sauce was pretty spicy. The pork jowl was cooked perfectly.Service was very friendly! Make reservations on a weekend :)', 'Really great food with fresh feel and fresh ingredients. Great for groups and dinner plans the portions for one noodle is enough for 3-4 people and definitely super filling for ordering an app with 2 entrees. I loved the plating and how the galbi was presented with herbs and sauce that complemented it. Def need to try the other appetizers but the fam and I loved the noodles and will recommend the beef noodle soup as top choice!', \"Came here on a Sunday lunch and it was packed!  So I suggest making reservations on weekends.  Ambiance: casualService: goodFood: amazingI love their interior, it's simple with huge windows and they serve Korean Thai fusion food!My favorites: KoThai Ceviche ($17/2)- cured red shrimp with garlic, shallots, dill, thai peppers I believe served on little gem. I could eat like 3 of these!!Crying Tiger Skirt Steak ($28)- perfectly cooked steak with puffed rice, herbs, and thai chilis!!King Salmon Haw Mok ($30)- spicy green curry sauce with salmon wrapped in cabbage! This was so comforting to eat!! Great with rice!!They also have non spicy dishes and a great thai iced tea!! Would come back to try more of their stuff!!\", \"I was skeptical but my doubts were assuaged! Normally Asian fusion is a quick pass from me. There were so many positive reviews though that I decided to check it out and see if I had another reason to mistrust crowd-sourced ratings (which turned out to be not this time).Highlights:- Great customer service. I'm assuming it was an owner who greeted us, but regardless he was so friendly and welcoming that my family asked me if I knew him hahaha.- Korean cuisine fused with Thai, thumbs up from me. It actually works. The flavor of Thai peanut sauce in the Korean cold noodle dish was unexpectedly delightful, also the egg noodles in the braised chicken dish were delicious.- I liked the tomato salad dish. It was like a creative Southeast Asian-influenced Caprese salad.- Beautiful plating, feast for the eyes.- Cleanliness of the restaurant, good.- Online booking system makes creating and modifying reservations a breeze. I had written that it was my mom's birthday, and they went above and beyond - personally greeting her, complimentary dessert at the end.Lowlights:- When refilling our waters, our server picked up one of the glasses close to the rim where the diner's lips go. Our diner was really uncomfortable with that for hygienic reasons (the hand-mouth cross-contact).Overall, would return.\", \"Korean fusion spot. Great for date nights, family gatherings or eating alone. They food can take a while to arrive but the quality and flavor is worth the wait. I had the Thai Briased Chicken which came with a whole leg (marinated and grilled), the egg noodle is generously portioned and the broth was tasty. It's on the expensive side but hey if you want to impress your girl on the first date, take her there. Not too dressy, not too casual. Plus you can have a nice walk in Inner Sunset afterwards.\", \"1000% a must try! This was my first time trying a korean-thai fusion restaurant and it did not disappoint. Every single dish we got was amazing! If you have a low spice tolerance, I will say that the spicy food tends to lean higher on the spectrum of spice but still delicious regardless. The service was great and the restaurant is very cute. I will note that it's a pretty small restaurant and the tables are very cramped together so it's probably not the best place for big parties. Will definitely be coming back!\", \"Kothai Republic is an Asian fusion restaurant serving Korean and Thai inspired dishes. All the dishes were generally well thought out, but the execution was not really to my preference . That being said, it's definitely an interesting concept of a restaurant and my overall experience was still positive.We started with the kimchi rice balls and the chicken toast as starters. The kimchi rice balls were pretty interesting, like arancini but with kimchi fried rice instead of risotto, and had what I think is kewpie mayo for a dipping sauce. It was not bad I think the texture could've been better, and it didn't really blow me away (maybe if the sauce was more than just mayo?). The chicken toast was also pretty interesting but nothing super special, and the bread got a bit soggy. The chicken on its own wasn't super seasoned so the peanut tamarind sauce was the main flavor, which was fine.While the small plates felt a little weak to me, the two larger dishes we got were definitely more impressive. The crying tiger skirt steak was probably my favorite, with really tender strips of steak marinated in this bright tart and spicy sauce and served with herbs and lettuce and puffed rice (an amazing addition). My boyfriend's favorite was the korean spicy noodle, which were cold noodles and tossed in a spicy sauce, a dish kind of like bibim naengmyeon. It was definitely pretty spicy and a bit overpowering for me but it was pretty tasty. I think the best part of the dish was the grilled pork jowl it came with -- I would definitely order it again.While the dishes were a bit pricey and were not totally my style, I thought the servers were great and the ambiance was really bright and modern. I would maybe consider coming back again to try some of the other dishes.\", \"Came here on a Wednesday night and made reservations ahead of time just in case! It didn't get too busy but always better because you never know in SF.My friend and I ordered the ceviche, skirt steak and Korean spicy noodle. It was perfect for two people and everything was super flavorful!\", 'No Fees', 'Wow! One of my favorite fusion meals I have eaten. The menu consists of Korean food with Thai influence, which turns out to be an incredible combo! They do reservations on OpenTable, but luckily there was no wait on a Sunday at noon.+ Kimchi Rice Balls: This is a Korean twist on a popular Lao dish called Nam Khao. The kimchi is well made and contrasts the creamy mayo + cheese. The crispiness of the rice was soooo goood! I highly recommend this as an appetizer.+ Korean Spicy Noodles: The pork jowl was perfectly grilled and well seasoned. I was in love with this!!! The cold noodles were tangy and spicy, which complimented the savory/salty pork. This was my favorite dish! I would definitely eat this again.+ Bibimbap: Beautiful presentation! Fresh veggies, incredibly tender beef, and a custard-like poached egg. I enjoyed this a lot! The portions are big and every bite with that egg was the best. A great take on a classic bibimbap.', \"Very good experience at Kothai with unique dishes to try. The menu offers a selection of korean and thai fusion dishes that were all so tasty. You can tell that the chefs use high-quality ingredients to create flavors that are both authentic and innovative. The dishes are not only delicious but also beautifully presented. Each plate was prepared with vibrant colors, beautiful garnishes and well-balanced flavors. We had the Korean spicy cold noodles (my favorite dish), skirt steak, thai braised chicken thigh, and beef noodle soup. I loved the variety of flavors that each dish offered!  The restaurant's interior is bright and with simple decorations that make for great photos. It's a mix between a cozy yet luxurious ambiance. The staff was so attentive and friendly, ensuring our water was always filled and checked in to see if we needed anything. They were able to offer recommendations based on our spice tolerance and everything came out wonderful. Their professionalism adds to the overall atmosphere of the restaurant.\", \"Stopped in here to check it out. We made a reservation but probably didn't need it. It's cute inside and clean. Waitstaff was attentive and friendly. Food was delicious. I tried the kimchi rice balls. They had a nice crisp to the outside and not greasy. It was a bigger portion than I thought as well. I also got the crudo and was beautiful and flavors went well together. Fish was fresh and the smoked flavor came thru. For my main I got the noodles with pork. Noodles were good texture and pork was juicy. We had a bottle of sake and only wish there was more description about them. Staff couldn't answer questions about if they had filtered or unfiltered sake. We tried the hazy sake but is definitely not unfiltered. I also wish the description for the spicy noodles and pork mentioned they were cold noodles. Overall, good place to check out.\", \"I was intrigued by the unique and concise menu at KoThai Republic, a Korean and Thai fusion restaurant in the Inner Sunset of San Francisco. The owners Sung Park and Gof Sanguanwong previously ran a food truck Spork and Stix, and this is their first brick and mortar restaurant. The weekend menu is the same for both brunch and dinner - a vibrant mix of sharable small plates and comforting rice and noodle dishes. There were dishes that you may expect from KoThai's name, like bibimbap and tom yum noodle soup. I was also excited to see other influences, like an impressively flavorful Taiwanese beef noodle soup with a base made from scratch. Some of the more fusion dishes included kimchi fried rice balls - a nod to Italian arancini, but with kimchi, bacon, cheddar filling. The KoThai ceviche was Park's more accessible spin on traditional gejang, or Korean marinated raw crab. This (still quite spicy) version featured cured raw shrimp, served in lettuce cups. I also liked the eye-catching presentation of the grilled hamachi collar, usually a modest side dish. Served over an addictively good bed of fish sauce-loaded bread crumbs and broccolini, the collar could be the main star.The king salmon haw mok, traditionally a Thai fish curry steamed in banana leaves, featured baek (white) kimchi wrapped salmon in a hearty bowl of green curry. And the Korean spicy noodle dish was such an enjoyable combo of bibim guksu (spicy sweet cold noodles) with Thai style grilled pork jowl.Dessert was also memorable - a cute apple pie steamed cheesecake served in a glass jar. Brown sugar crumble and lime zest topped off this crustless combo.Service was very friendly, with Sung checking in multiple times and explaining the personal inspiration and context behind many of the dishes. Definitely a neighborhood gem worth going out of your way for.\", \"As someone who is a fusion fan, Korean x Thai fusion was a new concept and one that I was eager to try. My friends and I stopped by for dinner on a Tuesday night without a reservation and were immediately seated and served water. FOOD: They have a small rotating menu with appetizers, mains, and desserts as well as a drink menu. A small menu indicates they've refined a few dishes which I prefer compared to large lackluster menus. Plus, it makes dish selection a lot easier :) We ordered the following dishes: - Spicy Korean Noodles + Pork Jowl: this dish is a play on the Korean spicy Mul-naengmyeon and was not overly spicy for someone who eats mild spice comfortably. I loved that they included pork jowl as the meat of the dish. Beware that this dish is cold - I do wish this dish also came hot - it would taste even better in my opinion.  - Thai Basil Chicken + Egg Noodles: this dish was pretty good and which was not too dry. - Beef Noodle Soup: not your Taiwanese beef noodle, it has a different taste to it - can't quite place my finger on it, but do not order this expecting the OG Tawainese beef noodle soup.  SERVICE: Very friendly waiters who are knowledgeable about the menu. They also packed my friend's noodles to go and even separated the noodles and soup. When they gave us the check, they did not mention that the tip was already included for our party of 5ppl which I thought was odd. I should have looked carefully at the receipt, before tipping extra. It wasn't until I was charging my friends that I had tipped twice. I reached out to them on IG and they kindly refunded me the extra we had tipped them. I appreciate their integrity! AMBIANCE: The vibes and lighting inside is a 5/5! Very modern and clean. Only downside is that it is a little cramped. VERDICT: A very unique concept, though it seems to be more of Korean AND Thai dishes served on the same menu versus Korea x Thai fusion. I would return regardless to try their other rotating items.\", 'Lovely flavor, informative service when it came to describe what dishes they would recommend and modern ambiance! Reservations are easy to get, even day of, but the restaurant itself is small so booking one would be good to secure a table without a wait. The crudo was my favorite, perfect acidic sauce paired with the raw fish. Lots of complimenting thai flavors all across the menu, with an elevated modern twist on all the dishes. Would come back to try to other items on the menu!', \"This review is long overdue! Kothai is truly a neighborhood gem in terms of the execution of its wonderfully creative menu, extremely high quality of service and welcoming atmosphere with it's beautifully designed decor. My husband and all of my friends I've come here with have absolutely loved everything on the menu as well as its great selection of drinks. It's is not only a perfect spot for a romantic dinner, but also a great venue for a fun meal with friends. You can tell the staff is incredibly experienced and it's clear the owners genuinely care about bringing a top notch culinary experience to their guests. Kothai is the type of restaurant you'll want to become a regular. Superb!\", \"Came to Kothai on a very hot day in SF because I saw they had cold Korean spicy noodles which sounded perfect for the weather. There was plenty of seating around 5:30 when I walked in, but it did fill up fast, so would recommend getting a reservation for a larger group. The servers were extremely attentive, and I loved the plating and open air kitchen. The Korean spicy noodles were so tasty. The base of it is similar to naengmyeon with the chili paste but with Thai twists (peanut sauce, tamarind etc). There was a generous amount of meat, and I had a lot of fun crafting the perfect bite - a bit of pork jowl, some saucy noodles, a few crunchy veggies, and topped with their house chili sauce / crisps. The price is a bit high, but not crazy given it's SF. Final bill with tax and tip came out around $30 for this one dish, but I left feeling extremely full and satisfied.\", \"Another great place that's been on my radar in the sunset. It is a really modern looking interior and cozy aesthetic and one of the newer restaurants in the neighborhood.My group of 5 came in at 1030 pm and we were surprised that there was a good restaurant still open. Everything is well presented from the tableware to the food and layout. The chicken toast is really nice too get as an appetizer. The food is a lot bigger than the photos show. My friend got the beef noodle soup which according to him was very good and has all the items you would want in beef noodles. I got the tom yum which we were warned that it was spicy. But it was very good. Just the right amount of sweet sour salty and spicy. The pork was so good with the soup and the shrimp are juicy. I had to take the rest to go but it was even better the next day.Overall I would highly recommend this restaurant. The service was really exceptional and felt very professional. Good price for the food as well as very good operating hours.\", 'I learned about this spot through TikTok and was intrigued by the unique fusion that is Thai and Korean. At first glance the place is a bit small, but they were able to utilize the space well and have an open kitchen to peek into. I joined the OpenTable waitlist and quickly learned people were making reservations ahead of time to dine here, so will definitely make one next time! My party and I waited about 45 minutes Friday evening before being seated.The menu had many appealing options that it took us a while to order, but we narrowed it down after receiving recommendations from one of the waitresses. We were recommended their popular kimchi rice balls and the korean spicy noodles. The rice balls were interesting because at glance they look like regular rice balls, but some kewpie(?) mayo was added to complement the sour and salty flavor with its sweeter profile. The korean spicy noodled reminded me of naengmyun minus the ice broth. The pork protein was a great addition to the noodles. We also tried the chicken toast which reminded us of chicken satays (with the satay sauce and all).Overall I had a wonderful experience at Kothai and was met with high quality service. The place is a bit nicer than your usual casual spot. Great for a weekday dinner date with your partner or with friends to catch up. I learned from the waitress that they will have seasonal items on their menu, so I look forward to trying next time.', 'No Fees']\n",

The drinks and good were really good, we had the fried mushrooms and the Brussel sprouts on the side of the steak. All delicious and we will definitely return.

The duck breast was exquisite, tender, and wonderfully flavored (also quite a large portion size!). The pasta was also a stand-out for me, perfectly cooked.

The space if nice and the bar is a great place to eat and drink.  Although the bartender that serviced us had a flat personality we did see other staff who interacted well with customers and were friendly.  I would return but definitely would not recommend or try the burger again. Burger - 2.5/5 - I am admittedly not into thick patties on a burger, so Nopa's burger was an immediate turn off.  Still, I can appreciate a good burger but Nopa's just did not do it for me; at all.  Aside from being two inches thick the patty seriously lacked flavor.  Oh, and we asked for medium rare but got medium/medium well.  The meat dry and the bread did not hold together well.  Huge disappointment for, especially at a cost of $28. Fried Chicken - 3.5/5 - Tasty spices coated the skin exterior and the quarter bird was a great value.  However, the coating was fried to the point of being hard and the interior was not moist.  Maybe Nopa does not brine the chicken or maybe it was left in the fryer too long, either way the meat was dry and the fried chicken was okay at best.Roasted Cauliflower - 4/5 - I liked the texture and seasoning.  The beet purée was a perfect accompaniment.\", \"My sister and I travelled to SF for a siblings trip and my other sister suggested this restaurant. She has lived here for about 5 years and this is one of her favorite restaurants. I went here a few days ago and this is my favorite restaurant in SF. It is more expensive, but I understand why. Let me start out saying that this was the best broccoli and burger I've ever eaten. I was reaching for seconds and thirds of the broccoli. No broccoli or burger will ever compare to what I have tried here. The fried chicken was good and the crunchiest I've ever had. The pappardelle bolognese was tasty and filling. Really, you can't choose wrong here. Our server was very attentive and explained the menu well. There was never a time we needed something and didn't receive it. The food arrived about 45 min for the food was ordered. I will be back the next time I visit my sister. I cannot stop telling my local friends back home about the broccoli and burger.\", \"We really enjoyed this restaurant. The cocktails were the best part. They're a little expensive, but they are so cute, colorful, bright and delicious that it's so worth it! The food was excellent too. We got the duck breast and the pork chop, and those were both really tasty. It was busy and lively. Service was good too. You may need reservations, especially on a weekend.\", 'It is a sleek and cool restaurant with an upscale vibe! the cuisine was well made and delicious! The only negative was the Brussel Sprouts we found too salty.', 'Excellent food and excellent service at San Francisco prices.Firstly, make sure to make a reservation for this one as they are consistently booked up. I love places that are heavy on the shared plates so I can try a whole bunch and also love rotating menus. Every bite was delicious from the eggplant parmesan to the squash and corn flatbread to the peaches and stracciatella. Waitress had great recommendations. They used to have brunch which I heard was delicious and wish they would bring that back! As expected, it is not cheap but it is not outrageously price withers. Shared plates are around $20 and mains are $30-45 and I would recommend 3 shared places or one main and one shared for 2', \"A fun spot! The ambiance was excellent! I really loved the latke appetizer. The fried chicken entree was good for what it was. I'd love to come here to sit at the bar.\", 'Best burger in town.  Great chicken. Amazing martinis  Fantastic service,  recommend having a reservation or you will wait.', 'We were really looking forward to trying Nopa since some friends had spoken so highly of it, but it sadly did not live up to the hype. The pros: the food was yummy and the ambiance of the restaurant is great. Everything from the dining room to the bathrooms were decorated nicely. The cons: super expensive and overpriced for what you get, in my opinion. Our bill came to almost $140 for 2 apps and an entre, 1 cocktail, and 1 mocktail. We know pricing in the area is high in general, but compared to other meals we had for the same price the portions were super small (i.e., 1 slice of eggplant for $18), which was disappointing since it tasted great.', \"Made a reservation ahead of time on a Monday night, place was completely packed. Tall ceilings really helped with the sound control. Duck rillettes - well done dish, duck paired well with the breadCorn soup - in season corn was perfect for this soup. Perfectly smooth, good consistency, flavorful. Fried chicken - batter is flattened and tough, maybe that's what makes it Moroccan? Honey was a nice touch for more flavor. House pappardelle was also pretty good.House bread was disappointing and would be better if warmBurger was probably the most hyped and also most disappointing out of all the dishes. The patty is excellent but everything else was lacking.\", \"Had dinner at Nopa before seeing a show at the Independent. We sat outside and the parklet was heated, perfect for San Francisco weather. All of the food was delicious with simple, seasonal ingredients. One of my favorite ways to eat during the summer. Highlights were the corn salad side and the straciatella with grilled peach. We ordered a side of bread to go with the straciatella as well. Don't miss the bread, served with salted butter and was perfect. My only negative is that I feel it's a bit overpriced. Definitely recommend coming with a larger group so you can split and try more things. I'd make this a weeknight spot if the prices were a bit lower.\", 'San Francisco institution with some of the best Manhattan and burger combo in the city!', 'Nopa is def a local favorite and I totally understand why. Despite there being tons and tons of restaurants on Divisadero St, Nopa is unique in that you can tell they are really careful about their menu to make sure everything is local farm to table. The food screams \"California\" but is also more than just plain healthy food. We got this really good salad with peaches, walnuts, honey, and chunks of Stracciatella. We also got this flatbread with eggplants, zucchini\\'s, balsamic, and arugula. The sweetness from the eggplants and zucchini\\'s with the acidity of the balsamic worked really well together! We also got these lamb legs that weren\\'t my favorite but were cooked really well. This place is great for group dinners, service is great we chatted with our server for quite a bit- such a great vibe! Will be coming back soon', 'Solid burger consistent every time. The quality of the ingredients is what I love most.', 'This restaurant is top-notch worth visiting! The food is extremely fantastic, the wait staff very knowledgeable of their food. You can tell they are well trained and know how to create a verbal visual of their dishes. If I remember correctly, our server was Viv, and she took great care of our table of 6. It was a late reservation, so the dining area was scarcely filled w patrons. Nice high ceilings complimented the decor of the place -- it looked fancy, but at the same time, prices on the menu were affordable. We were all famished and knew exactly what we were having for dinner. The food and drinks were very quick to come out once  we ordered -- my tagine was just too big for me to finish it on my own, but the flavors were all there. I had a side of artesian bread and freshly made butter. The highlight of the meal was the dessert --- just decadent! Highly recommend!', \"Came here for dinner on Sunday at 6 without a reservation and was able to snag a table without any waiting. I got the pear and stracciatella, cheeseburger, and salted honey tart. The appetizer was pretty good, but wasn't anything too special. However, burger and fries was very good. The burger was cooked to perfection and incredibly juicy. I really enjoyed the fries as they were deliciously crispy on the outside and nice and fluffy on the inside. Dessert was pretty good as well. It was quite sweet but not overbearingly so. Overall, it was a good meal, would come back!\", \"What a delicious evening! While an expensive place, the portions were massive and quality was without a doubt amazing! Our server Max was super nice, in addition to fun costumes all around for Halloween. We ordered sooo much, and nearly fell on the floor.We began with drinks, the 50/50 Martini and the Hotel Nacional- both really good!In order of least favorite to favorite dishes (and all were delicious):5) WOOD BAKED GIGANTE BEANS, BREADCRUMBS, OREGANO PESTO AND FETA - very tasty, but wouldn't order again.4) PAPPARDELLE, NINE HOUR BOLOGNESE, BUTTERNUT SQUASH AND PARMESAN  - also delicious, but cold and didn't stand out that much to me.3) SMOKED BRISKET, LENTILS, ROASTED TURNIPS AND HORSERADISH CRÈME FRAÎCHE - tasted like hot pastrami that wasn't sliced, which was good and soft but not what I was hoping for.Please note that 2 and 1 were both legions above the rest and were amazing!2) WARREN PEAR, STRACCIATELLA, WALNUTS AND NOPA ROOFTOP HONEY - the cheese and honey and all in one mouthfuls were amazing!!1) MUSHROOM TOAST, FRESH RICOTTA, CARAMELIZED ONION AND BALSAMIC - just WOW. INSANELY GOOD!!We were unfortunately too full to order dessert. However the birthday girl got a complimentary brown butter cookie ice cream which was unbelievable!\", 'Super good food! The highlights were the fried chicken, mushroom toast, and persimmon appetizer. The chicken had an unbelievable crunch to it with a really unique flavor blend that we loved dipped in the chili honey. It was also a very generous portion! The mushroom toast was so flavorful on delicious bread that was so crispy and buttery. The only thing was our appetizers got pretty messed up and they didn\\'t do much to fix them. We ordered the mushroom toast and smoked trout appetizer and wanted a third option. We were deciding between three and asked the waiter, who wrote down all three appetizers, though we just wanted one of the three options. When we explained this to him when we got the appetizers that we did not order he only took off one from our bill as a \"gift\" to us because we were celebrating, rather than not charging us for 2 appetizers that we did not order. He also forgot the smoked trout which we really wanted to try but were so full by the time we could have it because of the extra appetizers that we couldn\\'t order it. Overall we totally understand that people make mistakes and our waiter was nice, but we didn\\'t feel that he adequately resolved this mistake which is why I took off a star.', 'Great food and menu. Really enjoyed the atmosphere. Definitely a place to go. Order the fried chicken!', \"I was delightfully surprised by Nopa's veggie forward menu. There's not a thing I would've changed about our meal. We started off with an order of bread - the butter was so fresh, delightful, and perfectly salted. Then, we got the smoked trout which was such a fun and playful dish - think Asian and Jewish fusion. The eggplant Parmesan was perfectly crispy, and the mix of pesto was just enough to elevate the dish. The gigante beans had such delicious breadcrumbs, and all the flavors slapped. The vegetable tagine had so many different veggies and tastes packed into one - the tartness of the yogurt, the salty/savory olives, ugh all of it came together perfectly!We ended with the chocolate budino which had cream, plum, and cocoa nibs. It was rich but the texture was light and creamy enough to not overdo it. The service was a bit slow and it was already pretty packed at 6:15 on a Friday, but if you're willing to take your time then you're in for a treat!\", \"Consistently rated one of the best burgers in San Francisco, I had this burger in my own Top Ten list from 2019.  I went back tonight and I'm glad to see some things have not changed post-Covid. The burger is simply fantastic...thick, juicy smokey burger...pickled red onion, butter lettuce and I added the bacon to put it over the top.  The fries were crispy and salty.  Perfection. Do your stomach a favor and go here hungry.Side note:  I had a 8:30 reservation for two, but got there at 7:30 and they were able to seat us, which was a pleasant surprise given the popularity of the place.\", \"My family reserved Nopa as a surprise dinner for my birthday and I loved our meal! They heard my many hints that Nopa is one of my favorite restaurants. This was my first time here with kids. They are generally kid friendly. I can't comment if they have high chairs or boosters (we didn't need any), but our kid's pasta came out very quickly and I saw other families there. We had a table on the first floor and the spacing was a little tight; they asked very nicely that our kids don't wander in the walking corridors between the tables. Totally understandable, but other restaurants might have a little more space and they would't be as strict about this ask.* Golden Fleece/Other Side Envy cocktail ($17) - 4 stars, nicely balanced, subtle, and tasty!* Little Gems, Strawberries salad ($20) - 4 stars, this looked simple but all the ingredients were insanely fresh.* Smoked Trout ($23) - 4 stars, a great array of flavors! * Moroccan Spiced Friend Chicken ($29) - * Country Pork Chop ($39) - 4.5 stars. This was insanely juicy, probably one of the best pork chops I've ever had.* Kid's Pappardelle - this came out very quickly, and our kids enjoyed it! The pasta was perfectly al dente and the sauce fresh.\", 'Everything was so delicious! The grilled peach appetizer paired so well with the honey-drizzled cheese and walnuts.My partner has had the burger here before and knew it was a stable and always a solid choice and never disappoints.I enjoyed the pork chop, and it was perfectly crisp on the outside while staying tender and juicy on the inside. It went super well with the sides which were really light veggies and tasted so refreshing together.The service was great, wine was smooth, vibe was awesome, definitely top notch experience.', 'Hands down, the best pork chop I\\'ve ever eaten! I was with a small group and we ordered the aforementioned pork chop, duck leg, fries, brussel sprouts, goat cheese, and potato latkes. The stars were easily the pork chop and the latkes (with smoked trout). The service was fantastic. They were very friendly and accommodating. Also, the vibe inside was ::insert the latest slang for \"cool\"::.', \"I came here on a Tuesday night and it was super busy! Really beautiful restaurant in a great location, we were seated on the upper area which gave a really nice view of the entire restaurant. Great location and really nice ambiance. For food, we started with the sausage and the rigatoni, and for mains we shared the flatbread and the Porchetta. Honestly I do not think any of these items stood out to me, everything was good but not very memorable. For dessert, we had the chocolate chip cookies and a chocolate pot de creme (not sure what it's called on the menu), which were really great! I honestly think the most standout thing was the shortbread that came with the chocolate pudding, it had a really delicate yet balanced flavour. Overall, I would return to nopa for the ambiance and since it's in such a great location, but not for the food itself. It was quite pricey for the items we got, but it is a really great spot for drinks.\", 'NOPA has a special place in our heart as we used to live in the neighborhood and came here for date nights. They always have the best pork chop. And funny when I text a friend we were dining there, she replied with \"best pork chop in SF.\" See, everyone agrees! The pork chop was cooked medium and came out juicy and so tasty. We started the evening sitting outside sipping cocktails and sharing French Fries and the Moroccan Fried Chicken entree as an appetizer between the 2.5 of us. Then we had the wine with Pork Chop, NY Steak, and Corn with Mushrooms and Tomatoes. Everything was tasty. Service was really good and we enjoyed our evening a lot. It was  busy for a Tuesday night but our server was attentive and checked on us. We always had a drink or sparkling water, and we didn\\'t go thirsty. We ended the night with a cocktail to accompany the Malted Milk Chocolate Ice Cream and a glass of wine to go with the Rhubarb and Lime Sorbet.', \"Wish I could give 4.5 stars because there are many excellent things about this place. The service was outstanding! Servers were knowledgeable, friendly, quick and not intrusive! The ambiance is fun and airy and considering the crowd, not terribly noisy. There were six of us so we got lots of different items from the menu. We ordered the bread and butter - exceptional, the dungeoness crab toast - generous and well seasoned, salad with avocado, oranges and nuts - fabulous! We also ordered the broccoli, and the cauliflower sides. Both were well prepared, tasty and generous. For the main courses we ordered the lamb meatballs, the pork chop, the pappardelli and the fried chicken. Everything was very good. Here's why I can't give them a 5. The fried chicken was perfectly fried and deliciously crispy but by itself was very under seasoned. It did come with a chili honey sauce but it was just too sweet for me. I found the menu here to be a bit limited. In other words if anyone in your party is a picky eater they may have trouble here. Be aware that the menu changes daily but they do seem to have some items consistently.\", 'Always a solid experience.I came here once in the past, but managed to get a dinner reservation for our group of four, which we were pleasantly surprised by. One of our party was vegetarian, but the rest of us decided to go family style on the recommendation of the waiter, who was super helpful and gave us super suggestions all throughout our meal.Starters:Tomato Soup - didn\\'t try this personally, but the table loved it!Josey Baker Bread + Butter - I mean if you have had this before, you know.Albacore - this was amazing. Our waiter described it as a \"deconstructed nicoise salad\", and you know what, he was pretty spot on. The albacore was perfectly seared, and the potatoes, peppers, olives, aioli, and green beans were just the right complements to the fresh fish.Mains:Moroccan Spiced Chicken - Super crispy, flavorful, and a generous portion for the table to sharePappardelle - Also really delicious and always a reliable option Cod - Looks like they don\\'t always have this on the menu, but this was perfectly seared and came with a generous side of broccolini - great lighter entreeThe above was a ton of food for three people to share, portions here are sizeable! We also ended the meal with a basil ice cream / stone fruit granita situation that the waiter recommended. This is one of those desserts that I think I\\'d be happy to come back just for. The phyllo bits in the granita were the perfect texture. Highly recommend!', \"Truly a delicious dinner experience! We made a reservation for a Tuesday evening and the place was poppin' even outdoors. The hosts were very accommodating of both our dogs and gave us a spacious yet tucked away table in their heated parklet. FOOD:We ordered 3 appetisers and an entree, which was ginormous and enough to leave 2 people stuffed. Overall delicious food focused on seasonal and local ingredients. I know this sounds like typical California cuisine but the execution is way above par!Fries (5/5): they're fries -- I was expecting them to be delicious but the aioli really put them over the top.Nectarine and stracciatella (5/5): This was the best thing we ate! The nectarine was almost stewed???? yet had a delicious char that complemented the milkiness of the stracciatella impeccably.Gigante beans (4/5): these were like a stewed bean dip with an oregano pesto. I liked it but it wasn't mind blowing (not that it had to be)Moroccan spiced chicken (5/5): SOOOOO crispy and juicy! There was probably 2 chickens' worth meat in there and it came with a yummy chili honey Overall I was really impressed with the place! Will go back and try dessert next time :)\", 'I\\'ve heard about this place for a while and finally got reservations to this place through Open Table and I will say the food is good but not absolutely \"amazing.\" Over all hit or miss for us and this is why: I will say though that the cocktails were indeed AMAZING, pricier price point but amazing for sure. So u would recommend going here for nice drinks if you are looking to take someone out somewhere with an elevated ambiance and innovative drinks that is worth the bang for your buck - this is the place. Food wise like I said it was good but wasn\\'t better than some other places I\\'ve been with a lower price point. The pork chop was actually kind of salty, moist, perfectly cooked but salty for sure. I liked the house made pappardelle actually but I felt like I had better at other more authentic Italian places in the city. The desserts though - AMAZING, they used very creative flavors and the guava tartlet we had with the scoop of cream cheese ice cream was sooooooo good! I still think this place is worth a try and would probably come back to try their other dishes.', 'I absolutely Do Not recommend this place.I came here with friends for my engagement dinner, We brought a cake we made ourselves and they made us pay $40 to let us keep it in their fridge. (But who cares)Everyone who worked there was very sweet except our waitress who was rude and greedyShe then asked if she we were ready for her \"to bring out the bread\" trying to deceive us that it was free but we realized it was in the menu and not complimentary or aka $7 for 2 pieces of bread and there was 8 of us. After we declined because we decided we didn\\'t want to spend $28 on bread for the table she acted disgruntled and annoyed!Back to the cake, they decided to charge us $3 a person to cut the cake and No they wouldn\\'t let us cut it ourselves, so we agreed.To conclude, be aware the 20% tip is already factored into the check which I would not say was deserved. Having us wait sometimes a good 15 - 20 minutes for a refill Can\\'t forget the 15 minutes for hot sauce that wasn\\'t needed by the time it arrived because there wasn\\'t any food left! Do not recommend Cool ambiance though.', 'I decided to get a reservation for Nopa as I was visiting SF and the Yelp reviews had the highest remarks. I was easily able to get reservations on Opentable a week or so out with no issues. A friend in SF told me Nopa was just fine and not worth it, but I didn\\'t listen. Mistake from me. On a cold night, I\\'m so glad I chose an indoor reservation for my party of 2. We did show up 4 minutes early, but we were not seated until 15 minutes after our reservation time at 8:15pm tonight. For a place that consistently gets super booked up, you would think they have a good pattern down. It was even more disappointing to know when I walked to the back of the restaurant to the restroom and noticing 4+ empty tables that were cleaned off and the table set. Once we were seated, the manager came by and apologized for the seating delay and told us there would be a gift from the chef. Great service (or so we thought).We decided to order the braised lamb shoulder and bread for our appetizers and a cider. The gift from the chef was the potato latkes. The lamb dish was so yummy and flavorful. I did wish there was more meat, but so delicious. The bread was good as well but the plating was odd as it tried to maintain a more modern approach. The potato latkes were so good and I enjoyed every bite. Potato latke itself might have been a smidge over fried but I love extra crispy potato. After finishing our appetizers, we waited more than 30 minutes for our entrees. At this point, we were both ready to go elsewhere as the delay was so long. Also, the server I had took my cider glass I had away while I still had several sips left in my glass?? He never asked if he could take my glass or if I was finished? I was just rather too shocked to stop him in that moment. I don\\'t know how this would be classified as good service especially as I paid for my full beverage and I expect to have it in its entirety. For our entrees, we ordered the cheeseburger and the New York steak. My boyfriend got the avocado and bacon on his burger as well for an extra $6. He liked the burger and overall said it was good, but he noticed the patty itself was not cooked evenly. The New York steak for me was the BIGGEST disappointment. As a big steak lover, this was a miss. I always eat steaks a medium rare and this steak was easily a rare in the very center and really blue. The steak and potatoes lacked salt. Potatoes seemed to be an afterthought with no flavor. The cilantro and herb blend they put on top had an incredibly weird and off putting flavor. It seemed they were trying to go in the chimichurri direction and missed. I\\'ve truly had better steaks and more enjoyable at Longhorn. I had maybe 4 bites before getting it to-go for anybody else to have. We planned on getting dessert here, but I was really so over Nopa at this point. I asked for the check, signed, and left before seeing the amount charged onto my credit card which was over the amount I estimated mentally. I called Nopa and asked for my receipt to verify my receipt. Nopa charged my table with the \"gift from the chef\". Mistakes happen, but this \"gift\" actually was more of a inconvenience for me. All in all, I won\\'t be back here and can\\'t recommend it given the other spectacular places in the area.', 'I call this robbery by the bar.  No one disclosed, no one asked. I ordered a vodka and cranberry. They overcharge me $3 to MAKE THE COCKTAIL (see attached photo).  Please, refresh my memory: isn\\'t that what any bar and bartenders do?  Well, at NOPA apparently not.  I went and spoke to the manager who obviously couldn\\'t care less and was dismissive (and walking away with my receipt) saying for me to \"feel free to post\" when I asked for my receipt back and said that I was going to post.  By the way, the bartender was also dismissive when I asked what was the \"cocktail charge\".  IF I knew, if I had been told in advance, I would have done the mixing myself or I would have simply left.  All those extra charges in the restaurants in the city are sickening and an utter abuse of the patron\\'s good will and tolerance.', \"I am leaving a review for the dessert and interior alone since me and my partner came here for a dessert date. Selfishly, I ordered the persimmon cake which, from reading on the menu, looked like nothing my partner would eat, but alas I persisted and ordered it anyway. I got myself a tea as well and while we waited we watched the kitchen work its magic. I've always enjoyed seeing the organized chaos of an environment but never knew a chefs table seat was something real. I know its not for everybody but if you care at all about a professional kitchen, get yourself a seat and enjoy! The relationship between all the cooks and the main chef, as well as watching everyones individual stations was such a sight for me. Honest to god would come back here just to watch these talented people make food.As for the cake, as predicted not loved by my partner, but I absolutely enjoyed it. The pomegranate with the delicate cake and vanilla ice cream all brought together for such a wonderful dining experience. One of the best desserts I've had in a while. The interior is truly lovely and I wish I remembered our waitresses name but she was such a joy. We got to speak briefly to the chef and I completely embarrassed myself as I was still totally entranced with the entire place. I'd love to come again someday.\", \"One of the best pork chops I've ever had! The ambience is phenomenal. The service is exquisite and their seasonal and ever changing menu Never fails to Disappoint. It is one of the safest bets if you're in San Francisco for a restaurant to go to!\", 'I brought some friends from out of town here last Thursday night. Due to the weather, we were lucky enough to get reservations the night before. We got there 2 hours early since we were already in the area, and they did not turn us away and took such good care of us! We even got seated an hour earlier than our reservation. Hands down, the service is phenomenal here. They took care of our coats and did not rush us during our dinner (which tends to happen a lot close to the end of the night) The meal was obviously great, the food here is so fresh and simple and executed so well.', \"We walked by Nopa and decided to stop for a late night meal. It is a beautiful restaurant and the food was phenomenal! Everything that came out was gorgeously plated and tasted even better than it looked. The lamb tartare was a prefect starter. The house made pappardelle, nine hour bolognese was the best pasta and bolognese I've ever had - my mouth is still watering for it. The duck leg paired perfectly with the sides. We rarely order dessert but had both the strawberry tiramisu and blueberry pie and WOW! They have dessert wine pairings as well. Our servers were attentive and friendly. I'm sure everything else on the menu is great but I would go back for the same exact order again and again! You don't want to pass up this palatable meal.\"]\n",

      "Reviews: ['Got a question about Otra? Ask the Yelp community!', 'Otra takes classic Mexican flavors and adds its own touch to create some really interesting dishes. They have mushroom tacos that have such a great flavor that even meat eaters would want over other options. I usually get the fish tacos which come very crispy and juicy. Their servings are medium sized but I tend to leave pretty full.', 'Restaurant had a good ambiance for date night. The service was good but they seemed understaffed.The food is okay, the beef tacos and sweet potatoes tacos were good. The fish tacos made me sick', 'The restaurant has nice setting, and they have great selection of food. Been here many times and I can say that the food has an excellent quality. So many great variety of flavors. The tacos were all appetizing and it was well-prepared, it has lots of veggies and it so meaty!The place was cool, and its better to get reservation. Nice seating and it has pleasant ambiance. Great customer service.', 'Came here on a Saturday with no reservation and got seated immediately! Good:- Charred lettuce was amazing! What a cool dish, it had cool texture too.- The mushroom tacos were surprisingly good and flavorful! - nice dimly lit place great for catch-ups- Food came fast Bad:- I thought the cod tostada had very little flavor and was expensive so not worth Overall worth trying out!', \"This place is right next to Danny Coyle's where I come in for morning soccer games over weekends and I finally gave into the temptation to try Otra as I was heading out on a Saturday afternoon.Amazing mushroom tacos! Loaded with mushrooms. The huge variety of fillings in the taxi gave it such an amazing flavor. It is sorta spicy in itself, but if you're a spice lover, ask them for their spicy sauce on the side. It makes it even better. I'd definitely rate this dish 5/5. The only downer for me was that there were only two tacos for $14, and that seemed a tad pricy despite the inflation, the location in SF, and the quality of the food. I wish there was one more taco. Maybe it's the right price and I probably didn't get the right feel of the ambiance since I came in at 11:30 AM by myself. The restaurant was fairly empty and there were less than 5 people. The lady who took my order was very friendly! I was confused if I should get another plate of tacos (sweet potato) but I didn't want to spend over $30 for a brunch meal by myself. I will definitely be back once again after another soccer game, because I want to try some of their other dishes. I rate the place 4.5/5, but I couldn't round off to 5 because of the portions for a $20 meal with tip. :(\", \"A little loud, but the food is delicious. The waitstaff is very nice and does a great job. Can't wait to go back\", \"Drinkies: Jalisco 75-LOVED ITHouse margarita spicy with tequila- GREAT! Appz: Aguachile -the fish they used was super tender. It had a nice spice that creeps up on you-but could use a little more spice and flavor (just my opinion). The chips they used were great (crispy/salted). Dinner:Beef taco: pretty delicious! Would be better if they doubled the tortilla since there was a lot on one. But the beef was tender and flavorful. Recommend this one! Concha's borrachas: DO NOT RECOMMEND. Had a very fishy sus taste. We only ate a couple bites and just didn't trust it. The chorizo didn't have flavor. Ambiance is cute and romantic! Service overall was good- a little on the slower side. Clean and the decore is cute!\", 'Finally got to try Otra! We walk by it all the time and I guess the San Diegan in me was hesitant to try this and be severely disappointed (bc we\\'re taco snobs). And I gotta say, my partner and I were pleasantly impressed. It\\'s good for what it is, this isn\\'t your homestyle/street food type mexican food. This is your \"fancy resort in mexico type\" and for that, it is good. Especially paired with their well made cocktails, thats a win. In terms of food, I recommend the beef tacos. Its not dry and has lots of flavors, ask for their habanero hot sauce if you wanna kick it up a notch. Their al pastor tacos were fine, it didn\\'t have the classic red char but it wasn\\'t bad. Drinks are dangerously good though, if you like mezcal, this is the place to try it. I liked my Paloma and my partner enjoyed his old fashion (i forget the actual name).', \"This place was very good! Not like mind blowingly good or anything like that, but a solid Mexican brunch place. Came here today with my sister and brother in law, and their pup Bailey. They have outdoor seating and it wasn't cold out (rarity in SF this winter) so it worked out perfectly. We got some chips and salsa, and I got the beef hash. My sister got the beef tacos and my brother in law got the pozole. The chips and salsa were great - only thing that could have made them better was warm chips but who cares. The salsa was certainly house made, very good kick, and surprisingly the salsa verde was a bit hotter than the rojo. My hash was nothing to write home about honestly but what can you expect, its potato, veggies and cut up beef. I guess the beef just wasn't that flavorful (didn't seem to have really any Mexican flavor to it - cumin, etc.), or tender. But it was still a solid dish. The eggs were perfectly poached with a nice orange yolk. I also tried the beef tacos and those were yummy, though my sister thought they were spicy. Brother in law loved his pozole. Will probably be back again because it is close by, wasn't busy and the service was good!\", \"Amazing little spot! The food is amazing. We had the frijolitos for an appetizer which was terrific. We are salsa and chips people but you have to try the frijolitos they are game changers. The beef and quesabirria tacos were both killer, but to our surprise the sweet potato tacos stole the show. This restaurant is a gem and even more so if you are vegetarian or gluten free. The marg's are no joke too. Make sure you stop here!\", 'Got a question about Otra? Ask the Yelp community!', \"Great spot for a nice, tasty dinner. Lots of veggie options. The two of us split the beans+chips, ensalada, and mushroom tacos. The beans+chipswas a little salty and the chips themselves weren't amazing. The ensalada was really really delicious and herby. The tacos were by far the star of the show! It was a spicy, umami bomb! They were pretty tiny tacos though, I don't think two tacos alone would have filled me up. We also each got a cocktail--tasty and strong. Service was just okay! Overall definitely recommend this place for a nice dinner out!\", \"Very tasty, but also very salty, especially the mussels that we got. With the chorizo, it would've been nice to have it a bit less salty. Enjoyed the two salsas that came with the totopos and salsa appetizer--both were complex and mouth warming. The mushroom tacos were full of umami and well-balanced, though on the mushy side if you care about textures. Everything tasted fresh and made with quality ingredients. The drinks were solid and positively cheap at $12 a pop. Service was great, and the vibe inside was great for a casual-ish date. Did this place stand out among the many great Mexican/taco places in the city? Not really. But I didn't try their meat tacos, so maybe that would've made the difference!\", 'Located in Lower Haight, this tapas restaurant offers a delightful dining experience. During my visit with a friend, we sampled the beef tacos, al pastor pork, and totopos with salsas. While all the dishes were enjoyable, the beef tacos stood out with their excellent sauce, tender beef, and a harmonious blend of flavors. They were so good that we ended up ordering seconds! The Al Pastor, though slightly chewier than expected, still offered a flavorful taste, especially when paired with the diverse and flavorful salsas that accompanied the chips. The margaritas were refreshing, striking a perfect balance between sourness and sweetness, and the option to share a pitcher was a welcomed feature. Overall, this is one of the top Latin spots in the area, and I highly recommend it to those in the vicinity or nearby residents.', 'Excellent foodGreat ambiance Very unique dinner that truly surprised and delighted us', \"My friend and I started off with the aguachile. If you like raw fish preparations, this is the dish for you. It was citrusy, flavorful, and VERY spicy. In our case, this was a positive but mind the spice if you're not as big of a fan. It was just the perfect thing to wake our palettes up. Also as a bonus, the portion size was bigger than I expected. For entree, we  shared the mushroom tacos and beef tacos which were a great compliment to each other. The mushroom tacos were also a bit spicy but you can ask for them without the chili flakes on top which would moderate the heat. All the dishes were super savory and delicious. The service was excellent and our waitress spent time with us walking through some dishes that would be perfect for the level of appetite we were at. I look forward to coming back with an even bigger group because the tapas format lends itself really well to sharing.\", 'Good food, service and beers.  I love the ambiance, the place is cute and really good for catching up with friends. We were hungry after getting a few drinks and my friend suggested to try it. We ordered the meatballs, aguachilles and the spicy broccoli and we loved all of them.', 'Love this place especially for vegetarian or vegans! Lots of options for us. They have mushroom, squash, and bean tacos and all of them are well curated and delicious. The drinks are delicious and unique. Everything we tried was amazing. Service was very friendly and the ambiance was casual while still being very nicely decorated. I loved it since it was perfect for all kinds of scenarios!', 'Wow! Otra is a wonderful spot for food in the Lower Haight. The decor of the restaurant is consistent and a fun mixing of textures all in shades of blue. At night it is cozy.In terms of the food, they do vegetables here very very well. The charred cabbage and roasted Brussel sprouts were flavorful. Each bite has the right balances of umami, salt, acid, and heat. The cod tostada was skillfully executed to preserve the fish (without going dry), keep a crunch on the tostada, yet round out the flavor profile.I had a margarita that evening and it had acidity that was delightful. It also was not heavy handed with the tequila and was balanced well. The service here is attentive without being pushy or overbearing. I thought they handed our party of seven well, and we never felt like there was a significant gap for plates to come out. Overall, I will be back!', \"Stopped by just for a drink & the cucumber cocktail was spot on as well as my michelada, we had already ate or else we would've ordered some food.

They were excellent.Three glasses of Azul Resposado started out the dinner (my wife had the Santo Tomas Merlot, but tasted the tequila). The young men each had a Mezcal Margarita chaser.My one complaint - they actually charged me $1 for extra chips! Bush league, my friends - especially after the Azul Resposado. Lost a star on that move!', \"I saw this place while driving along Lower Haight. I decided to stop by because my curiosity is somehow telling me to try this place. So I decided to stop after work. Once I stepped into the restaurant, I didn't realize this restaurant is not your typical Mexican restaurant. It's pretty classy. I was wearing a scrubs upon going inside the restaurant. But who gives a f? I'm hungry and I wanted something to eat.I order the Beef Tacos and the Vegatables y Gigante Bean Ribolitta. I also ordered the cake for dessert and the Old Oaxacan. I don't mind the food for being pricey but servings are pretty small. The staff is wonderful and accomodating.\", 'Five stars because Haight Street needs more places like this. Four stars for food. The Frijilitos (bean dip) was the star dish. The mushroom tacos were missing something in terms of taste factor. Cute outdoor seating. Surprisingly nice stretch of Haight.', \"Food: We did family style and shared all the plates. We got the totopos and salsas first. Both of them were absolutely amazing. I'd love to take them home and add them to all my meals(note: red one is mild spicy) The totopos were perfectly crunchy, and a little on the salty side. The brussels sprouts. I don't know where to start. Probably the best ones I have had. The amount of flavor is perfect, the texture and crispiness is perfect, I loved everything about them. The sweet potato tacos were super good, very loaded, but I recommend adding some of the red and/or green salsa to them! Beef tacos were also great!Dessert: tres leches. Perfect texture, one of the best tres leches I have had. Drinks: Poco Poco (mezcal + watermelon) had a tajin rim, great drink. My friend had the Penicillin 42 (mezcal + ginger) and was super happy with it as well. Service: I added ourselves to the waitlist saying I'd be there in 20-30 minutes. When we arrived they checked us in, we waited for 3 minutes for the table.\", 'Absolutely delicious! We will definitely come back. We devoured the beef tacos, mushroom tacos, and chips/salsa. Our only complaint is portion sizes and prices.', \"We used waitlist to queue for the restaurant so we were able to get in as soon as we arrived. The place is quite nicely decorated, although the music and the whole place was too loud for me so I can't really enjoy being there.The vegan options are plenty which I really appreciate! They taste alright and the waiting staff are less helpful in making recommendations than we'd wish they are.\", 'This place has unfortunately gone downhill since I first visited back in 2021. While the cocktails here are still consistently good, the food can be a hit or miss (lately the latter). I recently had a weekday dinner here (with no wait) and tried the following:- Frijolitos con chips (0/5): What a disappointment! The bean dip was so watered down that I would consider this bean water or bean juice (with no pulp) instead of a dip. There\\'s also supposed to be queso in this, but I didn\\'t see any. This was the biggest disappointment of the night because the bean dip here was so much better when I first had it over a year ago.- Cod tostada (2/5): This was somewhat bland, and the tostada can easily be mistaken for something found at a fast food chain. The redeeming factor was the cod, but there were so few tiny pieces of cod. - Grilled pork ala pastor (3/5): The pork was flavorful and juicy, and I liked the texture of the tortilla. But the \"refried beans\" were more watery/liquid than refried, and the \"green rice\" tasted like plain rice. - Jalisco 75 cocktail (4.5/5): I really enjoyed this tequila cocktail! It was refreshing, and the elderflower really shined through nicely. Overall, this was a disappointing experience. I\\'d stop by Otra for a cocktail before dinner, but I\\'m not sure if I\\'d want to risk another bad dinner here unless the food quality picks back up again.', \"Really cute decor and a very popular restaurant. We waited a while for a table on Friday night. We ordered the chips and salsa, mushroom tacos, beef tacos, cod tostados, and the kampachi. They have good veggie options as my vegan friend also ordered sweet potato tacos and the carrot tostados. Our server was super friendly and great, but unfortunately the food was overall just okay for me. Maybe slightly better than avg tacos but I might have had higher expectations given the reviews. The cod was a bit dry and my favorite dish were the beef tacos. It's still worth giving this place a try though!\", 'Got a question about Otra? Ask the Yelp community!', 'We came in for a late dinner and focused on their veggie offerings. The highlight was the charred cabbage salad which was smoky and tasty. We tried some tacos as well. The mushroom tacos were over seasoned and salty although my dining partner liked them.  The salad could\" have been more thoroughly dressed as there were lots of bites that just tasted like plain kale. A nice venue, good veggie selection. I\\'d come back and give it another', \"Outstanding find in the Bay Area! The mushroom tacos with cojita cheese are unparalleled. Beef tacos boast juicy, citrusy flavors with the perfect salty-spicy balance. Don't miss the fiery kick of the spicy mezcal margarita with its zesty sea salt rim. Ceviche is a must-try appetizer, while the chips and frijolito dip are a flavorful delight. House-made hot sauce adds an extra kick. Reasonable prices round out the experience.\", \"Went here with a friend who's a vegetarian (and chose this place for being veggie friendly). I'm happy she chose this place! The service is friendly and pretty quick. They have a cute parklet and a few sidewalk tables, which is really nice for warm days/nights! They also have heat lamps. I got the fish tostada and it was just ok...the mushroom and sweet potato tacos were actually the standouts for me! So much flavor for things that don't have meat! ;)As a meat lover, I would recommend this place for anyone to try. But try the veggie options because I think they're better!\", \"Fun weekday spot for good Tapas.Arrived at 6:30 on Wednesday night and got seated right away in the back. Note there is no cell service in the back of the restaurant (not a big deal but something to note).We started out with the Aguachile which was phenomenal but really spicy. If you get this, it is really great but expect some spice because it's got some heat!We then also had the chips and salsa (first thing on the top of the menu), which was great as well. The chips are thick and the salsa is smoky and delicious - exactly how I like it.We got the cabbage salad which was crispy and flavorful. This isn't something I've ever had before, but it was really unique. Would get again.For our mains we split the beef tacos, fish tacos and the pork tenderloin main entree. The beef tacos and pork tenderloin were. phenomenal. Very flavorful and nicely balanced.The only part of the mean that I really did not enjoy were the fish tacos. They were really fishy and not super appetizing. I couldn't eat my portion and no one else from our party ate their full portion either. This felt like a miss when everything else was so good.Overall I would definitely come back.\", \"I am having a full love affair with Otra! Food is so flavorful, the Brussels sprouts are a must have, ceviche, tacos, you can't go wrong. Their Escondido cocktail might be my fav in the city, and I don't even like gin. Fun vibe inside, it's perfect for happy hour or date night!\", 'First of all the food here is absolutely delicious. Started off with one of their lime aid beverages, and it was fantastic I had to. I could not get enough of it. Then I ordered chips and salsa, one with heirloom, roasted tomatoes, and another with a moly that was absolutely astonishing. I do highly recommend. The ceviche is copious and delightful. Very tasty. I had the meatballs (albondigas) they we hearty, smoky, just enough spice, and filling. Last but not least I had the coconut flan that was beyond exceptional and a rare find. This places has copious seating, couples, families, and perfect for large groups. ADA accessible ramp to the upper dining area and outdoor seating and cool vibes devour makes this a major find in my book and an absolute gem of the neighborhood! The service was prompt, and the food runners last the ensure food coming to table in why can be a fast paced eating environment.', 'Great drinks. Food was fine but overpriced for what it was. The vibe was a little stale', 'small menu but a fun place to have dinner. we had the kanpachi and tacos. the carnitas and beef tacos are great. service is slow', \"Some of the most flavorful vegetarian tacos I've had in the Bay Area! Loads of options and great service! Will definitely be coming back!\", \"Nice little place with indoor and outdoor seating. We arrived early- 5:30 or so- and we had the indoor seating to ourselves for maybe 10 minutes, then it completely filled up by 6pm.... So get there early. Excellent Cerviche, probably one of the best we've had, with a generous serving with lots of shrimp, avo, cokes, hearty juice- so ask for extra chips. We had carnitas and carne asada tacos, both were excellent but the asada had bigger flavor. The cocktails were also excellent- the spicy margarita is really spicy- and the Paloma was made with fresh grapefruit juice. Glad we found this little spot. Four cocktails total, appetizer Cerviche and two orders of tacos (two per order, we shared one each) was $120.00 before tip, which seems to be pretty typical for SF these days.\"]\n",

      "Reviews: ['Saw that this place had been opened for a while and I finally got around to trying it. Once I got there, the lady (boss? i think) was super nice saying to just put my name down on the waitlist and said it would take about 15 minutes. We (party of 4) got seated and the lady (same one) said to us very enthusiastically \"ITS COLD. I\\'LL GIVE YOU SOME MILK TEA.\" She proceeded to ask us what flavors we would like, sugar preference, even asked us if we wanted pudding or lychee jelly. We all went along with her and gave her our preferences, thinking all of this was on the house. I guess it\\'s also our fault that we didn\\'t clarify but it turned out to not be free. I just wished she would have told us that it would cost money. We all ended up spending $24 on drinks that we wouldn\\'t have ordered if it wasn\\'t on the house. Other than that, the food was good. I got the sichuan beef flavor that\\'s 3 fire signs but tasted like 1 fire sign. Kinda gross tho because one of my friend had a piece hair that\\'s not from the head in one of their side dishes. Aight TLDR- don\\'t get scammed when they say lemme make you some milk tea and double check if it\\'s free or nah. ngl the milk tea is good but not good bc i feel scammed. ya knur?? food was good.', 'We ordered the tomato beef soup and green pepper fish fillet soup. Both were delicious, but if you are looking for something with more of a kick, I would definitely order the green pepper fish fillet. The drinks were also really refreshing and the decor was cute! There was a small line when we got there but we got seated after 15 mins, so the wait was not bad at all. The owner and everyone there were all really nice and were constantly checking on up us.Would recommend for anyone who is in the spot to try it out!', \"Noodles are my obsession -- so when Oodle opened up, I knew I had to go.The spicy sichuan noodles did not disappoint. Portion size was great, the soup was flavorful, and the juice drinks were great too! (this is coming from a guy who almost always gets beer with his noodles).The staff were friendly and easy to talk to. Food came out quickly. The store was clean and cozy. I'll definitely be coming again. (Their menu tastes great to-go as well, which is a hard thing to achieve for noodles!)\", \"AMAZING!!! I am so glad that I've found this place!  Came here on a Saturday afternoon around 2pm and was seated quickly.  Owner was friendly and offered some tea. We wanted noodles and knew that we would be too full if we drink tea.  There are many soup options..I ended up selecting spicy pot.  It was delicious!! The broth was deep and rich without any heaviness.  I love display of side dishes and vegetables.It's a small restaurant- clean, cute and very casual.  Service is very good and friendly. I cannot wait to come back!\", \"A new place on the block! Definitely popular. To break it down it's a cute, 6 tables, clean, quick service and warm family run restaurant. Menu is limited but has something for everyone. Big value for money!So the concept is similar to hotpot but it's just real hot soup with sides and noodle (deconstructed noodle soup)The most spicy soup on the menu was flavorful, not too spicy. All ingredients felt fresh and well served. I was going to order chicken soup which is creamy and non spicy but I opted for pickled pork soup instead which I definitely think was a better option. We ordered Popcorn chicken, garlic fries, lychee smoothie with cream(highly recommend) and pandan milk tea (least fav order) and the total came up to $55 + TaxIf you're looking for fresh, healthy meal you should visit!Thank you for the warm service. See you'll!\", \"tldr; this is a new restaurant in the richmond! come here if you're craving delicious, piping hot rice noodle souprecs: popcorn chicken, green pepper noodle soup with fish fillet (if you enjoy mala flavors)Oodle is a beautifully decorated rice noodle restaurant new to the Richmond community as of the end of October. The bridge with ten different side dishes to add to your noodle soup is one of its unique qualities and made my dining experience here super entertaining. For ~$25/pp, my friend and I left this restaurant positively stuffed with popcorn chicken to go. As someone who constantly craves mala flavors, I loved the green pepper soup. The broth was also scalding which makes it a great dine-in experience and a perfect option for rainy days in the Richmond. Tip: try the chili oil at the table with the fish fillets -- it's super tasty!Service was super attentive. Someone who looked like the owner was going around making sure guests were happy with the food. We got our waters refilled several times. My friend and I are already thinking of our next trip back here when the cold weather returns to SF. :)\", 'Came in on a Saturday at 2PM with a party of 3- we ended up waiting 30-40 minutes to be seated as it was busy. There were two benches for us to sit on while we waited. Once we were seated, I ordered the Crossing Bridge rice noodle as I was looking for something more light but filling. Food was solid and I loved the little plates of food on the bridge and how they were presented. Ate the whole bowl swiftly and appreciated how I could customize it with the sides. Although the wait was a bit long, the food came out swiftly and I thoroughly appreciated a good bowl of noodle soup for a rainy day. My friends ordered the tomato beef brisket rice noodles and chicken rice noodles and also enjoyed their meals. My order came out to be $21 including tip.', \"Located just nearby Devil's Teeth is Balboa St's new noodle place! It's quite small inside with about 20 people seating so if it's busy.... it'll be a wait!We came on a Saturday during lunch with 3 groups ahead of us and we waited for about 15 minutes for table of 2. Service was prompt and engaging throughout the entire meal! I ordered the sichuan spicy broth with beef. The components of the soup are presented on a bridge which I thought was super cute! The beef and noodles are all served separately, so YOU are in control of what and how much goes into your soup. The beef was yum and I thought a lot of the side add in's were just ok. The sichuan broth was kinda sichuan-y but not really spicy so it wasn't really up to my expectations of a sichuan spicy broth.Worth checking out in the area!\", \"Small little rice noodle house! It's ran by a lovely couple and they're are so nice. The restaurant is relatively small with a limited number of seats. Arrived around 7pm for a party of 5 on a Sat and luckily a large party happened to be leaving.I ordered the Yunnan Spicy Small Pot Rice Noodles and it was perfect for the cold weather! Mild-Medium spicy and since it was served in a pot, the soup stayed hot for a long time. Once they serve the soup, dump the noodles and small dishes in. Also had the popcorn chicken, cucumber and cold tofu (forgot to take pic). My favorite was the cucumber since it was very flavorful and the peanuts added a nice crunch!Service was attentive and the owner came to check in with us multiple times. Highly recommend!\", \"Walked by and ordered a popcorn chicken because we were craving a quick little snack. I have had it before and it was pretty good. I got it again and this time it was slightly less salty which was lack of flavor. But everything else was good cos it was hot. Wish it had more basil as well. I also had to ask for pepper (they don't have it in the togo option). The boba was decent but was big and didn't finish. I will come back next time but ask for more salt if it isn't salty enough. I haven't tried the noodle soups yet so I will have to!\", 'A small place that delivers a big flavor. The fun toppings will show up on your table as soon as you order. The broth comes up super hot, so be careful. According to the owner, the broth has been simmered for over 10 hours with various bones and ham, no MSG added. Be sure to call ahead to reserve your seat.', \"The interior, presentation and service were all amazing! I think it's really cute that all the noodle sets come with the side dishes on the bridge & the servers/owner were very welcoming and friendly. The price of the noodle sets are around $16-$20 depending on which one you getIn terms of the food the noodles tasted very fresh - they are also quite soft (not really chewy) so good for all ages as well. I think the broth was quite flavorful, rich and aromatic which I appreciated. Popcorn chicken was ok too.I think overall food would be 4/5 but service presentation and pretty interior bumps it up\", \"Ever since I had one of the best crossing the bridge noodles in Brooklyn NY's Chinatown, I've been wanting more. A couple places in the Bay Area sell this noodle dish but all of them left the craving unsatisfied. When I saw an Oodle Yunnan post, I knew I had to grab my husband (the driver) to take me there! He got the #1 original crossing the bridge noodle. One sip of the broth got us both cheesing hard. The owner stopped by to tell us about the homemade broth which is simmered for hours. I got the #7 green pepper fish filet cause im a sucker for anything that's spicy with fish. The broth was out of this world flavorful! The owner told us he has many customers pack leftover broth home to add noodles to. I would've done that... if I didn't drink most of it already. We got an order of their popcorn chicken to share which was perfectly crispy on the outside and steaming hot and juicy on the inside. The fried basil flavor carried over well too. I saw a couple reviews mention the small portion size but I felt it was a perfect amount of food for us. I got pretty full at the end and I have a big appetite! My only complaint is that Oodle Yunnan is out of the way for me! 5 stars!\", 'Came here during their soft opening. We ordered 2 Crossing Bridge Rice Noodles and a popcorn chicken. The Crossing Bridge Rice Noodles dish consisted of an extremely hot bowl of soup with the noodles and meats on the side and the toppings neatly decorated on the bridge. After putting together the dish in this order of meat, noodles, then toppings, the dish tasted super fresh and healthy as everything paired well with the flavorful pork bone and chicken broth. It was quite a refreshing dish. The popcorn chicken is also good. I recommend eating that first before it gets cold as the main dish will remain hot due to the hot bowl it comes in.The staff was super attentive and kept coming back to make sure we were doing well. The waiter politely informed us on how to put together the dish. The waitress asked us how HER soup tasted, so I assumed the soup was her recipe and that she was one of the owners. I overheard that same waitress and waiter, who I assume is the other owner, boast about their Thai tea being the best in the Bay (not sure how true this is since I did not order it), and the waiter even told us about the popcorn chicken.The restaurant itself is kind of small and tight, so this restaurant may not be ideal for bigger parties. Overall though, loved the inside and the vibes of this place, and the food was super good! The man also convinced me to take the rest of my soup home, so I can pair it with whatever noodles at home since it would have been a waste to waste the good soup.', \"I like the broth, I like the variety of ingredients and the beef quality.   However I cannot give it more than 3 stars if I am still hungry after paying $25.  There is simply not enough protein included.  I would have to pay another $5 plus tax and tip to be satisfied.  I wasn't expecting to pay for more than $30 for yunnan noodles.  It's a good concept just overpriced.\", \"Everything here is so good.they boast the same quality of food. Their decor is more polished though, with sleek seating and cute irregular cloud mirrors along the walls. Parking can be an issue and they also don't take reservations, so plan your visit accordingly. I went with my family of four on a Saturday at 11:30am and were seated immediately, though the line got packed right after, with wait times up to 1.5 hours.Oodle Yunnan Rice Noodle was a very  great and good.I like  their service and also their food.The food was so delicious and  when I will back I will come here. The owners are clearly passionate about the food and the service.The owner is super nice as well.Service was attentive and the owner came to check in with us multiple times. I like it very much. Highly Recommended.Highly Recommended.\", \"We decided to try the new restaurant on Balboa Street called Oodles Yunan Rice Noodles. With such a cute name, how can you go wrong?I had the Chicken Rice Noodles and was impressed! The homemade bone broth was fragrant and delectable!!! The silken rice noodles had an excellent texture and was perfectly Al dente. The shredded chicken, fresh vegetables and accompaniments paired perfectly. I couldn't finish and took the leftover home. Hubby had the Hot and Sour Fish Fillet Rice Noodles. The homemade hot and sour pork bone broth was very tasty and the fish fillet and vegetables were nice and fresh. He thoroughly enjoyed it. His dish disappeared quickly. And he took a lot of my noodles. I also had the Fresh Lemon Bomb Green Tea with Aloe. It was very pleasant. I was worried that the lemon would have a drying after taste but it did not. Hubby had the Thai Me Around (classic Thai milk tea).The service was excellent. All the servers were extremely attentive and cordial. They provide instructions on which order to add the food into the soup. Great customer service!The restaurant is new, clean, organized and inviting. We will definitely return!\", 'Nice presentation but expect to be rushed through the whole thing. The original, the mala and the green peppercorn based were pretty good. Expect a wait before you can get a table. Overall though pretty decent yunnan over the bridge noodles.', \"Great service, Great drinks, Great slurps Stopped by for brunch and it did not disappoint! The service was very welcoming and attentive. You can tell that they really do value their customer's experience. Our server recommend the popcorn chicken as appetizer and it was on point. Meat was juicy with a crispy mild spicy crunch.I also tried the original crossing bridge rice noodle and it's honestly one of the best I've had. The broth isn't too bland or salty which makes it so appetizing to crave more. The owner also told me that they used to open a boba shop! I tried 2 of their fruit teas and they're both very refreshing and pairs perfect with steaming hot noodles. Overall, a great little spot for authentic Yunnan rice noodles!!\", \"Great place to eat on a cold day! We tried the  crossing bridge rice noodle and the fish fillet with pickled cabbage rice noodle. The broth is so flavorful and the rice noodles have a great texture. Also loved all the variety of small dishes that came on the bridge. The restaurant also serves boba drinks which is great if you want something sweet to go with your noodles. Service was great and staff was super friendly! The intertior is super aesthetic as well! Love that there's a new noodle restaurant in the Richmond and can't wait to come back!\", 'Great place for a \"different \" type of meal. Soup served naked and you put in the different ingredients to your liking. Very flavorful broth.  Very nice staff that explains the process to you. For a different place to go, this is the place!', 'Tried the #1 and #8 noodle soups.  Enjoyed #1 original better.  The ginger milk tea  was delicious.  The cucumber appetizer was yummy.  Friendly owner and staff.  Definitely will be back to try out other stuff.  New to come would be cold noodles and other stuff.  The fried buns with sweet condensed milk and ginger milk tea are not on the menu but should order.', \"We were craving for something soupy and found this on yelp and decided to give it a try. The store is not super obvious so we walked past it once or twice before going in. The server was friendly. He greeted us the moment we stepped in. We ordered the following: - #1 - Crossing Bridge Rice Noodle- #2 - Yunnan Spicy Small Pot Rice Noodle- D1 - Panda Milk Tea- S1 - Basil Popcorn ChickenMy friend said the Yunnan Spicy Small was pretty spicy so I didn't give it a try. The soup base for the Crossing Bridge feels pretty clean. We both really like the popcorn chicken. The server gave us some sweet and sour sauce to go with it. The Milk Tea feels OK. The server checks in on us every 5-10 mins so we feel really appreciated.\", \"I've been walking by this restaurant every day waiting to see when it would be opening and it's finally soft opening! I came here two days in a row during their soft opening because it's just that good! The bone broth here is delicious - you can tell there's no MSG added and it's very flavorful. My only complaint is that the portions of noodles are too small - at this price point, the noodle portions should be bigger.They're a bit short staffed at the moment and still ironing out the kinks, so the first day I went, they were busy and the service was slow, but the second day I went, service was extremely fast.\", \"A new restaurant just opened up in the outer Richmond! I believe we came for their soft opening and ordered the popcorn chicken to go. Hot, fresh, tasty and can't wait to come back to try their noodles.\", \"Went on a weekday night and most tables were full! It was a small restaurant with a cute aesthetic! Like how it was like picnic tables but i feel like if you were taller the tables might be bumping your legs. We got three different noodle bowls, the crossing bridge rice noodle (7.510) where it was very light and comforting. It came with think beef slices which you should dump into the hot soup. You should dip it right away so the meat can cook properly. We also got the sichuan spicy beef stew (8/10) where the beef stews was flavorful and wasn't tough to eat, the soup based tasted like mala. Lastly we got the tomato spam (7.5/10) which was not spicy even though it looks like it. It was light and the tomato flavor wasn't too strong! One thing was the service even though the food came out really fast, as we were kinda of finishing the workers were hovering and starting to ask if we want to take things away. We felt like we were getting kicked out, I understand it was getting a little busy but they way they approach us did not feel too good. When the check came and I was trying to pay the tip since I paid in cash, the coworker was hovering again and it felt super uncomfortable, I was not able to calculate right and end up a lot more than I wanted to.\", 'Had lunch at this place while in soft opening! The interior was aesthetic and the presentation of the food really up-ed the vibes. It was so fun to see the toppings on little bridges :-)Group of two ordered the Tomato Beef Brisket Rice Noodles and the Green Pepper Fish Fillet Rice Noodles + drinks. The tomato broth was flavorful and a great non-spicy soup. The beef was super tender and pulled apart easily. The Green Pepper Fish Fillet was super yummy as well and had a nice peppery kick to it. definitely recommend the Supreme Fruit Tea with mango popping boba; loved sipping it with my tomato rice noodles! The owners and servers were quick to take our orders and were very sweet! Will definitely come again after their grand opening to try some other dishes.', \"Very good food and great service!! The noodle bowls are unique with many condiments and don't miss out on the basil popcorn chicken!!\", \"I'm a sucker for flavorful bone broth and slippery noodles with a perfect chew, and Oodle really delivers. This is soul food for me. Service was warm and impeccable, felt so welcome and taken care of the crew. Love the bench seating arrangement. Love that Oodle made a home in my hood and really look  forward to visiting again.\", 'Tried this place out during its soft opening.  Overall service was fast, ambiance was very friendly and the food very tasty.  We ordered the lemon bomb aloe green tea drink at 30% sugar level-super refreshing; basil popcorn chicken with sweet & sour sauce was a nice appetizer with a hint of spice; the original soup noodle dish (#1 on the menu) and the chicken soup noodle dish-of the two, the chicken broth was the more concentrated and flavorful.  It was a fun experience getting to add ingredients into the (very hot) bowl.  Would come back!Pro tip-use the bathroom before you visit as their bathroom is very small and tucked in behind the kitchen.', \"overpriced. Me and my boyfriend both ordered 2 sets of noodles. We were super disappointed when it only came with 1 bridge to share. Also portions are small and super not filling. I looked at previous reviews and saw that people got 2 bridges when they ordered 2 noodles. I don't understand why we only got one.... My boyfriend even questioned if that was it and the waiter said that we were supposed to share. Honestly don't know how this place has such high ratings. I feel like its a copycat version of Ten Seconds, which in my opinion tastes way better\", \"Great noodle soup on Balboa! I came here with a friend on a Thursday around midday, and the place was fairly busy! There isn't a lot of seating, but there was a lot of turnover, so the wait wasn't too bad for anyone that walked in. I ordered the fish fillet rice noodle soup. I had to step out for a call while we were waiting for our food, and by the time I came back in, my food was already there, and it cooled down significantly. The server (I think the owner?) was SO nice and gracious, that she helped me heat my soup back up again so that I could enjoy my meal properly! I really appreciated that she was able to do that for me! The soup and toppings themselves was delicious, and I was glad that I could experience it nice and hot! I also got the Dragon fruit lychee smoothie and it was SO delicious that I ordered another one to bring home! The server/owner even suggested drinks that they could make that weren't on the menu, and I opted to also take a Hokkaido milk tea home as well! Overall, the service, food, and drinks were all amazing, and I will definitely be back to try more of their items!\", 'A very unique find in the whole Bay Area and I ran into it!  Amazing noodle with the right texture and no matter what flavor you order, the soup base is really out of this world.  Discovered they just opened 2 days ago but it feels like they have been making the same soup noodle for the past century.  Service is great and do not forget to order the Popcorn Chicken.，', \"It was a cold and rainy day and actually makes it perfect for a hot bowl of noodkes. I came before with a big group but this time came alone and that's when you can really taste the food. This time I wanted to try the tomato beef brisket noodle soup and this one is also very good. The beef brisket and the noodles were good but it was the soup that did it for me. Soup had a perfect blend of tomato and was flavorful and aromatic (without being salty). I also like their wooden tables and wooden utensils and decor. I am going to have to try their other variations and their boba.\", 'My craving for a nice comforting soup was answered. Unique flavor.

The soup for both were delicious with a lot of flavor and sat light in the mouth. It was not overwhelming with salt or msg and was easy to drink the entire soup if wanted! Everything tasted great. I was mostly surprised with how good the popcorn chicken and milk tea were. Popcorn chicken was juicy and seasoned nicely. The milk tea was very smooth and brewed with flavor. I waited 30 minutes for the boba as it wasn't ready since they just opened, but it was worth the wait!Overall great service and tasting food. It's worth checking out for a full meal or even just their drinks/snacks!\", \"The soup is boiled for 12 hours without MSG. There's different flavors of soup base. Their boba drinks are amazing too. I had the silky smooth Thai milk tea and Hong Kong milk tea with ginger. Both tasted amazing. Service is good too. Also, try their homemade hot sauce. It does get a little busy on cold days so be prepared for\\xa0a\\xa0short\\xa0wait.\", \"I've been on the search for a GOOD Crossing Bridge noodle restaurant since I moved to SF in 3rd grade, and I am so happy that I've finally found THE restaurant. The quality of the broth is rich and flavorful, yet not too heavy. You can tell they used high-quality ingredients and cooked the broth for hours. I finished the whole bowl of soup without needing to drink any water! The only thing I'd like them to improve on is their portion sizes. For almost 20 dollars a bowl, you only get around 6 small pieces of beef, and I was sadly not full after my meal. Lastly, the service is great! The staff is very attentive and warmly engages with each customer.Can't wait to visit again soon!! Overall: 4.5/5\", \"Pros: - Exceptional tasty soup(s). We tried the original (1) and hot & sour (3). They're the best I had in the Bay Area. It was so tasty that I asked them to pack our leftover soup to go. - Smooth rice noodles. They're so light and smooth. Again, the best I had in the Bay Area. - Unparalleled service. The lady boss is so nice and professional. She took the initiative to greet and introduce their menu to anyone who would be unfamiliar with Yunnan rice noodles. She checked on every table to make sure everything was fine. The rest of the servers were very attentive as well. - Their popcorn chicken is near top-notch.Cons (nitpick for a soft opening): - Servers need better training. Except for the bosses, the rest of the servers were pretty lost. They're attentive no doubt, but they kept on making mistakes (appreciate the apologetic attitude) and they can use a softer tone when it comes to communication. I understand, that hiring food service workers is hard these days.  - Serving size. We're small eaters and we ended up ordering an app to feel full. It would take a double noodles serving for an average guy. Similar to Reman joints in Japan, a second serving of noodles for free (or a small charge like $1)  would be nice.  -  Not a con necessary. The bench is not very comfortable to sit for a longer time. We typically finish our meals in under 45 minutes in a noodles shop. I get it that the hall won't fit 6 tables if chairs are being used. There is no problem for us, just come to think about others.It was soft opening day #5 and it was pretty amazing. I was skeptical when I saw the 5-star reviews. OK, confirmed that it's a 5-star kinda good for a new restaurant. We'll definitely come back.\"]\n",

      "Reviews: ['The best restaurant in San Francisco. Cook knows his job   and he is so talented. Everything is amazing. Foods are amazing that took me to İstanbul.', \"Bistro Ember is one of our new favorite neighborhood spots. Every single dish totally blew us away and you can tell the chef put a lot of thought into the detail and presentation of each plate. We started with amazing fried chickpea bread served w/butter stunningly shaped as a honeycomb. The Manti Dumplings were filled with a savory lamb and beef mixture and served in a rich, oak-smoked yogurt sauce, and the Turkish Tagliatelle was tossed w/tender grilled chicken and a nutty, fragrant antep pistachio pesto. The 12-hr Slow Cooked Lamb Shank was filled w/flavor and just melted off the bone. For dessert, our Turkish Coffee Cake was moist and chocolatey w/a coffee sauce poured over, and the Burnt Chicken Pudding was a delightful surprise - a rich & creamy pudding w/goat cheese ice cream, cinnamon crumble and topped with a candied piece of crispy chicken skin. The ambiance was so elegant and cozy w/warm, exposed brick walls. I definitely recommend this place looking for a nice dinner and can't wait to come back to try their weekend brunch.\", \"Absolutely delicious, elegant, and friendly here. There are so many great things to try on the brunch and dinner menus.Try the Traditional Turkish Breakfast!  The staff are extremely friendly and very good at walking you through the different items on the menu.The decor is lovely as well.   You feel like you are in an exclusive lounge. Can't wait to come back!\", \"My husband and I honeymooned in Turkey so we were SO excited to see Ember open near us, and decided to try it for our 15th anniversary dinner. In our reservation, we asked to be seated in a quieter area away from large parties. Unfortunately, when we arrived - it was midweek - we found the restaurant to be ear-splittingly loud. And we were offered a table by a party of 18 :-(  To their credit, the staff tried to accommodate us by offering a table farther away from the large party (if we were willing to wait 15 or 20 minutes) but it wasn't going to be much quieter there. We walked away sadly, and were lucky to find a table at a quieter restaurant in the neighborhood.  I wish the designers of Ember gave more thought to acoustics (I didn't see any of those sound panels on the ceiling for instance). Or maybe they want to discourage diners over 40?  The menu looks so interesting and the space is beautiful, so we hope to try it another time, as long as we don't have to shout to be heard.\", 'As you enter this establishment...in one of the quaintest neighborhoods in SF...a warm glowing fireplace greets you.  The restaurant style is cozy and stylish with great aesthetics.  The staff was superb with attentiveness.  The menu is small in choices but packed with delicious choices, flavors and tastes.  We enjoyed all our dishes...the bread was so yummy, the salads flavor-filled with freshness and brightness.  The entrees...the tagliatelle with grilled chicken, the fillet and the lamb shank...winning.  We tried two desserts...the chocolate cake with Turkish coffee a definite table pleaser.  We all are still raving over our meals.  Bravo!!!', \"Wow! What a gem in the Mission District that provides an upscale exploration into Turkish cuisine. I am guilty of not trying many Turkish dishes in the past, but after a night at Bistro Ember I am now sold. Aside from the rock star dishes, which I'll go more into detail in a bit, the service is stellar. As cliche as this may sound, you can feel the blood, sweat and tears put into the restaurant. Each worker has a huge smile and describes each dish with pride and passion. Most notably for our dessert course, the pastry chef came out to present the dish and had so much happiness as he was describing how to eat it. The staff definitely deserves five stars for providing such high level service. Now, to the part you are all here for: THE FOOD! Our personal favorites were the Turkish Tartare, Chickpea Yeast Bread, Lamb Mutancana and Chicken Pudding. Wow was that tartare packed with flavor. It was a mix of Kofte (Turkish meatball) and tenderloin. Man, I am not sure what spice was in the dish but it was so tasty. I could eat an entire plate on my own. Regarding the bread...it was so good! Fluffy, warm and paired exceptionally with the butter. It had great bounce and you couldn't even notice it was made out of chick peas. Now to the lamb...so tender paired with a smooth and luscious keskek (a Turkish risotto)! The sauce was silky and we licked every last bit of it up. Finally, the pudding. This was a perfect ending to our dinner! It had such a nutty flavor, and you couldn't even tell there was chicken in the dish at all. The goat cheese ice cream had an amazing tang that cut the savoriness of the pudding. Overall, amazing service and tasty dishes! You need to try this place out if you're in the mood for a Turkish meal.\", \"Every morsel and bite we had was delicious! We started with a cold appetizer: Fish and Raki. Raki is the national drink of Turkey and it's twice distilled grapes. It was light and perfect for summer.Then came the piping HOT yeast bread and our hot appetizer - the couscous. The couscous was my favorite dish because of the spring onion and basil purées that are incorporated into the dish.For a entrée, we had the Lamb Mutancana, which was tender, moist and flavorful. It is perhaps the most traditional Turkish dish on the menu but it was nice to have a traditional component to an otherwise very contemporary and innovative menu.Wait, we also had coffee and dessert! We couldn't resist trying the Burnt Chicken skin pudding. It was very unique and equally delicious.The service and the wait staff were perfect. There was ample parking outside on a Saturday night. The place is brand new and well turned out. It was quiet so we could hear each other talk, but it wasn't too quiet. We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and would go back again in a heartbeat.\", \"This review is for brunch only.  I had to make a last minute reservation change to increase our large party size, so I called and the restaurant was so accommodating!  They even were nice enough to let us push the time a bit.  This place has a good ambiance.  The omelets were huge.  I ordered a Turkish coffee to try it... but didn't realize it comes the size of an espresso, albeit in an elegant tea cup set, lol.  Got to savor my three sips with pinkie up of course.  Though brief, the bold dark roast was quite enjoyable.  I would love to come back and try the dinner menu which looks much more interesting!\", \"This is a perfect place for a cozy dinner.  The food is delicious, the service charming and friendly, and the restaurant is very pretty.We started with the chickpea bread, which came with adorable butter, shaped like a honeycomb. the little holes were full of delicious seasoned oils.The Manti (from my mom) were my favorite.  little meat-filled dumplings on top of tomato sauce and yogurt.For mains, our table got the salmon, filet and lamb shank.  Everything was well-made and tasty but the lamb shank (recommended by our waiter) was a standout.My husband thought the Turkish coffeee cake was one of the best desserts he's had in awhile.We'll definitely be back!\", 'My fiancé and I were able to snag a reservation to try out Bistro Ember during their first week of opening. The waiters and staff were very professional and attentive.  Understandably since it was their opening week, the wait was a bit longer than expected. Dishes we had:EMBER OYSTER - I got 6 of their oysters which were very fresh and light. Love the sauce that accompany them.TURKISH TARTARE - fun rendition of steak tartare with a Turkish flare. I thought it was good. Personally, when the kofte and tartare were  all mixed together, that usual tartare texture got lost a little. EMBER OCTOPUS - the octopus was nicely seasoned and perfectly cooked. The sauce it came with brought it together.COUSCOUS - delicious dish! It ended up being my entrée and I really enjoyed it. The calamari dolmas were very tasty and they went well with the basil purée. LAMB MUTACANA - the cooked lamb shoulder was good and it paired well with the mushrooms and keske (resembles a little to mashed potatoes). However, not a fan of the anise and plum purées. They felt too sweet and overpowering. For dessert, we shared the TURKISH COFFEE CAKE. Solid dessert and the star of this dish was actually the berries sorbet. Overall, our meal was very tasty and the plating of each dish we had was beautiful and seems intentional. They also have a decent wine selection to choose from.The restaurant is cozy and the decor is beautiful. I would recommend everyone to check them out!Congratulations on opening in Noe ! Wishing the team at Bistro Ember all the best!', 'Fabulous and cozy, Ember is a number one date night or special occasion eatery. Don\\'t let the \"Bistro\" fool you. This place has top-notch food and service. We had grilled octopus, seared ahi, Seabass and pasta. They served an amazing  dessert to my birthday wife and took care of us the whole time. Highly recommended.', 'When we saw the new signage a couple months ago for this restaurant, we were keen to give it a try. We really enjoyed the restaurant that was previously in this space, so we had high hopes that this would be another \"Go To\". Bistro Ember is a solid restaurant! As it\\'s in its infancy, there are a couple things that need improvement, but overall we were very pleased with the food and the service was very good. First off, the remodel of the space is very elegant... not pretentious in anyway, but definitely sets the tone that this is a \"fine dining\" experience. Bringing our 3 y/o boys might have been a mistake as the atmosphere isn\\'t conducive to kids, but the staff were so nice to them, as rowdy as they can be. The only knocks we had was that the portions are small for the prices charged and that the wine list is a bit limited, Overall, the food is very good and the experience of dining here is very pleasant. There\\'s room for improvement, and that should be viewed optimistically.', 'Good restaurant in Noe Valley. Interesting food options and nice atmosphere. Especially enjoyed the octopods', \"Octopus 4 starsSquash Blossoms All the starsTurkish Manti 4 starsRavioli - Divine!Ate at Ember Bistro this weekend. This is easily the most exciting restaurant I have been to in years. I can't wait to return. Everything was stellar. Bring your friends!\", 'Walked by this place on a Tuesday night, decided to give it a try. The restaurant was pretty full around 7pm. It\\'s a little crowded due to the layout and can be hard to talk or hear conversations. We didn\\'t have a reservation but they were able to sit us in a few minutes. Our table was wobbly so I asked the waiter to help. He said, \"let me check with my manager.\" I was in a bit of a shock since my request was a simple one. I don\\'t know if he was new or nervous but after he said that I was going to just fix it myself. Anyway, after waiting for about 15 minutes finally another waiter came by and tried to put something under the table. It didn\\'t completely stop the wobbling so my date had to fix it himself. It took awhile for the water and food to arrive. We ordered the sea bass and octopus. Both were over cooked. The octopus was tough and charred, and sea bass was dry. Flavor wise they were both very tasty and the presentation was done well. There were a lot of waiters that evening (5-6) which should be sufficient but the service was very slow. I think they need to have better training. It\\'s still relatively new so I am hoping the service and food quality would improve over time.', 'A wonderful Neighborhood Restaurant with relaxing Ambience friendly service and delicious food. Everything we ordered was delicious from the tartar to the eggplant to  the scallops and the two desserts.  Nice wine by the glass selection too.  What more could you ask for?', 'The food was delicious. Every single item that we ordered was done really well and presentation of food was impressive.Service was quick and friendly. Loved the ambiance.', \"An astonishing, delicious meal at Bistro Ember, which has taken over a former Burmese restaurant. The dishes are billed as Mediterranean but there was a strong Turkish undertone to our selections. We started with the Fish & Raki salad, a refreshing combination of sweet melons and finely sliced kampachi. Our main course were the fried squash blossoms and grilled octopus tentacles. Both were delicious, with each ingredient not overpowering but complimenting the whole. We chose the burnt chicken skin pudding for dessert. I've had chicken cooked as dessert in Turkey and was delighted to see it on the menu. The portion for each dish is constrained - we much prefer this to the massive pile-up served in many restaurants. We look forward to returning and trying other items on the menu.\", \"A very special spot with warm and friendly service. Chef Deniz has brought the best of Mediterranean cuisine yet with a creative Californian touch. We had the Tomato & Watermelon, Little Gem Salad, and Fish and Raki as starters. All starters were spectacular. I had Manti as my entree and it was even better than my grandma's! The wine list was featuring a great selection of both red and white wine from different regions. Overall, Bistro Ember is our favorite spot\", 'This place is so good!  I went with my friend who knows the chef or owner.  The food presentation was so good, the service was very attentive and the food was also very good, lots of variety and great portions, not too big or small!

I would highly recommend for a nice dining experience.', 'My second time at Bistro Ember did not disappoint! Their brunch menu is more than what I was looking for. We ordered the Turkish breakfast for two, Shaksuka, Simit and Pancakes (to start!). I must say locally sourced produce made a huge difference- everything tasted super fresh.

The cheese borek were very tasty and the sangrias were fresh and delicious. 5 out of 5', \"Deniz is an excellent and creative chef. You'll enjoy the experience there. The food is delicious and also very creative. The chicken desert is not really chicken. Thats a spoiler.\", 'Absolutely wonderful. We went right at 5 with our 21 month old. They were so accommodating and sweet to her. The food was amazing. The watermelon salad paired with the chickpea bread is a must. The butter presentation alone was worth it.Squash blossoms and grilled octopus were a delight. So many deep flavors. I could eat 10 fried squash blossoms and still want more. dessert was a delight. When our daughter had a taste, she melted in my arms and swooned. Such a sweet place, we will be back!', 'Although we saw great reviews in the press, we were really motivated to go to EMBER based on the recommendation of a foodie friend. Rarely do we leave a restaurant thinking everything was 100% perfect but we definitely felt 100% satisfied at EMBER. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful with everything from the banquettes to the bathroom in pristine condition and pleasing to the eye. We wanted to order everything on the menu but decided to follow the suggestions of Emir who guided us towards his recommendations. We were not disappointed with anything we ordered. The wine list was complete with a wide variety of options. The sauvignon blanc we ordered was delicious. If we had to pick one word to describe our experience, it would be --- flawless.', \"Upscale Mediterranean with very good food and service.  Our party tried 5 different starters to share.  All were unique, and delicious.  The beet salad was my favorite.  Our main courses were also amazing.  The eggplant was so tasty, and the lamb portion was hearty and perfectly seasoned.  All our dishes were presented beautifully on the plates.  Now let's talk dessert.  The Baklava was some of the best I've ever tasted and it was accompanied with an ice cream that vanilla heaven.  The Turkish coffee cake was also wonderful.  I really enjoyed the decor of the restaurant...very pleasing to the eyes.  The chairs were so comfortable and it has a cozy vibe.  I would definitely go back for the beet salad, manti and the eggplant entree, but saving room for the baklava.\", 'Ambience, food and service deserve a five star.  W e have been Bistro Ember twice and looking forward to our third visit soon.', \"Beautiful interior and outstanding service! Food was excellent, especially the green couscous and that divine lamb dish. I noticed a delicious, sultry umami flavor in these dishes whose delicate and balanced approach I've only ever encountered before in Japanese cuisine. Superb! The only reason for 4 stars is the lamb portion was quite small for the price\", 'Great food great and kind service. Good addition to the Noe dining scene. The couscous was bomb! My only recommendation is to hire an additional server, as when the restaurant was full there were only 2 servers. Dessert good as well, though took a bit to come out from the kitchen.', \"Terrific service, wonderful comforting food (slow-cooked lamb, polenta, etc.) from one of my favorite parts of the world, and perhaps the worst pinot noir I've ever had. Go and eat and unbutton the top button of your pants.\", \"We were excited to try this place. Their menu looks amazing. Unfortunately, their service was insanely bad. We were seated for like 20 minutes and still hadn't received a menu or got any attention from a waiter. Add on top of that that the restaurant is incredibly cramped and loud, we decided to bail. Maybe we will give them a second chance, but also there are so many amazing places nearby that actually have good service.\", 'Lovely place with good , distinctive menu and great service.  Portions are on the small side but very tasty.', \"We live in Noe, and finally got a chance to dine at Bistro Ember tonight after walking past with curiousity for the last few weeks. We were blown away by how interesting and delicious every bite was, from the yeasty bread rolls with a lovely mold of honeyed butter to the manti in an exquisite broth to the incredible chicken pudding dessert. Everyone at Ember was super warm and welcoming, and the space is lovely. We're so pleased to have them in the neighborhood and are eager to return soon.\", 'Food is fantastic and so inventive, what a chef! All food represented for vegetarian, pescatarian and carnivores.

We had the traditional Turkish breakfast for two.', 'We discovered Bistro Ember tonight while going on an evening stroll in Noe Valley.  What a wonderful find in our local neighborhood.  Only open about 1 month, the food & service were outstanding.  The food was beautiful, delicious & paced in a timidly manner.

      "Reviews: [\"We made a reservation on Yelp and were seated when we arrived. We ordered the following for 2 people and it was just enough because the portions were pretty small. (The waiter thought we order too much lol). - Korean Steak Tartare - it's okay. Nothing special. - Uni Scallop Toast - pretty good but it's $18 per order! The scallop was sweet. -Galbi Ribeye with lettuce - it cost extra if you add the lettuce. But the galbi was really good, highly recommend this. -Kimchi Fried Rice - it was good but you cannot taste the kimchi. Remember to pop the egg yolk when it comes out !-Kimchi Oysters - it's okay. Nothing special. -Sunchoke & Truffle - 3 types of mushroom cooked in truffle oil. Highly recommend. Love the diff mushrooms textures. -Mulhwe Noodle - raw dish in fermented chili broth. Must get. It wasn't spicy and very refreshing. Overall, I would come back again for other tapas and it wasn't too expensive.\", \"This restaurant has been on my food bucket list for a while and I finally got to try it last week. I will say I was slightly underwhelmed because I had higher expectations given Bansang is Michelin recommended bib gourmand. The dishes are meant to be shared family style and our waiter recommended 2-3 dishes per person for our party of 3 depending on how hungry we were. They served two bon chon dishes which was a green tomato kimchi and a cucumber salad. Off the menu, we ordered the:*caviar and mochi blini: the caviar tasted a little more fishy and salty than some I've had before. This dish was aesthetic, but I wouldn't feel the need to try it again*sunchoke and matsutake: probably one of the best tasting items we ordered. The combination of mushrooms and sauce were creamy and savory*korean steak tartare*mulhwe noodle: the noodles were refreshing and not too heavy. Presentation wise, it was enjoyable to watch the server pour the sauce onto the noodles *jang cream pasta: unremarkable, I would pass on this. The mushroom cream was really mild and I feel as though I could've made better pasta at home*galbi ny strip: must order! The marinade from the galbi combined with the various sauces were delicious We also ordered cocktails-- the son of a peach (peach negroni) and the yujamong (grapefruit soju). They both barely tasted alcoholic, but were sweet and tasty. I will say the playlist that night was poppin' as they were playing 90s/00s RnB. If I could give it a 3.5/5, I would. For price point and taste, it wasn't anything out of the ordinary.\", \"Had dinner here on a Saturday night and would rate the place a 3.5/5-Parking was somewhat challenging to find but not impossible as it took about 10-15 minutes. It's mostly metered parking but meter ends at a certain time so you don't have to worry about it over dinner-I would definitely recommend making reservations because they get quite busy. One time I tried to do a drop in and the host was kind enough to get my cell number and call me if there is a last minute cancellation but advised it could be an hour wait. The second time, I already had a reservation and asked if it is possible to get seated early if there is an opening. This time it was another host and he gave off an odd vibe. He refused to let me know if an earlier opening came up. He even cut me off mid conversation, telling me it is not possible at all. It was definitely an impressionable moment but I tried to not let it affect my dining experience.Other than that experience with that specific host, the service was good. The waitress checked up on us occasionally to see if we needed anything. As far as the food, I would definitely recommend the following-ankimo and quail egg: 5/5 very creamy and flavorful, surprising a good complex mix-jang cream pasta: 4/5 pasta was cooked al dente and was so good -lime soy fried chicken: 4/5 if you love citrus, would recommend this as there was a huge burst of citrus with this dishAs for the other dishes we ordered, I thought these were ok:-the uni from the uni scallop toast wasn't as fresh and had a bitter after taste so didn't think it was worth $27 and would give it a 3/5-Korean steak tartare didn't seem as fresh either so would give it a 3/5I did like the ambiance as it was lively with a touch of industrial design and wood tones. It would be a good spot to casually check out with a group of friends or date night but definitely make reservations\", \"The influencers and the gram sure hyped me up for this place.  I came here with my friends back in May and this is how much i've hesitated to review this place. We were fortunate enough for them to seat us as our remaining friend was making their way here.   We started out with the Hulhwe Noodles, which was actually a lighter dish.  It was a refreshing dish, but it didn't wow us.   What did wow us was the sunchoke and truffles. We kept on digging at this dish and this dish will show to be the highlight of the night. The uni toast was supposed to be the star of the show, but the uni wasn't fresh. I actually wanted to recall a dish for the first time in my life.  It looked amazing but you can tell the uni wasn't from the same day.  At least to us we didn't find it fresh at all, and we were completely disappointed at this point.The kimchi and radish fried rice was just so-so to us.  I think they needed that poach egg to make this dish work. Without it it would've been so bland. The Galbi NY steak was my next disappointment.  I didn't find the steak to be tender enough as i needed water to wash down my food.  It was so hard to digest this dish. However, them pairing it with three different salts worked well.. There was no way i would've continued eating that without it. The only highlight of the night was really the sunchokes.  It was light and refreshing and it went well with the added crisp they added For dessert we got the soy milk canele, i did enjoy this one as it wasn't too sweet but it didn't blow me out of the water as i find the trader joe's one might be even better.  I'm sorry Bansang didn't work out for me, i wish them the best, as i can see a lot of others enjoyed them.\", \"We had a wonderful anniversary dinner here. The food is so beautifully done and we enjoyed everything we tried. It was hard to decide what to order because the whole menu sounded amazing. I appreciated our servers recommendations. I would definitely suggest the gochujang black cod. The setting is simple but nice, a little dark.  The seats are a bit close together since it's a smaller restaurant. I would come again though, hopefully soon.\", \"Service and ambiance - 5/5We had reservations as we were celebrating a friend's birthday. Hostess was very nice and waiters were attentive. They even gave my friend a special menu for her birthday. The restaurant feels fancy but still casual. The interior is spacious and tables are not cramped. Food - 3.5/5They expect you to share the dishes family style so I'd recommend going with at least 1 or 2 others to make sure you can order more dishes to share. It also helps because I found many of the dishes too heavy for one person. - uni scallop toast - I love milk toast but it took away from the uni and scallop which should've been the stars of this dish. Very pretty and would recommend to try once but I don't think I'd order it again. Each order comes with one piece that's recommended for 2 people. - Korean steak tartare - this is different than the traditional Korean tartare, yukhoe. This was a dish with small chunks of steak and more savory (even to the point of being too salty at the end). I liked this version but definitely recommend it to be shared. - squashini pancake - another dish that came out differently than expected. Different than the traditional Korean squash/zucchini pancake, this was a more ordinary pancake dressed with some shrimp and sauce for flavor. I didn't get squash or zucchini flavor. Another item that I'd skip. - sunchoke + truffle - the biggest surprise for us. This was a dish that we didn't expect to like as much as we did. The rich, earthy mushroom flavor was amazing. However, this is another dish I'd recommend sharing because it was really rich with the mushroom cream base.  Very tasty though!- mulhwe noodle - like hwe-naengmyeon but less intense. Very small portion compared to a normal bowl of naengmyeon so it left me kinda wanting more. I liked it though and found it very refreshing. - miso marinated pork - the pork was well-cooked and very tender, however, the dish was a tad bit overly salty. The miso sauce and mushroom cream worked pretty well together giving the dish a rich, intense flavor but I'd skip it because it wasn't any spectacular. The only dishes I truly liked and would recommend were the Korean steak tartare and sunchoke + truffle. 3.5 stars for food and 5 stars for ambiance so overall rating of 4 stars.\", 'We came for a Saturday night dinner with no reservation and waited about 30-45 minutes to get seated. We were able to leave our number for them to call when our table was ready. Our server gave us great recommendations and we ended up sharing the uni scallop toast, the galbi ribeye, and the chocolate cake for dessert. Everything was so delicious! There was so much flavor in all the dishes. Definitely want to come back and try out more of the other tapas.', \"I came to Bansang for a birthday celebration. Located right off Geary Boulevard, this place is really cute. Their menu features small and large Korean tapas. We ordered the truffle quail egg skewers, fried chicken, and tuna tartare for small tapas and the ribeye, pasta, fried rice, mulwhe noodle for the large tapas. Honestly everything was delicious. My favorites were the ribeye, which was super tender and paired with some sides and sauces. The pasta was also yummy - it was creamy with peas which added another layer of texture. Our servers were also really patient with us as we were slow to start ordering haha. They also brought out a small slice of carrot cake for my friend's birthday!I would definitely come here again the next time I'm in town.\", \"It's a rare occurrence when every single bite of every dish puts a huge cheesy smile on my face. Bansang did that to me. Bansang serves up Korean fusion dishes, and I've seen some restaurants lazily slap together two different dishes and call it fusion. This wasn't the case at all as each dish utilized fresh ingredients that just meshed together well. I have to mention that the steamed egg and caviar was one of the best things I've ever had! The egg was silky, and the potato crunch bits added another layer of texture. The lime soy chicken was a flavor of wings I've never had, it was sweet, salty, spicy, and I enjoyed it with a cold beer. I also have to shoutout the soy milk canelé for dessert. The citrus confit was a nice twist to the traditional canelé. Lightly sweet dessert to end the meal. Servers were helpful with recommendations and great to chat with. The restaurant inside is clean and modern, yet cozy. It's perfect for a date night or catching up with some friends.\", \"Solid place! My friend and I came here to celebrate our birthdays and it did not disappoint. The service was great and the food was yummy. Overall, would highly recommend. We started off with the uni toast, which was so creamy and yummy. It was a perfect bite for us two to split (they gave us a fork and a knife too to properly cut/share). The uni was super fresh! Then, we had the fried chicken, which was good but not amazing. Super tasty like sauce which was different than what I'm used too. But I wouldn't need to order again if I came back. For the main courses, we got the pasta and the black cod. The pasta was great! The sauce was super creamy and they gave us a lot of mushrooms. The black cod was the best thing we ate out of the whole mean in my opinion. They cooked the fish perfectly so it was buttery. Highly recommend ordering it!Would come again and try the ribeye! It was a great treat yourself meal.\", 'When I took in the Silicon Valley minimalist interior I had this sinking feeling this would be a spot for American Express Black cards and expense accounts. I was not wrong.Service was nearly silent, almost reverent - and uncomfortable. It was in opposition to the casual friendliness of the manager who was bubbly. Hey, I\\'ll go with the flow, just don\\'t change the river\\'s direction, mmkay?The food was overpriced and bland especially the Galbi ($52) with some pretty, overpriced leaves ($5) they called \"lettuce wraps\". Dry leaves. Pretty leaves. But come on, it was already a $52 entree for dry slices of beef.The Miso Marinated Pork ($25) was the breakaway winner and a dish I could eat every day. The sauce was so savory and divine I felt regret when they took away the plate.We also had the Hwe Ssam and Lime Soy Fried Chicken small tapas, neither memorable. We split the Soy Milk Canele ($12) for dessert and the citrus confit was a beautiful counterpoint to the rich crème Anglaise. Expensive and just okay with schizophrenic service (pick a mood). That said, every table was full, the only space the swanky glass-walled private dining room.I bet they have an option to opaque the glass in case Mr. X rolls in, worth an advance call to check. $100/person without alcohol.', \"A real treat to drop in, get seated at the bar, and be serviced so quickly and professionally.  At the bar, I loved watching the chefs' teamwork with each other and the front staff - really impressive!Comfy decor, unique fusion dishes.  We ordered a tangy not too spicy Kimchi Oysters, which was super fresh.  Uni Scallop Toast was bitefuls of flavor explosions, but is quite pricey.  Hwe Ssam is a delectable yellowtail tartare to be eaten on endive or sesame leaves. The Yuma pear salad was really good, but nothing to scream about.  Everything came out very quickly, but we waited a long time for the Jang Cream Pasta, which had buttery flavor profiles of umami mushrooms, sweet peas and Al dente rigatoni - well worth the wait!For dessert, I ordered the soy milk canele.  Too tough to cut and too big to bite into; the creme was delicious though.  Smack dab on busy Fillmore street, a great place for an enjoyable dinner with impeccable service.\", 'the prices here may be steep, but you pay for the amazing service, meticulously-crafted plates, and profound flavors. I love korean food but this takes that up by a notch by fusing complex flavors. definitely come in a group so you can try as many tapas as possible. we tried about half the entire menu but my favorites were the uni scallop toast, miso marinated pork, and mulhwe noodle.', 'A fun (and fast) foodie fusion experience! Will definitely come back to try their meat dishes.Would highly recommend their beef tartare, Ankimo dish, and', \"I had been wanting to try Bansang for a while and decided to come here with a few friends for my birthday. Bansang does small dishes so it's more fun to come with a few people so you can try more dishes. As most modern Korean places are, it is on the pricier side - I would say the food is more like a 3.75 but rounding up to a 4 for the overall experience :)We shared the mulhwe noodle, fried chicken, beef tartare, squash pancake, miso marinated pork and radish kimchi fried rice. Everything was pretty tasty! I particularly liked the mulhwe noodles, fried chicken and miso marinated pork. The pork was tender and I loved the crispy kale and sauce that paired with it. Since we were celebrating a birthday, they kindly brought out their chocolate cake with a candle on top. I loved the pistachio and matcha flavors (not so much the caramel haha).\", 'Recently earning the Michelin Bib Gourmand title of \"best value for money,\" Bansang surely needs no introduction. Their long wait times compounded with countless features in Instagram influencer reels speaks volumes for their growing popularity. After a day in SF, it would be remiss of anyone to not end their day at Bansang. Their cuisine is best explained by Korean tapas as almost every dish (with the exception of a few mains) is a small plate with immense flavor. They genuinely have the best fried chicken wings I\\'ve ever had, and it can easily be split among 2 or 3. While the uni and tuna toasts are flagship dishes, you\\'re not missing out if you don\\'t order them for the uni quality is just decent and the overall flavor just okay. Definitely try the pork though! It comes atop a savory cabbage purée and is lightly dressed in soy butter. Though some dishes are better than others, everything is delicious and pretty decently priced for the quality you receive. If you come to celebrate a birthday, the kind waitstaff serve you free dessert with a cute candle on the side! With such friendly waiters, romantic atmosphere, and miracle workers (posing as chefs), you won\\'t be disappointed with your Bansang experience.', \"Very happy with my husband's birthday dinner at Bansang. The food was amazing and service was very helpful and friendly. We loved everything ordered; the flavor combinations in each dish were delicious. We had a hard time deciding what to order and how much; our server was spot on with her recommendations. The restaurant space is very pretty and open - tables are spaced apart nicely so you don't feel cramped in at all.\", \"I've heard a lot of good things about Bansang before finally having the chance to try it!Bansang is very much known for putting a new spin on traditional Korean dishes and is apparently also a huge date spot. Great vibes, a decently sized menu consisting of various items of tapas, large tapas, and desserts, many of which contain elements of traditional Korean cuisine, for example, Korean pancakes, cold noodles, rice cakes, etc.The waitress recommended getting 3-4 tapas and 2 large tapas between two people. I really liked the presentation of the dishes and the creative elements in them. Would come back!\", \"Make sure you make a resy prior to dining here. One time we came with our friends and was hoping we would be able to get a table for 6. They said you'd have to make a resy a few days prior. Learned our lesson! My partner and I came and ordered their caviar toast,Cod, kimchi oysters, rigatoni with mushrooms, and their seafood pancake. What stood out to me was the cod and pasta. It was well executed, pasta cooked perfect, perfectly cooked mushrooms and perfectly seasoned. Same with their fish. The kimchi pancake was just ok. It lacked oomf. I thought it was lacking the crunch, the kimchi taste. The oysters were ok however nothing special. The banchans were ok too. I was comparing to San ho wan and wanted more options for their ban Chan. However it was very basic. Just pickled cucumbers and some sort of pickled tomatoes. We also ordered the lemon drop and an ipa beer. Both of which tasted great. All in all, would recommend checking this place out!\", 'Absolutely loved my experience here! Service was amazing and the food was very delicious! My favorite was the cod & fried chicken - both packed with flavor. My husband and I came for our anniversary and they even treated us to a glass of bubbly to celebrate!', \"Our bffs bday dinner at Bansang and NOIICE choice to celebrate it in! Firstly, all the servers looked like they just stepped out of a movie set, everyone here is gorgeous!!! Our female server was soooo sweet and accommodating, checked on us throughout the night, and couldn't be more personable! Food was beautifully prepared from start to finish. Flavors were tantalizing...Korean base w/ homemade smoked gochujang notes, hints of gochugaru color and flavor; each dish was also infused w/ a skoch of Spanish influences w/ chorizo and tapa plates. I think that's what tricked my brain a bit...the idea of Korean family style large portions executed in small tapa plates. I wanted more but seemingly full-ish w/ the bountiful green tomato kimchi and cold-cucumber Banchan which I partook and partook and partook in. All awhile sharing the plates we ordered with each dish fancier and distinctively delectable then the next. We managed to order and taste all we can between 6 adults and 1 kid and did fairly well, but also we wanted more but too shy to order more as to not look overly-famished. But all in all a wonderful birthday meal for the bff. I supposed my kid and I do better w/ hole in the walls, then fancy Michelin recommended restus...we do respect the culinary impression the chef has left on each plate and we applause their hard work. Kamsamnida / Muy Gracias!\", \"Tapas AND Korean food?! Fine fusion so sign me up. Been reading about how Bansang is hot, upcoming and  michelin worthy. So I decided to do a walk in while in the area on a Thursday night (and because reservations were booked out.)The staff is friendly and very accommodating! They wanted us to be seated so they did some rearranging so that we would have a table. Throughout the entire meal, we were being checked on with the kindest bussers. I ordered: Uni toast, Ankimo & Quail egg, Gamja Jorim, Sunchoke & Truffle, Mulhwe NoodleThe presentation of each dish was gorgeous. My favorite was the presenting of Mulhwe Noodle as they pour the sauce for you. Also, THIS was my favorite dish. The sea bream was delicious in the sauce. Uni scallop toast was kind of a let down for me. There was a lot of hype around this dish... but it was not that great. There was too much of the toast flavor that I lost the uni and scallop specialness. Really sad because I wanted to like this dish, but didn't.The sunchoke & truffle was my second favorite. Tons of texture and flavor. Everything else was just... ok. Ambiance is stunning with the wooden feel interior. I loved the gold silverware.Would love to come back if ever to try other things!\", \"This restaurant and their food are so aesthetically pleasing to the eye. I've been meaning to try this place for a while, but finally got to it! Had no problem making a reservation online for a Saturday night just the day beforehand.If you want to try multiple items from here I would recommend going with a group so you can all share. The portions aren't too big since it is tapas style. For the food, get the miso marinated pork! This was soo juicy and tender with just the perfect amount of miso. I also really liked the mulwhe noodles. The fish in this dish was so good and buttery and the cold noodles with it were so refreshing. The kimchi fried rice is also a great pick for a large tapa if you want something a bit more filling. Had a really nice crunch to it!I also got the uni scallop toast, which I think is worth getting! I tried the kimchi oysters and korean steak tartare too, but they weren't at the top of my list. They do bring out a slice of chocolate cake topped with matcha for birthdays here. It's a bit sweet, but still so good and a bit more on the fudgey side of cakes.Overall, I liked this place and would come back again!\", \"Personally, due to the recent crime hike in San Francisco, especially near Japan Town, I try to steer away from the city.  However, the uniqueness and creativity at this restaurant incentivized me to actually drive into the city to try it out.  This restaurant definitely did not disappoint. Here is a list of what we ordered: Complimentary Side Dishes - excellent and a great spin on traditional Korean side dishes.  The tomato kimchi was my favorite; very unique and full of flavor. The pickled cucumber was delicious as well. Kimchi Oyster - The oysters were fresh and the pickled vegetables complimented the oysters and brought it to the next level. Steamed Egg & Caviar - this was definitely not something I was expecting.  The steamed eggs were smooth and silky.  The potato crunch added gave the steamed egg an unexpected crunch.  The caviar made the egg really hearty.  Really different from traditional Korean steamed egg, but highly recommend. Brussels Sprouts - this dish was wow, one of the best Brussels sprouts I've ever had. Brussels sprouts were cooked to perfection.  The brussels sprouts were topped with ricotta cheese and kimchi aioli, and it was out of this world.  This is a must order! Gamja Jorim - We had to order this because some Yelpers recommended this.  We think the soy glazed potatoes were good, especially with their smoked crème fraiche and bacon bits, but it was way too salty.  This was the only dish we couldn't finish. Like Soy Fried Chicken - the fried chicken was juicy and flavorful.  Lime soy sauce were a good addition to the nicely fried chicken. The shishito pepper that it came with were also very flavorful and soaked in the lime soy sauce.  The ormija radish pickles could have been pickled a little longer. Mulhwe Noodle - the cold noodle were very refreshing, can definitely eat this on a hot summer day.  The fermented chili broth taste surreal, because it doesn't look like how it taste.  The noodle had a great texture, and the fish was very fresh.  Soy Milk Canelé - delicious and perfect combination of tart and sweetness. Canelé goes well with their Korean mandarin anglaise and citrus confit.  The servers were friendly and thoroughly explained each dish as they bring you your order.  I personally really liked the decor, the ambiance is perfect for date night.  To be honest, I thought those hanging flowers by the kitchen were roasted duck at a quick glance.  Overall, I would highly recommend Bansang; if you can overlook the location of this restaurant.\", \"Summary:Fusion that falls shortDetails:Bansang is another one of those spots that's been on my list for a while, and with the recent Bib Gourmand award, I figured I should come try it before things got too hard to book. Unfortunately, like many other fusion places, Bansang fell short of our expectations, which is a bummer given how much we like their other spot, Daeho.Without getting into too many details, the only dishes we really ended up liking were the little banchan appetizers they offered up at the beginning, the jang cream pasta towards the end, and the caneles for dessert. Everything else had admittedly interesting flavors, but were just too heavily seasoned: some of the savory dishes a bit too sweet, but mostly, too salty, like the hwe ssam and gamja jorim, both of which would have been pretty good if they had halved the sodium.Accessibility:Huge restaurant with plenty of accessible seating options, both at tables and the kitchen bar (which is a bit higher, but not nearly bar counter height).\", 'Bansang has just been added to the Michelin Guide\\'s list of Bib Gourmand restaurants, and this trendy restaurant serves a menu of small plates influenced by the flavors of Korean cuisine. Like at any good Korean restaurant, the meal started with complimentary banchan dishes--one made of sliced cucumber in a green sauce and another of \"kimchi\" green tomatoes. The banchans were highlight dishes in and of themselves, and we asked for more and more refills!From the Tapas section of the menu, the Korean Steak Tartare was a refreshing, umami mixture of raw chopped striploin beef mixed with Korean pear, topped with Parmesan, and served with warm blue corn tortilla chips on the side. The Sunchoke and Truffle was an umami bomb made of sunchoke cooked 3 ways, paired with 3 varieties of mushrooms, all topped with shavings of winter truffle--definitely a must-get for truffle lovers! The Rice Cakes & Chorizo came with crispy rice cake batons topped with tiny slices of chorizo, roasted gochujang, and cotija cheese; and the Lime Soy Fried Chicken were classic \"Korean fried chicken\" wings in a sticky sweet and savory sauce, served with radish pickle and shishito peppers. From the Large Tapas menu, the Mulhwe Noodle was a take on a cold noodle soup made with a spicy chili broth, raw slices of red snapper, noodles, herbs, and pickled vegetables; the Gochujang Black Cod was a silky fillet of cod served with a creamy gochujang marinade and bean sprouts; the Jang Cream Pasta was made of al dente rigatoni in a mushroom cream sauce with maitake and sugar snap peas; and the Radish Kimchi Fried Rice was made with pork belly, kimchi, Parmesan, and a poached egg in the middle. Some of the standout dishes included the banchan, the Steak Tartare, the Sunchoke and Truffle, and the Lime Soy Fried Chicken, but every dish we had was creative, beautifully-plated, and distinct in flavor. While many of the dishes made use of Korean ingredients and cooking techniques, the flavor profiles were subtler than what you\\'d find in traditional Korean cuisine but delicious nonetheless!', \"Overall, had a great experience. Everything was delicious. Some favorites: Sunchoke and Truffle and Jang Cream Pasta. Mulhwe Noodle was very tasty; never had anything like it. The Galbi Ribeye was a can skip for our group. It wasn't bad or anything but just didn't stand out. Brussel sprouts were too heavily seasoned for my group, but I enjoyed it overall. Wish the Tartare came with something else to eat with such as lotus root chips or seaweed tempura rather than blue tortilla chips. The scallop in the Uni Scallop Toast was too thinly sliced where it didn't add to the toast and the bread itself was so thick where it overwhelmed everything else.Service was great though. Really liked the space and decor with the high ceilings.\", \"I've been wanting to try Bansang for awhile now and it didn't disappoint. I came with a friend and we got 4 dishes between the 2 of us and we were stuffed. We got the fried chicken, kimchi fried rice, galbi New York strip, and the uni toast. My favorite was the fried chicken! It was zesty, juicy, crispy and packed full of flavor. We got add on vegetables for the beef but wish it came with more considering it was $5.. I could get a whole head of lettuce for $5 lol.This is served tapas style so the portions are smaller than your average korean restaurants. But overall I would come back with a bigger group to try more of their menu.\", 'My friends treated me to dinner for my birthday here and it was a great time. There was five of us so we knew we were going to order a good number of dishes to share. We almost ordered the whole menu!We started with some cocktails and quickly started in on the small plates. The squashini pancake was extra delicious, as was the chorizo and rice cakes. I loved thr gochujang black cod and galbi NY strip, but the Jang cream pasta was the real standout. Perfectly cooked rigatoni with an umami mushroom cream, maitake mushrooms and sugar snap peas - I almost wanted to order another just for myself. The staff were lovely, even putting birthday greetings on my menu and bringing a special soy milk canale with a candle to celebrate. Even the décor was sleek and cool, with a side room having a light fixture that looks like a giant matcha whisk. I look forward to coming back to try even more of their menu.', \"Came here on a Sunday to celebrate a friends birthday (which they added a happy birthday to the menu of!) and really enjoyed my experience.The food was incredible. We got:- squashini pancake - uni scallop toast - banchan side dishes: the cucumbers were dressed so well, honestly stood out to me - steamed egg & caviar- galbi strip steak and assorted lettuce wraps- gochujang black cod- rice cakes & chorizo: the rice cakes were crispy on the outside but so chewy on the inside.The ones that surprised me the most in a good way were the gochujang black cod and the rice cakes. I also enjoyed the uni scallop toast and galbi strip steak. If there's one thing I wouldn't get it again,  would be the steamed eggs and caviar.The ambiance is also very nice of course. It's a beautiful space. Service was good too.\", \"Four of us dined here for dinner on a Friday night and ordered 10 items and shared a bottle of wine. Since we are a bunch of meat and seafood eaters and this place is known for its meat and seafood, we thought it was surprising that the stand out was the vegetarian Jang cream pasta. Detailed reviews for each dish below:1) kimchi oysters (3/5)$4 per oyster - so I was expecting it to be out of this world but They were just okay. I thought the tomales bay oysters were fresh and the kimchi juice was not overbearing on the delicate taste of the oyster itself. However not worth $4. 2) steamed egg and caviar (3/5)This dish is SUPER small, sharing amount 4 ppl, we basically each had 1 spoonful. The egg had a custardy texture and the caviar was sparse. It was not bad but nothing to write home abt. 3) Korean beef tartar (3/5)The beef was fresh and flavors were good. The cheese didn't add much to this one, but it added interactive element of having to stir it before eating. 4) sunchoke and truffles (3.5/5)This was quite delicious but not because of the truffle. The sunchoke mushrooms had an earthy taste and the different textures of the dish made it fun to eat - crispy, soft, saucy. The sauce was creamy, savory and a little sweet. I really enjoyed this dish EXCEPT that the shaved truffles added nothing, it had zero flavor and if anything took away from the dish. 5) tuna toast (4/5)Another favorite of the evening. 2 pieces to share among 4 gave everyone a perfect bite. Skipjack tuna,  pickled beet, daikon ponzu, and shush Mayo on top of a what tasted like sour dough toast. The amalgamation of flavors was delicious and unexpected bc the presentation itself wasn't the prettiest (the tuna looked brownish rather than red). The shiso Mayo had a unique flavor - almost pesto like, but more earthy. 6) uni scallop toast (3/5)I had really high expectations for this one but alas it was just so so. Obviously when you put uni, scallop, trout roe together it's going to be good. But unless you've never had uni toast before this was nothing special. The bread was really plain and the black seaweed purée added no flavor. The tuna toast was infinitely more flavorful and unique. Also the price at a whopping $27 was hard to swallow 7) Mulhwe noodles (3/5)Raw hamachi, capellini, fermented chili broth, cucumber, pickles. This has a unique presentation, the server brought it over in a bowl wjth all dry ingredients and then poured the chili broth over it. She told us not to stir it but that we should eat all the ingredients together. The dish was served cold, the fish was fresh and noodles were cooked well, slight kick but not spicy. The sauce was savory with a chili taste and a little sweetness. 8) jang cream pasta (4.5/5)Never thought I'd enjoy a vegetarian pasta dish so much. The rigatoni was perfectly Al dente and cream sauce covered every ridge of the pasta evenly. The maitake and sugar snap peas were also coated perfectly with the sauce. The amalgamation of textures really came together with the creaminess of the sauce, earthiness of the mushroom and freshness of the peas. We almost didn't order this one but glad we did. 9) galbi ribeye (3/5)This came with 10oz of ribeye steak with lettuce wraps and various banchans. The meat came as a medium rare and cooked perfectly. The lettuce basket came with Romain, butter lettuce and shiso leaves. I personally love using shiso wrap so I enjoyed that detail. The dish itself was delicious and met expectations. The points off was due to the fish being a whopping $52 10) gochujang black cod (2.5/5)In hindsight prob would not Have ordered this one. The redness came from the gochujang marinade that was a little sweet and had a little kick, but didn't have a lot of flavor. The cod itself was delicate and absorbed the sauce. But the dish overall didn't have a lot of flavor. They should bring this on before serving the galbi as it's hard to follow something with so much flavor. Overall my experience at Bansang was a 3.5/5, the food was delicious, presented nicely, the service was not bad, the ambiance was comfortable and modern. For four ppl it came out to be ~120 per person. Would I come back here? Probably not high on my list, but nonetheless I'm glad I came here and tried out the dishes.\", \"I've been seeing this place all over social media but was so very disappointed :( I made a reservation online for a Friday night but there were plenty of tables so we would've been fine without. When we checked in, it was really awkward because the host was taking forever to figure out where to seat us and had to pull over a coworker and the manager(I think) ended up seating us after uncomfortably standing there for a few minutes. They provided 2 banchans- cucumber and tomatoes. The cucumber one was very average and I've had many cucumber salads like this. The tomatoes were pretty interesting! Slightly pickled and had a good crunch to it.We ordered an uni scallop toast and Jang cream pasta. The uni scallop toast is extremely overpriced at $27 for a 2-biter toast. Aesthetically it's beautiful but the taste is not good at all. The toast came room temp which is unsettling considering the toppings are raw. There was too much going on and the parts didn't compliment each other. The toast was too hard and you can't distinguish the seafood on top, it just tastes very fishy. I feel like this dish has potential if the toast was toasted properly and the seafood wasn't as overbearing. The Jang cream pasta tasted like some canned cream of mushroom sauce with peas. Overly salty and got tired of it after a few bites. We were disappointed this place is supposed to be Korean fusion but none of the dishes we ordered had any Korean influences? We started to see bad reviews while we were deciding what to order and that's why we ordered so little but we were so glad we only ordered 2 items. Our bill was still $65 with tax and tip which is crazy for the amount of food we got. Definitely wouldn't recommend and would have rather spent my money elsewhere..\", 'I loved the food here & the vibes inside! Service was 10/10 - highly recommend the rice cakes, BOTH cocktails (G&T and Lemon Drop), miso pork, and brussel sprouts- Tuna toast was simply one piece for $14 so honestly not sure if its worth it- I would also skip the pasta - it was just okay Overall though, pretty innovative flavors & loved the modern twist on some of the more traditional Korean dishes', \"I appreciate the concept behind Bansang and the atmosphere and service definitely lends itself to the higher price point that high end fusion cuisine demands. We were promptly seated for our reservation and our server was knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. That being said, while I think most of our dishes at Bansang were good, the fusion aspect of the restaurant was a miss for us. The salad was delicious and fresh, but comparable to many other good restaurants I've been to. The fried chicken and potatoes I felt similarly about - very well done, but markedly lacking in fusion. The cod in particular was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth, but bland, with a slight zing from the gochujang glaze, but not enough to be aromatic. For me, it's clear the chefs here are top notch at technique, but I think there's some more experimenting to be done with the flavor profiles. In the meantime, SF has a lot of other great fusion places I'd prefer to visit instead.\", 'Was skeptical about the concept... Korean tapas? Decided to try it based on all the favorable reviews. Some of the dishes were truly tiny, like the uni scallop toast (not my favorite dish, and pretty pricey), but the rest were decent & actually shareable. Flavors were good. Nothing really stood out as mind-blowing. OK as a one-hitter-quitter. Not planning a return trip. I do have to mention, service was on point, so we made sure to tip well.', \"I love restaurants that encourage sharing! We ordered a bit too much food for two people but were happy to try more items. It's hard to choose a favorite dish since they were all so good. The miso pork, rice cakes, and chocolate cake were uniquely marvelous. You could really taste the lime in the lime soy fried chicken which was a pleasant surprise. The cocktails were also tasty! Our server was very kind and attentive throughout the meal.\", \"I came here with my co-workers for dinner. It was on a Thursday but we did have to make reservations. This new restaurant has a modern and romantic ambiance. There are even rows of dried hung flowers across the staff's kitchen which was a cute touch.We were a group of 4 and decided to try out 6 dishes along with drinks and desserts. We ordered the Korean steak tartare, lime soy fried chicken & charred broccolini from the tapas menu. As for mains, we got the mulhwe noodles, kimchi fried rice, and miso-marinated pork, and all shared it the family style.The food was quickly prepared and came out nicely presented, definitely on par with the upscale fusion competitors. The food tasted great but the portions are on the smaller side. I do like that they provided 2 banchan varieties for our table though! There are definitely a few standouts that I would come back for:Mulhwee noodles: The server came out with the dish and pour on the orange fermented broth right at our table, which definitely calls for a social media moment! I was surprised at how refreshing & tangy the dish was. It is a cold noodle so everything tasted very fresh, pairing well with the sliced sashimi.Lime soy fried chicken: This is probably my favorite dish! I love a good Korean fried chicken. It was crispy, pipping hot, and pack a tangy punch.Miso marinated pork: The pork was SOOOOO tender and juicy. The miso is not in your face but definitely gives it that savory unami profile. The service was great! Everyone we've encountered has been super friendly. It was my co-worker's birthday so they even gave her a menu with cute birthday stamps all over it. For dessert, we opted to share the chocolate cake! To our surprise, the server also brought along the Soy milk canele on the house. Overall, with the higher price tag, this definitely won't be a place I'll get to visit often but it's definitely on the back of my mind if I ever need a dinner spot for special occasions!\", \"Came here to celebrate my best friends birthday and had the best time. If you are in a large group I'd recommend ordering at least 2 of each tapa and then 1 of each large tapa:Stonefruit salad 9/10such a refreshing dish to start off our mealuni scallop toast 10/10Usually uni can be overwhelmingly ocean-y however this dish was perfectly balancedGamja Jorim 9/10Absolute umami bomb!!Korean Steak Tartare 8/10Like the stonefruit salad it's a very refreshing dish. Also easy to share.Radish Kimchi Fried Rice & Jang Cream Pasta 10/10:LOVEEE the crispy bits in the fried rice and how the egg yolk is the ~perfect~ texture. The pasta was my personal favorite. I was surprised at how the mushrooms in this dish sorta tasted like meat?? Also like how the pasta wasn't too saucy :)Sorbet float 8/10I am not a sorbet person at all but I was pleasantly surprised at how the sorbet was not watery at all.Chocolate cake 10/10This is one of the best chocolate cakes I've ever had in my life. The chocolate wasn't so dark and the cake itself was very light and fluffy. I also love the blackberry caramel sauce inside and the pistachios on topSoy Milk Canele 10/10If you had to choose one of the desserts on the menu I'd say get the canele! Super crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Such an amazing texture. The flavor itself is not too sweet and the citrus confit added a nice hint of tanginess.\", 'Yum! Great place to share tapas with friends. Good variety, nice ambiance for sit down meal and everything was delicious.', 'Service is very friendly. Nice dinner spot for a date.

Barberio Osterio stands out for their upscale Italian fare that respects the classics while adding a modern and regional twist. The service was welcoming and attentive. Pre dinner Alpine spritz was refreshing while we drooling over how good all the items on the menu sounded. Being pescatarians made the choice a lot simpler. Tonno e Fagioli, so fresh  and flavorful. Complimentary bread w. olive  dipping oil was appreciated. The Caramelle, a playful take on a tootsie roll style pasta , twisted shut at the ends-  with pureed red beet inside, really great , I could have eaten more of that . The snapper  for two perfectly cooked and seved w some really tasty condiments, calabrian chilis, a green herb sauce, and olive kind of tapenade all greatly enhancing the fish. We had some very  good Mt  Etna wines. and to top it off the manager comped us a velvety Cookies and Creme scoop of gelato for my birthday. The interior is deep , with table and chefs bar seating.

The area is tough for autos tho , park in the garage down the  Wells Fargo alley -$ 4 / hr.\", \"A couple of weeks ago while walking on Valencia...past the old @Locanda space...we noticed a new restaurant had moved in. The interior space looked nicely designed. The posted menu looked great. We made a mental note to return. Friday night we had a table near the front window and settled in. The place is very attractive. We were warmly greeted and we started by ordering a bottle of 2018 Bramaterra, Colombera & Garella, Piemonte Nebbiolo. The wine steward was very helpful and knew the wine list well. There was plenty to like on the menu. We started with a Stuzzichini - 'Nduja (house cured Stemple Creek Ranch pork spicy, smoky, spreadable calabrian salumi, pickled red onion, calabrian chili, pickled Lonely Mountain Farm's peppers, grilled Acme levain). Terrific. Good potion. We also ordered Giardiniera di Agrodolce \\u200b(traditional northern italian style sweet & sour pickled vegetables). Again very good though we'd have preferred fewer cucumbers and more cauliflower and carrots. Nonetheless very goodNext up from the Antipasti  menu we ordered Prosciutto di San Daniele (gnocco fritto, K&J marinated pears, mint, olio extra vergine di oliva, 3 year aceto balsamico di modena). Again, really good plate. Finally from the Primi menu we ordered two pasta dishes. Pappardelle \\u200b-(10 hour bolognese-Rossotti Ranch veal, Schmitz Ranch dry aged beef, Stemple Creek pork, prosciutto di san daniele, soffritto, baby spinach, parmigiano-reggiano). And the Tagliatelle di Spinaci (Stemple Creek Ranch braised pork belly ragu, fennel, porcini mushrooms, braised greens, sage, thyme, lemon, pork jus, porcini crema, parmigiano-reggiano). Both excellent. All the food was great. Service excellent. Good wine list. Great ambiance (good lighting and we could easily converse without screaming). Highly recommended. We will definitely be back since there are so many other items on the menu. We really wanted to try. And maybe next time we will try to save some space for dessert.\", \"I don't write many reviews, but Barberio was fantastic and deserves some love. We sat at the chefs counter for an early dinner for a show. The drinks and appetizers were wonderful.  The pappardelle was fantastic. Wide cut, just right texture, and a killer savory bolognese. The staff brought an extra scoop of gelato for my wife's birthday to cap off a wonderful visit. Will definitely be back again.\", 'Highly recommend! All of the dishes were really good and surprisingly well priced (for SF, of course). In order of preference: 1. Pappardelle was simply phenomenal. A classic.2. mackerel was amazing -- and it came with a bunch of sides that were all really good. 3. The Insalatina salad portion was good too.4. Had a squash filled pasta and despite it looking small it was tasty and still relatively filling.Overall, great date spot and beautiful place. The space feels elevated but in a subtle way; the service was good and felt very taken care of.', \"The brilliant team from the beloved AltoVino restaurant on Nob Hill have expanded their magic to the Mission! We tried many plates from the menu & the kitchen executed them all with flair & precision. Fresh and seasonal Italian food (with a modern twist), whole wood grilled seafood, handmade pasta, dishes created from locally sourced ingredients paired with an expansive wine list is the concept & it works. We tried most of the appetizers but the Smokey N'duja pate with pickled onions, assorted peppers & grilled bread was my favorite.The whole grilled mackerel accompanied by a crisp, zingy, herb & fennel salad, buttery castelvetrano olives & a bright, herbaceous olive oil rich salsa verde was the star of the night!The braised lamb filled sachetti were tender pasta parcels served with a light zucchini fondue...I loved the velvety rich textures & bright individual flavors that brought together this earthy but elegant dish.The salt cod & potato filled pasta with fresh clams were my favorite. This plate was stunning in its beauty & relied on all natural components that made  this dish pop!Desserts are simple & light, all made in house. There are so many new plates to try & the staff will welcome you so warmly, you will never want to leave this pristine, professional & lively new space that is much needed in the community.\", '4.5 STARSAs we were savoring the food at Barberio Osterio, waves of pleasure rolled through my body while I tried to hold in my creepy, euphoric Mark Wiens face.And, then one lady\\'s raucous laughing shook the dining room and cut that \\'gasm real short. Whomp whomp. As with any new hip resto, Barberio Osterio is very lively so it may be it\\'s best to dine right they open on a weeknight or during lunch to have a more enjoyable experience. We had 5:30 pm rezzies on a Friday, and by 6:30 pm...the noise level was too much and we couldn\\'t hold a convo.Opening mid-September, Barberio Osterio is already the \"IT\" spot on Valencia. And, for good reason because the food is remarkable. So, def make those rezzies on Resy esp on the weekends. They\\'re open for indoor dining only.M E N URegional Italian Cuisine using seasonal, locally sourced ingredients. Pastas are homemade.

There just wasn\\'t enough bolognese to coat the long, wide sheets of papparadelle so it tasted on the plain, drier side. * Pesce al Sale: Black cod roasted under salt & herb crust, roasted summer squash, frittella di zucchine, cherry tomatoes, capers, castelvetrano olives, young onion, soft herbs, cherry tomato passato ($39): https://tinyurl.com/yvumnudbCarved and plated tableside: https://tinyurl.com/yjr4rcsc, the pesce al sale is NOT to be missed. If you know me, I prefer raw fish and I loathe olives...yet I found myself going back for more...and more. The black cod was silky, moist, and effortlessly flaked off with the brush of our forks. The accompaniments added freshness and texture...those crispy zucchini fritter tho...so good. The bursts of salty umami from the ikura completed this dish. GET THIS TOO!* Zabaglionep: Nectarine zabaglione, citrus granita, macerated berries & stone fruit ($12): https://tinyurl.com/p6mutzk9To end this awesome dinner, we wanted something light and healthy...and the zabalionep delivered.

Everyone from the manager, server, food runner, and bussers were so kind. Food service was prompt and courses were well-paced. A M B I A N C ERustic modern charm with an open kitchen. Good for solo dining at the bar or date night. P A R K I N GVery challenging street parking (avoid driving through Valencia). There\\'s a parking garage in back, at Hoff and 16th (Wells Fargo alley). Overall, in a city that excels in both old and new skool Italian food, Barberio Osterio stands out for their upscale Italian fare that pays homage to the classics while adding a modern flair. Mmmm, still thinking about the sacchetti and pesce al sale. Def a great addition to The Mission\\'s food scene!', \"Stumbled upon this new restaurant bc we were craving Italian food. Overall would recommend and would come back! Upscale modern chic type of ambiance. Could tell they recently opened because service could be improved upon, but nothing was bad at all. Everyone was very nice and welcoming but more knowledge about the dishes may have been more helpful for us. The food was solid. Ascolani - fried olives with oxtail. Very salty bc of the salted olives but a nice palette opener Pomodoro - refreshing heirloom tomatoes with cucumbers and the most fresh buffalo mozzarellaSacchetti -\\u200b pasta parcels filled with slow roasted Anderson lamb shoulder was SO GOOD. Highly recommend this. Malloreddus - saffron semola pasta with spicy pork fennel sausage, pasta cooked perfectly el dente. I'm a huge fan of fennel sausage so this was also a win Panna cotta - average\", \"Fantastic neighborhood spot. The staff are super friendly and knowledgeable, the food was amazing. Love the open kitchen, feels so intimate. We sat at the bar and had friendly banter with a very knowledgeable bartender. I hope they get a liquor license soon (although the wine list is robust). Great experience, don't kid yourself, get the bolognese or whole fish cooked in salt. Everything is good but those are m faves. They change their menu often to include fresh seasonal items. What more could you ask for?\", 'I mostly came here because I wanted the cod baked in salt but they had sold out :( Regardless the rest of the meal was very delicious. We had one of the salads and mussels to start and then shared three pastas (the lamb dumplings, the squab tagliatelle, and the sausage pasta. All super yummy. For dessert had the espresso panna cotta which was super yummy. Hope to come back for the main event some time', \"Great dinner! Staff was very friendly and accommodating! Waters and wine glasses were constantly full. Locally sourced ingredients and full portions. 'nduja appetizer was a great recommendation by our server, served on local Acme bread. Hearty and flavorful pastas. Coffee pana cotta was a light but slightly sweet perfect ending to a large meal. Perfect date night evening.\", 'The pasta here is delicious and the staff is very friendly. This restaurant is beautiful and a great place to gather with family and friends!', \"I was lucky enough to dine at Barberio Osteria during their soft opening. The food was absolutely on point and the well-curated wine list offered fun and interesting options to pair with the meal. With the many tempting pasta dishes on the menu it was hard to choose. Our server suggested the the Pappardelle and I'm so glad he did! It was a generous portion, came out piping hot and what I didn't finish, my dining partner was more than happy to! We also had the Tagiatelle di Ortica which was equally delicious. Can't wait to return, there's so many things I want to try on the menu - the whole fish, La Fiorentina steak and the Bagna Caoda looked very tempting!\", \"Enjoyed the sacchetti (tender beggar's purses filled with lamb) sitting in a creamy zucchini fonduta.  Black cod baked in a salt herb crust was moist and flavorful.  Finished with a nice Zabaglione dessert.  Very good service.\", \"Really wanted to like this place, but was let down. The service was rude (don't usually say that), the food was just ok and the lack of vegetarian options brought this place down. The competition is fierce for a good Italian place around here...and this didn't measure up.\", 'Food are unbelievably good. Perfect service. Perfect place for a group friends ,family , Birthday dinner party .', \"There are many dinning options in the mission but until recently, the best ones were foreign cinema, Flour and Water or Penny Roma. As of a couple weeks ago Barberio Osteria should be on your list to. This place is great and i can't wait to go back. We went there because we are huge fans of Alto Vino (their sister restaurant) and we were not disappointed. Everything that a neighborhood restaurant should be. Great food at a reasonable price, amazing wine selection and spritz and above all a very welcoming and knowledgeable staff. To be this good with in a couple of weeks of opening tells me this restaurant will undoubtedly be a staple in the San Francisco dinning scene. Bravo!!!\", \"Place is great.  Awesome savory but not heavy food.  Everything tasted clean.  Inventive but approachable preparations.  I'm not usually a fish person but the salt cod was fantastic.  Great service and ambiance.  Chef Nick and his wife Calli are lovely.  One of the best wine by the glass set-ups I have seen.\", 'Nestled in the heart of the Mission District, Barberio is a true gem that promises an extraordinary dining experience. From the moment you step through the door, you feel the incredible energy. Service is top notch, staff is very knowledgable and friendly. Food was unforgettable in the best way possible! Excited for this great addition to the neighborhood!']\n",

      "Reviews: [\"Food and drinks are absolutely amazing. Service is lacking. Last time I went, after driving two hours and waiting 30 for a drink. The new server finally took our appetizer order. That was the only time we saw him all night. As the kitchen closed he asked if we were ready for the bill. That was the worst service we've ever had. But the food is great!!!!\", \"This will be a regular dining venue.  Our party had 4 different pastas. Saffron risotto ossobuco , risotto frutti  di Mara. We're excellent.  I had the rotolo which was really unique, a rolled pasta with braised rabbit bechamel and fontina just amazing. Cocktails: golden thread was similar to a  old fashion but lighter., Martinis really nice.  Gelato: Sicilian pistachio and pomegranate sorbettto had great texture and had vibrant flavornice to end the meal with.  Oh the homemade foccacia was really special, a different take than normal.  Can't wait to come back.\", \"Went here for brunch the other day and overall had a decent time! The service was nice and the venue is cute and centrally located.The polenta braise was really yummy and felt like it was good bang for your buck. It was creamy and savory, but I felt like I needed one more piece of focaccia to really soak it up.The burrata was a real rip off though. For $17, we expected to get like a whole chunk of burrata with bread and persimmon/candied walnuts on it. However, we literally got one piece of toast with a small smear of burrata. This didn't feel worth the price point at all. I did feel a bit mislead because I asked about portion sizes and was led to believe the burrata would be filling for 2 people which was just not true.Ultimately, I'd go back and try to order a different appetizer or I'd try dinner.\", \"Tldr; cold and salty food combined with subpar service. Ideally, I'd give this place a 2.5, but I can't justify rounding up.  The Tailor's Son provides both indoor and outdoor dining experiences. The restaurant's ambiance is undeniably chic, with stylish décor and a lively atmosphere. Unfortunately, when you make a reservation, you can't provide your seating preference. I made a reservation weeks ahead of time, only to be informed by the restaurant on the day of our reservation that they'll be seating us outside (in late November). Their outdoor space is covered and has heaters on the ceiling, but it's not as effective. We were fine, but I wish they had provided more info about our dinner reservation earlier. There were 3 of us, so we tried a few items from their menu. There were 2 things that were consistent about every dish that we tried - they were all (including the desserts) too salty and were served lukewarm or cold.We ordered- **Appetizers**1. House foccasia2. Carne cruda3. Mondeghili4. Prosciutto di parma**Mains**1. Agnolotti del pin2. Rotolo**Desserts**1. Budino2. Apple crostataThe bread in the foccasia and the crostini was dry. Meatballs in mondeghili were light but salty. The gnocco frittos in prosciutto di parma were a bit doughy. The sauce for the agnolotti del pin was very watery, so it wouldn't stick to the pasta. Again, it was too salty as well. And the pasta was undercooked. Apple crostata was okay. Both the whipped cream and the ice cream were salty. The ice cream was also very rich and dense. The service was all over the place. Our server did a great job explaining the menu and walking us through the popular dishes, but after that, we struggled to get the attention of the staff whether it was for getting water refilled, or asking for a menu/check. They were just slamming dishes on our table and leaving so fast that we couldn't even get a word out to get their attention. I wonder if that's because we were seated outside and there was a lot going on inside.Anyway, we gave this place a try and most likely won't be back.\", 'Came in with a reservation for a party of 3 on a Friday at 5:15pm, and were seated immediately.The interior is super cute! I love the peaceful green color all along the walls and tables. Gives off a very welcoming yet clean and chic feel.Here is everything we ordered:Crudo Di Tonno - the fish tasted a bit stale for us, gives kind of a very \"fishy\" flavor in the not-so-fresh way. I liked the grapefruit, I thought it added a nice bright acidity. Also, this dish is spicy! I\\'m not sure how the table felt about it, it\\'s an interesting touch.Toscana - my personal favorite shareable crostini for the table. You don\\'t get too much, but I liked what I got. The sweetness from the marmellata goes with the umami from the paté very well. Yum!Baccala Mantecato - salted cod, a good tummy filler.Spaghettini Nero - good, as expected. The shrimp pieces are well-seasoned, and the pasta is al-dente.Agnolotti del Plin - another good tummy filler, I think of these like veal and pork dumplings with cheese and some sauce. I liked it!With drinks and a good group of friends I think you\\'d have a fun time at The Tailor\\'s Son! The ambience is lively and welcoming, and my group had a really good time. The food was some-good and some-misses, but nothing detracted from the enjoyment of our night. I\\'d say give them a shot if you\\'re in the area and are craving some Italian!', \"This restaurant has been on my list for a while and I'm glad to finally try it. The interior was very cute and great for date night, girls night, or a small group dinner. They also had plenty of outdoor seating.We had a reservation for a weekend dinner and got seated immediately when arrived. The two of us ordered two appetizers and two pastas to share. There were some unique flavour combos such as the persimmon and burrata, and duck leg pasta and everything was executed perfectly. It was a good amount of food for two girls and we enjoyed people watching while eating.They have a pretty long wine list but I wanted to try a cocktail so I ordered the one with matcha foam (can't remember the name). It wasn't spirit-forward but delicious nevertheless.\", \"Busy restaurant! Rezzies highly encouraged. They have a good happy hour too until 7pm weekdays but at the bar only. Lots of Italian influenced options. Octopus was fresh and so was burrata. Enjoyed the squid ink pasta too.Nice indoor space with open concept kitchen. Can't complain about the service, polished and professional. Hard to park as it's on a very busy street.\", \"Wonderful! Food was great. Lovely menu. Service was kinda weird. Hostess came on strong and then our waiter never checked back in between us ordering our food and getting the back. I enjoyed the setup of the restaurant as well as the overall ambiance. I'll likely be back for the food!\", \"Brunch at The Tailor's Son was a real treat. Whenever we are visiting SF our son manages to take us to  some really good restaurants. He does not believe in taking us to the same place twice (exception being breweries and bars).Daniel opted for the Italian 75 while I enjoyed my Chef's Breakfast - not your normal Bloody Mary. We both ordered the Polenta Braise (Pork Ragu, Poached Eggs, Polenta and Foccaccia) with the Pomodoro (Baked Eggs, San Marzano Tomatoes, Pancetta and Crostini). Everything was terrific and the place was quite busy. Try it - you will like it!\", \"I love tailors son on Fillmore! We came on a Thursday for Theo happy hour and were pleasantly surprised! Their pizzas are different and unique- they remind me of a thin scallion pancake with toppings vs the traditional pizza with fluffy crust you might be used to. Regardless the ingredients for the toppings are top tier and delicious. We ordered the cannoleni pasta and saffron risotto with bone marrow on the regular menu and had no regrets! The saffron pasta was unique and creamy, and the cannoleni was warm and luscious. I'll definitely come back!\", \"I've been wanting to check out this restaurant for a while, such a good place for brunch and dinner. The interior is really pretty and laid back. We arrived at the restaurant at 4ish and they told us to wait in the bar until the tables available for dinner. Calamari: a perfect fried appetizer. It was crispy and the aioli was so good. Bucatini: Amazing! The tomato sauce is tangy, the pasta is cooked al dente and everything was just really well balanced. I'd love the guanchale to be a bit crispier but that's just a personal preference. Spaghettini: Interesting flavor. There's some spice to it and my friend enjoyed the dish a lot!  Overall we had a good time. Great food and great ambiance. I'd love the portion to be bigger, though.\", \"Really cute, modern, clean, and sleek interior. The ambience is chic with its high ceilings! The food blew us away. Something as simple as deviled eggs were sooooo packed with flavor & yummy. All of their pizzas were yummy, especially the mushroom one, which we got twice!Their cocktails are spirit forward, well balanced, and nice & strong. Tailor's son is our favorite, and we can't wait to bring some out of town visitors we have coming soon!\", \"Had a reservation for 2 for 7:30p on a Wednesday and were seated immediately. All the other tables were full and there was an air of energy everywhere. Definitely a great place for a date night or a fun night with friends.We had a hard time picking from the menu since everything looked delicious. We ended up going with:TOSCANA- 5/5 the duck liver was SO creamy like a lil bite of heaven. My picture doesn't do it justice.BUCATINI ALL'AMATRICIANA- 5/5 fresh pasta, delicious sauce. A classicAL GAMBERI RISOTTO- 4/5 didn't enjoy this one as much as the other two but still solid! Shrimp and risotto were nicely balancedESPRESSO MARTINIS- 4/5 smells delicious, goes down smoothly\", 'Humm.. I want to give this place a better review but I think given how competitive the SF dining scene is when it is also located at the heart of Filmore, Tailor\\'s son is at best \"average,\" which I\\'d argue a 3.5 star equivalent. We ordered a cocktail, of a name I can\\'t even remeber because it was so diluted with water/ice that I couldn\\'t tasted really any alcohol or flavor. I didn\\'t think it was any good.For starters, we had an anchovy little gem salad (4/5), Caprese (5/5), and the shrimp risotto/ Al Gamberi (3/5), and the Agnolotti Del Plin (3/5). The main issue of the food I believe is the seasoning, dressing, and the sauces. For the shrimp risotto, the rice was very well-done with lack of seasoning. The shrimp was alright but the rice had nothing to do in terms of pairing with the shrimp. The pasta, was a very contemporary version of the original Agnolotti Del Plin, which was like tiny Italian dumpling with filling of roasted meat (pork/veal). However, this restaurant made it in a new form in terms of the dough, but also failed on the creamy sauce that had the past sat in. It was lack of salt or literally any flavor to it. i\\'m not saying this place is bad, or to avoid completely.. I\\'m only saying you probably have better options if craving Italian food.', 'Cute outdoor seating in fillmore. Dog friendly. Pretty small menu and portions, but everything was generally tasty. Service was good, all the servers were nice.  Even gave the dogs water and some oyster crackers as a snack.  The little gem salad was refreshing, egg cooked perfectly. The duck pate was a little salty nevertheless tasty. We took a stroll to the Lyon Steps after brunch. Nice walk and fancy home viewing.', 'I\\'ve dined here twice so far and enjoyed everything I\\'ve eaten. My most recent experience was a \"treat yo self\" day.  I got a glass of rosé, the mushroom risotto, and the lemon olive oil cake. The mushroom risotto was so good!  It lives up to the hype imo.  The rice was cooked perfectly and it was full of mushroom flavor.  It was a good portion, too. I was full, but I needed to get a dessert to round out all that savory goodness.  Eating the lemon olive oil cake was love at first bite!  It was so delicious!  The cake was moist and full of lemon flavor. It also came with a scoop of lemon gelato, which added bit of tartness.  I\\'m more of a chocolate person, and they do have a chocolate dessert on the menu.  But I highly recommend the lemon olive oil cake, which will be my go-to dessert the next time I dine here. Service was friendly and I got my food pretty quickly.  The restaurant has a good space for both small and large parties.  The last time I was here, they had a parklet but I don\\'t know if it\\'s still there considering the city\\'s new rules.  Because it\\'s spacious inside, the acoustics aren\\'t that great.  It can get really noisy.  I want to come back here for happy hour. It gets really busy around that time. If you want a table, definitely make a reservation. If you\\'re there for happy hour, the bar seating is first come first serve.', \"I wanted to try tailors son..his parents were tailors  in Italy..he became a chef..I got there on a Friday during happy hour..wanted to try so called pizza and calamari..I tried to the happy hour pizza with funghi and I didn't like it..it had a strange white sauce and some mushrooms with crispy bread ..I didn't eat most of it..calamari whatever.. overpriced and not sure about this kind of Italian food..fun tailor outfits ..if u like drinking ...on Fillmore Pacific heights\", 'Great spot! Yummy drinks and great flavors for their brunch. Personally, felt like their portions were too rather small compared to other brunch spots but if you want a light plate to not feel too full, this is is it.Charming indoor decor and great outdoor patio!', \"Date of Visit: 5/13/2023There are many decent Italian restaurants opening up in San Francisco recently. We visited The Tailor's Son located on Fillmore Street on Mother's Day weekend. They just opened for about 2 years by Adriano Paganini, who was born and raised in Milan. Adriano Paganini's mother was an exceptional cook, and many of the dishes on our menu were inspired by meals she prepared for her family.We made a reservation beforehand for Saturday noon, and it was about 80% full in the restaurant when we arrived. I think walk-ins will be fine at the time.There are some light cocktails and brunch selection during the weekend lunch hours. Bramble Berry Spritz $13I got the berry cocktail with vermouth and prosecco based, with house blackberry shrub, lemon and seltzer mixed. Highway of the Sun $14I also like Highway of the Sun, which is an aperol, gin and carpano bianco based. And there was a slice of orange on top of the ice cubes. Sprezzatura $14My friend got the Sprezzatura, which is a vodka based cocktail, with peach, pineapple, lemon, mint, and sparkling moscato. The taste was fairly light. Espresso Martini $14Espresso martini is more on the sweeter side. House Focaccia $5We got the house made focaccia as a starter. With rosemary, sea salt and olive oil on top. Uova Alla San Benedettina $18This is similar to egg benedict. With prosciutto cotto, poached eggs, parmesan crème on top of the focaccia. Spaghetti Carbonara $18We got two orders of spaghetti carbonara. The spaghetti was chewy with egg yolk and pancetta, which is a good brunch selection. Panini $16One of our friends got the panini, and inside are mortadella, prosciutto cotto, and salame.Bomboloni $9Highly recommend the bomboloni! With strawberry jam on the side. it was not too sweet but tasty! Definitely a good add on or dessert during the brunch hours. Side Fruit $5We ordered side fruit to pair with our brunch. It has strawberry, blood orange, orange, kiwi, and blueberry Gelato $7The Fior di Latte gelato was a little too sweet on a warm afternoon.\", \"I've been here twice (on week nights) and both times have been a great experience. They seem to be pretty busy so I recommend a reservation. The restaurant decor gives me whimsical minimal yet industrial diner vibes. Food was delicious (somewhat small portions) with great cocktails. Service: 4/5Food and drink: 5/5Atmosphere: 5/5Overall: 4.5/5\", 'I arrived for dinner hungry and was not disappointed. I showed up around 8:45 on a Saturday night and it was still very lively.The star of the night was the Al Gamberi, which was creamy and savory. I also liked the other plates we ordered - the Agnolotti Del Plin was beefy and cheesy, and the Toscana crostini was sweet and savory with the pâté and compote (although I wish the pâté had a stronger flavor). Our server was attentive and prompt. However, I think there was a bit of confusion towards the end because we had our plates taken away before the Agnolotti Del Plin arrived and we had to check in on our order. After doing so though, the server was apologetic and gave us clean plates and utensils. Overall, I would return to see what happy hour is like and try the other menu options! :)', \"a fun dinner spot in Fillmore/Pac Heights! it's super lively and does get busy -- we luckily snagged an outdoor booth, but it was still cozy with heaters and intimate lighting.I thought the food itself was good, not terrific; you can definitely find food of similar quality at a lower price elsewhere in the city. I did love the burrata crostini though -- super fresh olive oil and burrata, and the asparagus was a welcome burst of flavor & texture.  overall, a bit expensive for what you get, but worthwhile for a date night / dinner out with friends!\", 'My Italian friend and I loved this place.  We were happy to go to a place with homemade pasta.  Our waitress was sweet, professional and knowledgable.  She introduced us to Sformato, which she described as a spinach flan, but I think it was more like a fine quiche.  It was so delicious with the toasted hazelnuts!  They also had a unique cucumber lemonade type drink. I appreciated when our waitress asked if we had dietary restrictions, so I could request the drink to be low in sugar; the drink was unique, tasty and refreshing.  The two pasta dishes we got, Bucatini and Rigatoncini, were both delicious, albeit a bit similar to each other, both being a touch spicy. My friend got cannolis for dessert and I tasted them-- deliciously light and lemony cream!  We got there early and the place soon filled up with a lively crowd.  I would totally go back again.  A recommendation to the management: some of the tines of the forks were uneven.  When there is time, perhaps these could be straightened out.', \"A night out of town consists of two things: good food and good company. I was lucky to have both on this night. Let's focus on the food. My friend had moved from Dallas to Santa Rosa and had heard about so many good things regarding The Tailor's Son.We finally decided to try the place during an overnight trip to the city. Before heading out to our concert, we decided to grab a bite at The Tailor's Son after scouting the menu and deciding that the items would fill us up. We ordered a few appetizers and main dishes (the pasta was so fulfilling). We left very happy. The place gets super packed with people. Luckily we were able to grab seats at the bar and enjoy the view with the mirrors reflection. Our bartender paid us as much attention as he could as we were hidden behind one of the bar dispensers. The food was prompt so that made up for the delay on drinks and water refills. The area really is lovely and we highly suggest the area and The Tailor's Son. Walkable distance from many night life events but if you prefer grabbing a ride, no shame in it, especially when it's cold out.\", \"Super excited to try out this spot! I got the Agnolotti Del Plin. The pasta had a nice essence of parmigiano reggiano. There is nice comfortable interior decor with outdoor parklet seating. My party sat outside, and it was a little difficult to fet the waiter's attention at times but not terrible. I'd definitely be interested in checking out other menu items.\", \"The menu looks so fun there are food I haven't heard of in other Italian restaurants. We got the sformato which the waitress explained to us to be a spinach savory flan. I love the texture it's kind of spongy and very creamy and delicious. For dessert we got the olive oil cake. The outside crust was sweet and slightly crunchy and paired so well with the vanilla ice cream on the side. For the pasta I got the ragatoncini which was great although not super memorable for me personally. Waiter is attentive and friendly despite it being pretty busy on a Thursday evening. There are some outdoor seating and a lot of indoor seating but it was pretty full so definitely make a reservation before coming.\", \"A good Italian restaurant is hard to come by, in my frank opinion. But The Tailor's Son just knocks it out of the park and squashes and preconceived notions I had about Italian restaurants. This establishment has extremely flavorful food that stays true to it's Italian roots but adds an almost New America twist. You HAVE to get the Burrata Crostini. All the reviews here are not lying. The star of the dish IS THE BREAD. So warm, soft and crispy that holds the creamy burrata perfectly. The pickled green tomatoes and asparagus add the perfect texture and acidity all well rounded dishes have. For our mains, we order the Agnolotti and Risotto Alla Milanese. BOTH EQUALLY AS SCRUMPTIOUS. The agnolotti bursts with flavor and is coated is a light but flavorful sauce. Finally, the risotto. How would I describe it? Creamy. Al dente. And a solid dish of risotto. Is super unique? No. But is it full of flavor and meshes perfectly with the ossobucco? Yes!So what about the ambiance and service? I'll be honest...it's a bit loud in here. I could still hear my friend talking across from me (albeit with a bit of shouting) but this is not one of the establishments you come for an intimate dinner. It's definitely a vibe. Service was excellent as well. It was the right balance of making sure we had everything we needed but not being overbearing. I loved how we could pay via Apple Pay at the end and didn't have to wait for the waiter to swipe our card. Five stars all around!\", \"Definitely an amazing restaurant! Excellent Italian food, the quality was beyond great! The place was so cool, nice seating and has a lovely atmosphere. The servers were prompt and accommodating. The pastas were so  amazing, nice flavors and has great texture. The Agnolotti Del Plin has a creamy flavors. The Burrata Crostini was delicious. The dessert was fantastic. I can't recommend the food enough, it was so great.  Drinks were so cool!\", \"I really love this place. Every time I have friends visiting town, I make sure to take them here. It's great for medium and small groups, and the overall atmosphere is fun and elegant. Both the indoor and outdoor seating is great, especially since it's in such a lively location.The cocktails are delicious - my favorite is the sprezzatura. I don't think I've gone here once without ordering it. Their small veggie places are all amazing - I especially loved the artichokes. The risottos are also a go to, and big enough for 2 to share.\", 'The food was excellent. Quality Italian fare and packed with flavor. The highlight was definitely the CANNELLONI. The cheesecake was light and refreshing.Price: $$Overall: 9.5/10Must get cannelloni', \"Would come here again for the cocktails - we ordered the suit makers sour and it was the most delicious cocktail I ever had! It's also a beautiful drink and the foam on top reminded me of latte art.The agnolotti was also good although it was slightly chewier than I expected - I think if you are not very hungry you could split it with someone.The vibes were also good and the service was great! The waiter we had was new but they were very attentive and overall it was a pleasant experience.\", 'The bar is the best. Great ambiance, excellent food. Open relatively late as well. For a San Francisco water, that is.', \"Great ambiance but the vibe from some of the staff comes off as a bit snooty? Can't really explain how but that's the vibe I get. I've tried:- Calamari (small portion)- Napoletana pizza fritta - Salami pizza fritta (don't get this, super dry and not much flavor)- Bucatini all amatriciana- Cocktails: with Prosecco, Negroni alpino, sprezzaturaOf all these I would recommend the Napoletana, bucatini, and sprezzatura!\", 'Indulge in a delightful evening combining pasta and cocktails.This restaurant takes a hipster approach to classic Italian recipes, drawing in crowds with its vibrant and bustling atmosphere. Their minimalist style complements the top-notch flavors they offer, using only the freshest ingredients. Once they\\'re out, they\\'re out--there\\'s no unlimited \"soup, salad & breadsticks\" here like at some other places.I can personally attest to the risotto and cocktails, a fantastic combination. The carne cruda (tartare toast) also deserves high praise. It was absolutely delicious.', \"Visited for a Friday night date.While not my top choice for Italian cuisine in the city, it's a good pick if you're planning to hang around this neighborhood and hit some bars afterward. The food was tasty but didn't amaze us. Service was efficient even on a seemingly bustling night.They offer a great deal of outdoor seating, which we really appreciated.\", \"Man listen if you need a nice smooth Italian cuisine date this one of them ones food was amazing the wine was good. They know exactly what their doing I'll be back.\", \"Really cute restaurant but overall not the greatest experience. We went for an outdoor brunch over the weekend and ordered the polenta and bucatini. The polenta was a bit bland, but the bucatini was just UNBELIEVABLY salty. The seasoning of both dishes was off and made the food a bit disappointing for me. The service was fine, but nothing spectacular. Might try visiting for dinner another time to see if it's better!\", \"I've been really excited to try this place because each time I walk by, I always do a double take at the stunning interior! The place was absolutely packed on Saturday night. My bf and I came here for our anniversary, and they seated us at a two seater tucked away by the bar. It was lovely and secluded from the crowd. Overall ambiance is very lively yet intimate. Service is pretty good! Our server was really attentive. However, the food came out really slowly and at awkward times. We were already done with our apps for 20 minutes and the entrees were still not delivered. Food was good, but the favorite was the agnolotti pasta. It was creamy, savory, and portions were generous. Wish the sauce had more flavor though. The tuna carpaccio was ok, nothing extraordinary but the fish was fresh. The mushroom risotto was fab - a ton of mushroom, literally 2-3 with every bite. Creamy, warm, and comforting. The crostini was ok, i was not a fan of the jalapenos and bread was slightly too hard.  Overall, solid place to try for the unique ambiance, but for the price point you can find better Italian food in the city!\", \"We stopped in for early Sunday dinner on the last day of the Fillmore Jazz. Busy and most tables filled, thank goodness for Yelp reservations.I dug the several takes on the stalwart Negroni, and will continue to explore their take if we visit again. But one thing that's a minor peeve (and the reason for one star off), is if you're going to offer swordfish, don't overcook it. Dry, flavorless - meh. My wife's pasta entree was quite tasty, and to be fair the accompanying vegetables with my swordfish were wonderfully complex and bursting with flavors. Will we return? There are lots of unexplored options on Fillmore for our next visit. Service was attentive, professional, and timely given the post-festival crush, and we may give The Tailor's Son another try in the near.\", \"I stopped by for lunch on a Sunday and was able to get a table right away! I tried the polenta braise - I LOVE polenta but it's usually hard to find on menus, so I'm glad they serve it here. The polenta was creamy and complemented by pork ragu. The poached eggs were a bit overcooked and too well-done for my liking, but the focaccia was so good - I only wish there was more of it. The interior is beautiful and there is ample outdoor seating. I'll be back to try their dinner menu!\"]\n",

      "Reviews: ['The food were top-notch and has excellent quality.  I like the Vegan Lasagna and Pork cheeks which has nice flavor, it was well-cooked and it taste so fantastic. Everything was well-done.Amazing cocktail drinks. Lovely place, with good lighting, and nice seating inside. It was wonderful place with a pleasant ambiance. The staff were so friendly.', \"We went here for brunch. We sat on the back patio. They have heaters which is nice considering SF is often chilly. The ambience was nice.I ordered the quinoa brunch bowl. It was basically just a big bowl of dry quinoa. My friend ordered the same thing and made the comment she had almost no arugula in it. I think I had 1 piece of cauliflower. Supposedly it had a vinaigrette on it, but I felt it had absolutely no flavor. The worst part is I had hard egg shell in my dish. Thankfully the restaurant took this dish off our bill to compensate, but it kind of ruined the whole meal for me. My husband got the Media Noche Sandwich. He liked it, and I had half and thought it was fine. The dishes are pretty large. Pricing is about $40/couple. I didn't feel very excited about anything on the menu, and probably will not return.\", \"Fable is my go to. It never disappoints for a date night, from the food to the wine selection everything here is on point. This is my go to for every date night because me and my partner always leave pleased. The servers are always friendly and well mannered. Service and food matter and finding a favorite restaurant is hard. This place deserves a A + for effort and I'll always be a loyal customer. Would I recommend- Absolutely\", \"Fable came a bit short of my expectations, unfortunately. The patio for brunch needs to be reserved way in advance, so I wasn't able to check it out, but the parklet in the front was lovely too. I like how this place places a great emphasis on outdoor dining! Service was quite slow. It seems like there were only about two people working, during weekend brunch hours. It took us a long time to get seated even though I noticed that there were vacant tables. The brunch menu was quite limited, and I was disappointed that there wasn't a vegetarian omelet or scramble dish. I ended up getting the chilaquiles, even though that wasn't quite what I was in the mood for at the time. The chilaquiles were good, but I think that if there were more menu options to choose from, I would have had a better experience.\", 'Sammy and Wine   On my day trip to The Castro area of SF, we started with a small bite and afternoon splash.  Waitress was helpful in picking best of the sandwiches (her favorite was the turkey). Perfect focaccia bread, toasted turkey, meaty cheese, smooth avocado  paired the Sammy with a bottom of white wine and could not be happier.  We got sat in the back courtyard and let me tell you about serene. It was cozy with an open roof to the sky.  Beautiful. Will be back for lunch again tomorrow', \"I came here for brunch with a friend in their backyard patio. It was decorated with vibrant colors, definitely a vibe, and it also got pretty hot from the greenhouse effect of their roof as it was a rare sunny day in SF this July. The server was great with refilling our water.I got a generous portion of perfectly runny Eggs Benedict with crispy potatoes, and my friend got the Fried Chicken Sandwich (not pictured) with a margarita. Would love to come back when I'm not hungover to try their cute drinks!\", 'We came here for a work dinner and sat in the patio.The patio was an unexpected pretty oasis in the middle of the inner city.Service was delightful.We had a prefix menu and I got the steak, which was done perfectly. The macaroni and cheese side was delicious. I also really enjoyed their melon salad.We brought our own alcohol, which was nice. Not sure if we were charged a corkage fee. It was a lovely evening and I would definitely return on my own.', \"Note: If you're looking at the hours on here, they're incorrect. They're open for brunch everyday except for Sat & Sun from 11:30 am to 3 pm and dinner everyday from 5 pm to 10 pm! Happy hour 3 pm to 6 pm.Okay, let's get into it.. food was alright! The oven roasted chicken was good, nothing that was a wow factor but good and did the job! Loved the focaccia bread that it came on! The double cheeseburger is on the smaller side and cooked about medium! Same thing, wasn't a wow factor but didn't dislike it either. Fries came out perfectly hot and crispy! Service was great. Open seating on a Thursday in their back patio. Loved the lushness in the back and how happy it made you feel! Great ambience for a day out with friends or a day date!\", \"This nice place to go on a Sunday for brunch. They have plenty of seating outdoors, so you don't have to wait long. They are attentive and offer proper service. The food was delicious. I got the salmon with  greens. There was plenty of it too. Make sure your entire party is there before seating. I will be coming back.\", 'My friends and I booked a large table in the back of Fable on a Friday night. It was ideal to eat as a group - they did ask us to place our orders all at once. They have a cute backyard with heat lamps, which you would never know from the street looking at the storefront.I got the pan roasted Rocky Jr chicken, which I give 4/5 stars. The chicken was tender and perfectly cooked and the salad was luscious and full of delicious plums, apricots, and homemade croutons. The chicken was not super flavorful but overall a great dish.Two of my friends got the vegan lasagna which I tried - it came with a spicy red sauce, delicious noodles with bits of zucchini and vegan cheese crumble on top. Personally, I think the sauce had a little too much pepper/salt but my non-Italian friends both loved it. Would definitely recommend for vegans. My other friend got the pan seared salmon with quinoa and absolutely adored it.Lastly there is the mac and cheese, which is so hard to find in the Bay Area. The whole table adored this side dish, which was topped with Parmesan cheese. As a mac and cheese aficionado, I would come back just for this.', 'No Fees', 'Quick and helpful servers. Enjoyed the brussel sprouts, vegan lasagna, and swordfish the most.', 'Had a fun and delicious brunch here with friends over pride weekend! I had the omelette with artichokes and veggies, and we all shared a carafe of sangria. The food and drinks were delicious.We were also seated on an outdoor patio that was very bright and pretty. Definitely loved the space too.', \"I hadn't been to Fable in a long time and was back again recently. The first time was great and had gotten the pork chop. This time I got the mussels. Portion was big, bread that came with it was also filling, and mussels and broth were flavorful. We tried the chocolate dessert and strawberry shortcake. The shortcake texture was light and not heavy or dry. The filling/strawberries were soft and good balance. The chocolate was light and not overly sweet which I appreciated. We sat on the back patio which is really cute and had heat lamps. Our server checked on us and was patient as we were slow to order. Definitely recommend and hope to come back sooner than last time\", 'This place is a really wonderful spot to grab wine, cocktails, or dinner in the Castro.  There is a wonderful courtyard in the middle with a tiki feel that adds to the chill vibe of the place.  The menu is very good and vegetarian friendly, and there are non-alcoholic wines and cocktails in addition to the fully-leaded variety.  Highly recommended.', 'Not bad but not amazing either. The food is okay. I had the breakfast sandwich (egg and cheese) and it fell apart. Not much flavor. Server kind of interrupted our conversations a lot but I understand she had a job to do. We were on the back porch in a place people were coming in and out and the ground was uneven. Staff kept smacking into us or tripping on the uneven pavement. Not my favorite brunch spot.', 'Visited for Saturday brunch. We had made advance reservations so we were seated soon after arrival.Our order:- mimosa - very good- Chilaquiles - good- Veggie omelette - good- Chocolate chip banana bread - okayishOverall, we liked the food and the staff was very friendly. The garden-like ambience of their outdoor patio is great and also very dog friendly. I can see myself visiting again for trying out other items on their menu.', \"Grilled local rock cod tacos were delicious. The fish meat was steaming warm and filling, and the flavors were on point. The citrus and endive salad with roasted pistachio vinaigrette (with crab meat add-on!) was great too. The salad was light, refreshing, and flavorful, and as a non-SF local, I was really impressed with how fresh the crab meat was. I'm really glad we decided to add the crab meat--I think it's definitely a must-get!The outdoor patio environment is really cute, but one con: it's very noisy. Very cute spot for a date if you don't mind talking loudly/straining to listen to other people. Either that or learn some ASL :)\", 'Overall Experience: 5Food: 5Service: 5Atmosphere: 5Value: depends Pros: The serving sizes for our entrees were HUGE. Definitely more than enough food. Also, the mussels appetizer is such a good deal and so delicious. The flavors of the appetizers and entrees were spot on and included some very interesting ingredients! The atmosphere of the outdoor dining space was super adorable and made for the perfect romantic date night. Cons: The stuffed fish was around $36 and although it was good, this is pretty pricey compared to their other menu items. The bathroom also felt a little dirty. Their desserts were not the best in my opinion and were far pricier than their other menu items. If I were to come here again, I would definitely skip the dessert menu.', 'Super cute outdoor dining area.  Food was good and service was also good. Nice spot for a date night.', 'Service  Food Ambiance  Food was cool & portions acceptable, staff service or front desk attendant was publicly rude to myself and my friends with seating.', 'No Fees', \"Looked up popular brunch spots in the area and saw this one. Decided to give it a try and it did not disappoint. Patio seating was lovely. It does get hot, and awnings don't cover the whole space. Service was helpful. Had the fennel cured trout eggs benedict, eggplant caponata omelette with breakfast potatoes, fable's sweet baguette french toast, and mimosas. Favorites were the french toast (caramelized peaches which were not too sweet) and eggs benedict! Food wasn't mindblowing but everything was cooked well and flavored nicely.Cured trout eggs benedict: $22Eggplant caponata omelette with breakfast potatoes: $15Fable's sweet baguette french toast: $16Mimosa: $35\", \"Fable is in the Castro.  I went there with my wife and some friends for brunch. We didn't have a reservation and showed up right when they opened, so understandably they seated reservations first, but we were able to get a table, the manager said he could make it work if we ate and left within an hour because they had another reservation scheduled.We sat in their outdoor covered patio which was really nice and pretty sturdy, it was raining while we were there and we were dry as a bone.Our server recommended their chocolate banana bread which was super yummy, I love how banana and zucchini breads for example have so much sugar in them that probably evens out at health content the fruits or veggies had. I really enjoyed the Fried Chicken Sandwich and their fries were pretty good too. I'd try it again, maybe make a reservation next time.\", \"Went for brunch and the service was great! If you have a reservation, you'll need to make sure most of your party is there because they won't give you the table otherwise. They hold reservations for 10 minutes only. Our server was great! The restaurant has a backyard and it's perfect for a sunny day in the city. It has plants and has a great ambiance. The space has heaters.The food was great too. We ordered the dishes below and would definitely recommend for brunch:- chilaquiles- egg sandwich- quinoa boal- grapefruit juice\", 'The ambience is just incredible at this cute brunch spot. Loved my Chilaquiles which is high praise because I usually find this dish too tomato-y. This one was perfectly done and topped with a fluffy egg and cheese. Sangria was super strong as well!', 'I had lunch here a few weeks ago and it was great. The patio here was calm and quiet. It was nice to sit and relax for a late afternoon bite.I loved the attentive service and chill ambience.', \"Holiday weekend & all the restaurants were packed. Wandering around the Castro looking for a late lunch and saw Fable. I wasn't sure about this place cause nobody was in the parklet & it looked so dark inside. Who knew, there's an awesome outdoor patio in back. That's where everyone was. I noticed a lot of wine & beer day drinking, hence, the merry mood.Loved the setting, large overhead, vine covered trellis, lots of light. I ordered my twice a year hamburger- so going all the way with the 1/2 lb double cheeseburger, side of fries. Man, so delicious, the fries were crispy & lightly salted. The burger was dripping cheese, elevated with dill pickle, lettuce, & tomato. I skipped the aioli, cause, yuck. My friend got the Caesar with added chicken. He didn't like the chicken, turned off cause the strips were green. I guess he doesn't like pesto & regretted he didn't get the fried chicken salad, which he enjoyed last time.We were given a large carafe of water and iced black tea refills.With tip we paid about $75. Yipes. But I will definitely come back on a nice day & sit in the outdoor patio.\", 'Picked Fable for a birthday brunch with a group of 10 because it was one of the few brunch places in SF I could find that accepted reservations.The back patio is pretty cute, and though it was rainy we were completely covered and dry. The menu has a range of options for various tastes/preferences and everyone seemed to enjoy the food. We shared the banana bread and enjoyed it, and I was very full/satisfied after eating my fried chicken sandwich.Service was nice/friendly as well!', \"The restaurant itself is beautiful and super pretty, and the service is great. The fondue was good, would've preferred thicker chips or a heavier fondue, it was pretty watery. The chicken was great in my opinion, cooked really well and loved the filling. I would order again. The jerk pork shank seemed more braised than anything, and we were not told ahead of time that they were out of brussel sprouts and pancetta, which is part of why the dish was ordered versus another. It was a hearty portion which was nice. The halibut was the least flavorful and not a favorite.\", \"Although I've heard many good things about brunch here I've never been for brunch. We did go for dinner yesterday and had a great dining experience. The food was very delicious with a very delightful ambience and environment. We had dinner in the rear garden, which is very nice. They also have some tables on the street which I can imagine are nice as well, but they're not as elegant or entertaining. We had the muscles which were done perfectly ask for extra bread. Make sure to make reservations\", 'Love this place, great food, service. Love the garden.  A favorite brunch spot for us.', 'No Fees', 'Fable always has great food and ambiance. The service is impeccable. If you can, request a table in the back patio. Make sure you try one of their daily specials. Also they allow dogs in the patio, so your furry friends are welcome here.', \"I had a wonderful 2nd experience at Fable. The first time I came for brunch a few months ago. Both times we had excellent service.Today, my partner arrived 10 minutes early and the host was very kind. He had asked if we had reservations (we did not), but very kindly let us know that they'd be open shortly. Once the outdoor back patio was ready, he came and got us from out front of the restaurant. By the way, if you ever have the option to eat indoors or out in the back patio...GO TO THE PATIO! It's beautifully set with seating surrounded by greenery and covered in shade. The first time I came here it was lightly raining and it was BEAUTIFUL to sit out there and listen to the rain while eating. Today was a Thursday and by 6pm, the restaurant was filling quickly. Might be best to make reservations. Just in case. I want to highlight the host for a second in hopes that the manager sees this. He sat an elderly couple next to us and was EXTREMELY patient and kind. The elderly woman had accidentally knocked over the seat cushion from the bench. She was using a cane to walk with and couldn't get it from the floor herself. He helped get it back from behind the bench and placed it for her. It was just a very genuine act of human kindness and was pleased to see the great employees they hire here.Now...for the food. Oh. My. Goodness. The waiter suggested we try the Roasted Maitake, King Trumpet & Pink Oyster Mushroom Toast. It was full of flavor and beautifully plated. We also ordered the 12 oz Grilled NY Strip Steak and the Pan Seared Alaskan Halibut. Everything was cooked to perfection. One thing I love about this place is that the menu seems to change which is great for variety. I can't wait to come back again and try something new!\", \"Our group of three came here for Sunday brunch and were able to be seated outside in the parklet immediately. Note that the back patio is only available by reservation. For food, I had a steak benedict. I loved how the egg and steak were served on top of focaccia. It was tasty and not too heavy. The chocolate chip banana bread was a nice sweet treat as well. I got a iced coffee, which felt a bit watered down for my taste. The outside parklet was cute, and I loved the plant theme throughout the restaurant. Our server was friendly, and the food came out quickly.  I later realized that we were incorrectly charged extra for part of our order, so I left a voicemail with the restaurant. I didn't hear back after a few days, so I called again and was put in touch with the manager who quickly corrected the charge which I really appreciated!\", 'It\\'s all about the backyard.  On a sparkling sunny day following the season\\'s 11th atmospheric river, Fable\\'s backyard patio was the place to be.  With my party of 8, we walked through the restaurant\\'s interior to emerge in the backyard space and I heard audible gasps of joy from some in my group who were surprised in the best of ways.  The backyard space is a charmer.As a Castro Street regular who is generally dining solo while in the area, Fable has never risen to the top of my list.  It seems more of a splurge place than a solo dining spot but I\\'m happy to report that the splurge is very reasonable considering 2023 restaurant prices.  Here, meal-sized salads, burgers, and other menu items can be had at lunch for under $20.  This was a most pleasant surprise given the surroundings and the fact that Fable is a full-service restaurant.  I didn\\'t take a poll, but my hunch - based on my personal experience - is that the backyard is the reason you go here and the food is nice accompaniment.  My Cobb Salad ($18) was well composed and hosted a satisfying array of fresh, quality ingredients.  At my table, all food was consumed but we failed to reach the \"ooh\" and \"aah\" of truly memorable food; that was reserved for the setting.  I was happily pleased with Fable.  The reason to enjoy a meal there is the opportunity to sit in that attractive, leafy, green backyard.  The meal is your price of admission.', 'Loved the patio! I just wished they had music there too. The food was delicious, and service was great.', \"Meh. Very pleasant patio and nice service. But the tap water had a really odd taste, which added about $10 in bottled substitutes to our tab. The fried chicken in the sandwich was greasy and the Caesar salad we split was tasty but not like any Caesar dressing I've ever had - more a mustard vinaigrette. For $78 pre-tip, I would not return.\", 'Ive been excited to come to Fable for some time since they take reservations and have a beautiful patio! I had made reservations for 2 on the weekend, and we were seated on the patio. The menu online had shown lattes and other coffees, but when we asked the server we were told they only had straight espresso. I had asked if they could pour it over ice and bring a side of almond milk but was told no. I found that to be very odd.I ordered the omelette, it was over cooked and covered in salsa (not mentioned on the menu). The potatoes were also covered in so much seasoning it was all I could taste on the plate. My friend had ordered the French toast, she said it was good but nothing special and the way it was served was hard to eat. If I was in the area, I would give Fable another try but unfortunately I was not impressed with my first visit.', 'Make reservations!While we awaited the opening, a few people strolled. by and mentioned that this is one of the best restaurants on the Castro.We sat on the beautiful outdoor garden patio next to a trickling fountain.  We ordered the peaches with housemade ricotta, NY steak, .and a cheeseburger. The starter of peaches and housemade ricotta was innovative and memorable.Our burger was brought with cheese (we had asked without), but while they corrected it, we devoured the steak, which was delicious. The Au gratin potatoes were especially good. The burger was fairly pedestrian.', 'The red quinoa bowl - served warm - is delicious and surprisingly filling. The \"not so skinny\" Paloma is deceiving. At first I couldn\\'t taste the alcohol. But half an hour later it hit me hard!They have one of the prettiest patios in San Francisco. Brunch for 4, plus 2 drinks - $130 before tax and tip.', \"Love a good brunch and this spot was perfect for a sunday brunch with our group of 5. We had a reservation and I love that they do take reservations when many places don't!Food was good, not my most favorite though! Most notable options were the egg sandwich and the friend chicken sandwich. So yummy! Pro Tip: Def add an egg to the chicken sandwich!Coffee selection is limited to just hot or cold coffee - but drink selections looked amazing!! There's a 75min table limit depending on the line for brunch, so be aware if you plan to just hang for a while.Also HUGE plus is their patio is pet friendly!!

It's also run by a family, and you can tell they really care about the quality of both the food and their service.Every dish we had was packed with flavor and consisted of delicious, high-quality ingredients. It was clear from every bite that the chefs put a lot of care and attention into the dishes served.One of the aunties told us that their cooking comes from a central region in Thailand, where the spice level lies somewhat in the middle of the North and South's. Personally, I found that the dishes we ordered did have a pleasant middle heat.We will 100% be coming back!\", \"Best new Thai restaurant in SF! I love love love Thai food and have been itching for a new spot since Farmhouse Thai is hard to get to from Marin. This new spot blew our group of five away - they took a day-of reservation no problem (we called in to get the larger group at the right time as opentable was limited), were flexible when we were running 15 mins late, and had lovely, attentive service. With a great spread for both vegetarians and meat lovers, Oraan felt authentic but still approachable. We shared three appetizers and a papaya salad, and each ordered an entree - we left pleasantly stuffed with leftovers. The Christmas decorations and overall ambiance were cozy and added to the vibe. Can't wait to come back soon!\", \"So glad we came here! My fiancé and I came on a Friday night. We got seated immediately. Service was great, the servers were tentative. We ordered the fried chicken, papaya salad, pad Thai and the sukho Thai noodle. Everything was delicious. The papaya salad was medium spicy and just gave the perfect kick. The fried chicken was fried to perfection. The key lime cream on top was delicious and paired perfectly with the fried chicken. Similarly with the fried kale. Entree: the paid Thai and the sukho was good too. Both tasted yummy however the pad Thai was a bit sweet. I did crave a bit more spiciness. The decor was nice on the inside. Gave Christmas and festive vibes. They have a great selection of food. So we can't wait to come back!\", \"Last minute dinner spot that I thought was delicious and worth visiting again for a special occasion (you can find cheaper Thai food in the city). I appreciated the unique items on the menu. I chose an appetizer as my main meal and was happy I did. The gai manow was a fried chicken topped with a citrus sauce. I've never had anything like it and I'm glad I gave it a shot. I'd go back just for this. Ginger rice was a great side to go with the dish.\", 'Upon recommendations, we made dinner reservations for last Friday night at Orran. Parking right out front for convenience. We were greeted when we walked in and noticed many small tables in a cozy, intimate setting. I would say the service was the best! We were asked if we had questions about the menu, we were given instructions on what dip goes good with the food and definitely was checked up on several times throughout dinner. The menu had appetizers, soups, salads, entrees, noodles/rice and dessert. It had a lot of typical main Thai dishes you would normally recognize. I ordered the Hoi Jor which is the deep fried crab meet with pork and plum sauce. I also ordered the chicken Thai Fried Rice. The chicken in the fried rice had a hard texture, not my favorite. Lastly, we shared the Gal Himmaparn which is crispy fried chicken with cashews, bell peppers, basil and onions. All dishes arrived together and quick quickly actually! I was hoping the appetizer would come out first so we can enjoy a bite first before the entrees. Either way, it was the quickest cooking ever! Good Thai style food, authentic, fresh and good flavors. A good spot for dinner if you are craving thai flavors.', \"The place was nicely-decorated and each table had a candle. The staff were very welcoming and helpful with ordering since we couldn't decide what to get. Many of the dishes were new to us and not the typical dishes at most Thai restaurants. We ordered: - Gal Manow: wow the outside layer was super crunchy and the chicken was moist. The sauce was tart and creamy, with a slight sour aftertaste. Even if you don't like sour foods, I would def recommend trying this dish bc the flavors are well-balanced and you barely taste the sourness. The fried Chinese broccoli was similar to seaweed and a great crunchy addition to the dish.- Sukho Thai Noodle: I mostly got this one bc of the variety of meats and toppings with the noodles. The pork belly kept its crunchiness, even though it was a bit wet from the soup. The noodles were cooked well, not overcooked. The soup was a bit sour and spicy, very delicious. Wish it came with a bit more noodles though. Overall, this place is delicious and the friendly staff made the experience even better! I will come back to try other traditional Thai dishes and would def recommend this place!\", \"I'm blown away with how delicious this Thai spot is. The parking around this area may be troublesome but it is well worth the trip. Servers greeted my boyfriend and I right away and we got promptly seated.The noodle soup (5/5) the noodles were perfectly cooked and the broth was umami and packed with flavor. The different variations of pork offered each bite a new texture and flavor which made this dish even more enjoyable.Tom Kha (5/5) Sweet, sour and creamy. Can't go wrong with this soup.Thai ice tea with coconut milk (4/5) The thai tea itself was delicious but I would probably not get it with the coconut milk next time. The concoction was foreign to me and didn't fit my palate.Not only is the food good, the portion size is humongous. I can't wait to come back to try the other dishes they have to offer.\", 'My new local Thai Restaurant! The KAPOW MOO KROB is delicious!   And generous portion of the Coconut Ice Cream', \"You need to try this place! I am almost compelled to say this is my FAVORITE Thai restaurant in the city. The prices are very reasonable for San Francisco. The dishes are unique, high quality, and large. The service has a hint of the welcoming and sweet hospitality you get in Thailand. All around a solid new Thai restaurant in San Francisco that I think the city desperately needs. In terms of dishes, everything we order was out of this world. The Gai Manow was so crispy and the tart lemon cream sauce paired well with the crispy greens. I have never heard of a dish like this before, but it is definitely a must try when you come to this restaurant. The Sukho Thai Noodle was PACKED with various meats and the crispy pork was SO CRISPY. I would come back to this restaurant just for that! The Nuer Marakot and Laab were solid dishes as well. Not as stand out as the first two but the Nuer Marakot is a great dish if you are looking for a solid beef dish and the Laab Gai is a great starter with great fresh ingredients. As I said before, service was great! Servers were super friendly, super attentive about filling our water, and made the experience so great. Since the restaurant is fairly new, it was very easy to get a reservation at 7pm on a Wednesday evening -- hopefully things get packed and busy for them soon. You can easily make a reservation on OpenTable. Ambiance was super laid back as well. The restaurant is decorated very nicely (think BoHo Thai modern) and have a bright welcoming reception environment. It's a great place for a first date or a nice dinner with friends. I had heard from a server they were able to accommodate a party of 20 a couple days ago. Mark my words, YOU NEED TO TRY THIS PLACE!!!! You won't regret it.\", 'One of the best Thai experience I\\'ve had! Because it\\'s not only the food, but the whole experience with this new restaurant is what all Thai restaurants should aspire to be. Ambiance, aesthetic, presentation were all top notch.This is a top class operation.The menu is quite comprehensive and diverse. From the young papaya salad to fruit salad to deep fried battered chicken served with lemon cream sauce (Gai Manow) to crudités of raw vegetables served with coconut dipping sauce (Lon Kung).This evening I\\'ve had a delicious Thai style longan juice beverage which was refreshing with fresh longan fruits, mint leaves and hint of brown sugar. I also had the \"Som tum pon la mai\" fruit salad, it was vibrant, sweet, sour, fresh, nutty, crunchy, fish sauce, explosion of flavor, you will love this!For my main course I\\'ve had \"Nuer Marakot\" which is marinated beef with Thai eggplants. Wow! Fatty, meaty, bold, complex, the Thai eggplants are cooked but still crunchy and the bamboo shoots are such great compliment to this dish. You like Thai green curry? You WILL LOVE this dish!I really wanted to try their mango and sticky rice dessert, but I was so full.Maybe next week or maybe tomorrow, I like this place so that is for sure.Aesthetically pleasing to the eyes from the ambience, utensils down to the food presentation.Service was great, the staff actually approach and attempt to have a conversation with you / the customers, unlike many other typically Thai restaurants staff who are either too shy or not really talking to their customers.I would recommend this restaurant highly to my colleagues (even to my Thai friends at work) and my hotel clients.This place is one of the restaurant where I would happily spend my money at.', \"New Thai restaurant. Food and service is very good. Well, the pad tai is a bit too sweet for me. The rest of the items are very good but very strong flavor. You cannot eat the food on its own. You will need to eat it with white rice. My favorite is the appetizer fried crispy chicken with sauce on top and their A La carte  fried crispy shrimp with tamarin is really good. The shrimp is so crispy that you literally can eat the whole shell too. Which we did. Overall we all enjoyed our meal. One last note, it's not cheap but good to try once in a while.\", 'Welcome new addition to the Thai food scene in the Inner Richmond. So many new and unusual dishes to choose from. Of the three dishes we ordered, only tom ka gai soup was familiar. The soup was loaded with white meat chicken, fabulous mushrooms, and a rich coconut broth--too much for the two of to finish. Another tasty dish was a deconstructed salad with a shrimp and pepper spread that could be smeared on lettuce and cabbage leaves and adorned with carrots and cucumbers. The final dish was pork four ways: pork shoulder, roast pork, ground pork, and grilled pork belly in a somewhat spicy brown sauce over rice vermicelli noodles. If you are looking for a unique Thai experience, give Oraan a try.', 'I love Thai food and always up for checking out new places. I finally tried Oraan Thai after passing by so many times. The authentic Thai food here was absolutely delicious and beautifully presented using Thai ingredient herbs for decorations. The service was the warmest hospitality. This place such a chill spot , nice and relaxing to catch up with friends, the ambience is great not too loud like any others.I enjoyed Kung Makam ( the crunchy prawns with tamarind sauce) and Hormokbaitong ( steam mixed seafood in red curry sauce.Menu choices very interesting and unique. I would highly recommend this restaurant.', \"We came here after a great Thai massage 5 blocks away. We are keeping the theme Thai today!And Oraan Thai did not disappoint. We started with the Curry Puffs for appetizers as recommended by the wait staff. The crust is perfect in texture with a very slight sweetness to it. The filling was tasty and plentiful. The curry sauce to dip it in complemented the crust and filling perfectly.The Spicy Pork Ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender and very delicious! They provide you plastic gloves for the ribs. I wasn't sure if it was because it would be fiery like Korean chicken or because it was messy. Turns out it's messy but still medium spicy. The Vegetable Curry was yummy, the sauce delectable. I had the Butterfly Pea Strawberry Lemonade and hubby had the Thai coffee.The service was excellent. The employees are very attentive, friendly, helpful. They are great at topping off your water glass which is great as some dishes are spicy. The ambiance is perfect for a date or family oriented. It is spacious and clean, very nicely decorated. This restaurant was formerly Mescolanza.  We enjoyed our experience here quite a lot, the food is very good. We will definitely return.\", \"23.09.23.

My family and I were blown away by the food here. Every dish didn't disappoint and the service was incredible. They checked in with us, and asked a lot of feedback on their dishes, which we let them know were a 10/10. We left dinner feeling full and knowing this is now our favorite Thai spot!I super recommend getting the crispy pork belly and the fried chicken appetizer with the crispy Chinese broccoli! We couldn't stop thinking about those dishes when we left. This is a neighborhood gem for sure.\", 'The food is very delicious. It has a clean atmosphere and the employees are very friendly. I believe this was an Italian restaurant before. First of all, the food tastes good, so I recommend it.I ate the food recommended by the server and it was a very good choice.', \"The best fruit salad I've ever had. If you want to wake up, please try this one. I ate it with fried eggplants, which are also popular here.\", \"New, bright Thai spot on Geary near Arguello with excellent service and fresh, delicious food.  The smoked salmon/avappetizer was the perfect start to a wonderful lunch of crispy pork belly and pad see shrimp.  Don't miss the sticky rice and mango\", \"Beautiful interior, calming music, and friendly staff.Enjoyed everything we ordered:1. Curry puffs - Abundantly filled. Flaky on the outside, soft on the inside. Paired with a mild peanut sauce and a refreshing cucumber relish. The cucumber relish was not too sweet or sour.2. Nuer Marakot - Never had this dish before, and learned  that green curry has more of a kick. The beef was tender and flavorful. Eggplant and other vegetables in the dish were delicious. I appreciated the portion of this dish.3. Sukho Thai Noodle - Loved all the flavor this soup noodle had to offer. It's sweet, sour, and just opens up your appetite. The roast pork was very crunchy. But my favorite part is the soup. I would love just a bowl of noodles and this soup haha.\", 'Wonderful food, amazing service and beautiful decor. Oraan looks like a hole in the wall from the outside. But inside it is modern and simply beautiful. We ordered all appetizers and they were massive portions and delish! Our favorite by far was the Gai Manow (Crispy battered chicken, smothered in a creamy citrus sauce) I would describe it like a fluffy chicken nugget with the perfect cream sauce.Staff was kind and attentive. I will absolutely be coming back here.', \"My partner and I dined here last evening, what a pleasant experience in service and flavors!The servers were attentive without hovering.We started with the fruit salad and were amazed by the complexity of flavor coupled with sweet and spicy finishes. I had the Pad See Eew (I've been looking for a replacement ever since Derm changed hands) I was not disappointed! absolutely spot on and a large portion. My Partner had the Pad Thai, says it's the best he's ever had and again a large portion. We'll be back and we're bringing guests!\", \"Oraan is better than great, it's chic, to begin with--the silverware is golden!-- and had the perfect table for my lunch today, with a view across Geary to Dumpling Baby and, across Third Ave., to Toyota... i took one look at the menu and decided i would just start with two appetizers and work my way down on my next visits. delicious. exquisite.i would want to save this place for myself, but it seems big enough (two rooms) to handle the crowds it will surely draw.\", 'Wonderful meal at these brand new restaurant in the city.  Everything we had was spot on.  Immaculately clean with pleasant decor.  Service was great!  We met the entire lovely family that owns this restaurant!  Go there now.  Soon it will be hard to get reservations!', \"excellent service. nice decor. Food menu is limited and needs some improvement. went there twice. Eggplant dish had too much oil, veggies dish  wasn't  cooked enough and beef had way too much grizzle. We will stick to soups, salads and noodle dishes for now.\", 'The food was really good. They only have beer or wine. The place is very nice. Only street parking available. And reserving ahead of time is a better option. They are usually booked. The service was very nice as well.', 'Food was very flavorful. The place is very nice and modern. The curry puff is tasty. And the pork shoulder was very delicious and authentic.', 'Had a very tasty dinner here! Service was great. We really enjoyed the Thai hot and sour soup and crispy pork belly. The pad Thai kung Mae Nam was also delicious. Each of the dishes was unique and tasted fresh.', 'Authentic Thai food with a tasty, unique twist. The beef with green curry sauce was my favorite']\n",

      "Reviews: ['Great Mexican food & drinks in the Castro area!Food & Drink - loved our Palomas, margaritas, & all of the plates we ordered. Ceviche was so fresh & delicious. Lots of classic options!Service - nothing memorable but also nothing bad.Ambiance - indoor & outdoor seating, sitting outdoors places you in the center of Castro with a great view of everything going on.Would go back & absolutely would recommend as a great option for a quick bite of Mexican food & some well-crafted cocktails when in Castro!', \"Came here on a Monday night with a friend to catch up and found out it was Margarita Mondays, what a win! I got the mango one which was good but I'd drink it fast if you don't want it to end up watered down. We got the Esquites, Mexican Wings, and Flautas. All of them were good but I'd say the wings stood out the most to me. Overall, it's a decent Mexican restaurant but definitely a little modernized. The service was nice and attentive but not suffocating. I'm sure this place is a lot more lively as we draw closer to the end of the week.\", \"I went here to meet a friend for dinner after doing a Barry's workout and it was a nice and quick experience! Good:- Fast service! Food came out in like 10 minutes? - Nice comfortable seating inside- I was a big fan of the chicken enchilada and the fried cauliflower it came with was really tasty too Bad:- Not too much service Overall this place was a nice find near Barry's!\", \"My friends and I came here last night before going to a comedy show and enjoyed it. It was a Thursday night around 730 and it was pretty busy. We ended up being sat outside and it turned out to be lovely. They do have heat lamps and it is quite warm.The plates are small, but it's great for sharing and you get to try more than one thing. There were three of us, and we ordered the flautas, empanadas, Tinga quesadilla, crispy cauliflower, corn, patatas and queso fundito. We really enjoyed the empanadas, the quesadilla, crispy cauliflower and patatas bravas the most. The queso was boring and needed more flavor. We liked the chips but it felt like we got the bottom of the bag. Lots of small broken ones and the flautas were also fairly plain. The drinks, service and ambiance were the best part and for that reason, I'd likely come back but maybe just for a small snack and a drink instead of dinner.\", \"Stopped by for brunch and really loved the ambiance of this place. They offer bottomless mimosas for $30 I believe. You can mix and match flavors; the guava mimosa was my favorite flavor. The staff is friendly and efficient. For food we ordered chilaquiles, avocado toast, and arroz con leche.Chilaquiles 7.5/10- they weren't drenched in salsa as most chilaquiles are. The texture was harder and crunchier than used to. The beans were good and the steak was well marinated and flavorful. Avocado toast 10/10- I personally liked them a lot and they tasted super good with the beans. It was also a lot more filling than I anticipatedArroz con leche - 3/10 i wasn't a huge fan of this. It's a super small serving so don't order this as ur main meal. This is more of an appetizer or even an after brunch dessert. I thought it lacked flavor and was pretty bland.\", \"A bit disappointed here. Came here after trying to find a fancy ish Mexican restaurant and loved the looks of the happy hour deals here. Unfortunately, I thought everything we ordered was mediocre at best. The service was good, but the food was lacking in flavor and quality. We ordered the margarita pitcher and it was 4-5 margs at best. So there is no point in ordering a pitcher if your goal is to save money. It's the same price as ordering one Marg at a time. Nachos - 6/10 (the nachos at Westwood are much better...yes Westwood, the country bar in the marina)Esquites - 4/10 (I have had better esquites everywhere I have ordered them, the corn tastes like canned corn if I'm being honest)Flautas - 7/10 (the meat just does not seem like good quality)Brussels sprouts - 8/10 (the Brussels sprouts themselves are delicious, but no sauce??? What's up with that. No aioli, salsa, balsamic nothin)Don't think we will be coming back, but the ambience was great and the place was full by the time we left. Just sucks spending $100+ at happy hour for mid quality food. P.S. I am from SoCal so maybe I am a harsh critique when it comes to Mexican. Comment or DM me for ideas for great, fancy Mexican in sf!\", \"Taco Tuesdays, delicious mezcal dranks, and cute and colorful vibes with quality service! Santeria is a gem.Came through with a girlfriend for some tacos on a chill weekday evening. We had hoped to catch their happy hour which is M-F 3-6pm, but we had missed it. HOWEVER, we LOVED that they had a gorgeous Taco Tuesday deal which is 3 tacos for $10, or two tacos and a shot OR beer for $12. QUALITY deals, we love to see it. Their mushrooms taco is subpar, but the chicken and lamb are so flavorful. Highly recommend the shredded juicy chicken. Mm! Our server was so sweet and kind, while I was waiting he made sure to prep me with some chips and salsa (three of a kind). Chips were so warm and on the thinner and crispy side. I wouldn't say the three tacos left us feeling full, but it was a great combo with our delicious drinks.I loved the Santeria. It's their namesake, so the drink was a must. LOVED the mix of smoke mezcal and tequila. The black lava salt really made the presentation pop! The interior is so colorful and cozy, and you really feel like you're ready to have a fiesta but still feel the eleganza of the gorgeous bar and high ceiling. I could also hear my friend during our dining experience, and we loved that it was casual cute--no need to dress up. We parked in Duboce area and walked over, and Santeria was so easy to find. You'll feel taken care of here.Come to Santeria for yummy tequila and mezcal drinks and treat yourself on a Tuesday.\", 'I had bookmarked Santeria on my YELP collection for SF to try when in the neighborhood. So on a beautiful Saturday evening, when we were done with a long walk in the city,  we decided to try them. The restaurant is right on Market street in the heart of Castro. They had indoor and outdoor seating, but seemed the most diners opted for the comfortable outdoor tables.Our server was very efficient, friendly and helpful. We ordered the Lamb Birria Quesadilla, Slow roasted lamb birria on a handmade flour tortilla with melted Monterey Jack cheese, served with a side of  consomé, Enchiladas Verdes ($17)2 chicken enchiladas, creamy green tomatillo sauce, melted cheese, a drizzle of crema, served with side of crispy cauliflower, and BBQ nachos. It was a perfect selection of dishes that made it a very  enjoyable meal experience. The food had a very delicate yet flavorful taste. It was just perfect. Wish we had room for dessert, we need to go back and try them as well.I am sure on a cold day, dining indoors will be amazing as well, as you can see from the pictures, the inside is a high glam and tastefully decorated setting. Will be back and done indoors next time...', 'Went by tonight, after a hair salon appt. They are still putting out delicious carnitas tacos & margaritas. I had the Happy Hour carnitas tacos (2), a cucumber & basil margarita. Perfect quick early dinner & cocktail. We also have had the chicken quesadilla which was tasty. Another 5  trip!', \"Legit Mexican spot with good food. I love the outdoor seating, it always seems slow inside and busy on the outdoor patio. Service has been fast in the times I've been. I've tried the birria quesadilla and I really liked it. The flavor was good and I would order it again. The chips given for the guac was good, they're thick but they don't give very much.\", \"They are super busy during happy hours and the weekend and only accept reservations Monday-Thursday from 3-8:15pm. If you're trying to get there for happy hour and you don't have a reservation, I highly suggest you go early to put your name on the list because you can be waiting for an hour+ for a table. 6 of us went to Santeria on Cinco De Mayo around 5. We were seated around 6ish.Once we got a seat and had a chance to review the menu, our orders were taken. It took about 10-15 mins to receive our food. Service was great! They were really busy but always checked on us.The food is great here! I especially like the battered fish tacos and the churros! The salsa, guacamole and chips are also a must.Enough about the food. The drinks are what makes this place a popular happy hour spot. The margaritas and sangria are delicious! One pitcher = 7 glasses.Would come back again!\", 'Food from regular menu is not bad and would recommend it over the happy hour menu, which is somewhat bland and uninspiring (many of the items taste as though they were cooked in advance, and were dry or mushy or just not packing a \"fresh\" taste)... Drinks were nothing special... The lower rating is also because the service was uneven and at times, just not present.', 'Happy hour was THE vibe - $8 sangria (ok not a steal but still well priced / a good size glass / ... strong), $3 chips and salsa, open on Monday, and very attentive service to the outdoor area. My friend and I got each sangria and split. House Sangria: more body (red wine based), citrusy, and less sweet - more of a classic! White Sangria: lighter, more passion fruit, and a tad more bitter but sweet - sangria with a twist!Great place to catch up with friends over a drink and enjoy the extra hour daylights savings now gives us back :))', \"Nice bar with inventive Mexican. Great Ceviche good ambiance, nice service...soundtrack 80's disco\", \"Came here with a friend for happy hour around 5pm on a Thursday and it was fairly empty so we were seated immediately. The inside was cozy and the waiters were super friendly. We started off with a round of appetizers (the cauliflower bites and roasted brussel sprouts) and drinks (I got a white sangria and my friend got a mango margarita). The appetizers were good but not outstanding, but I absolutely loved my drink - I've never seen passionfruit incorporated into a sangria but it worked incredibly well! I was still hungry so I got an order of the black bean tacos and they were amazing - definitely a bite I'll be coming back for. Santeria is definitely a new go to happy hour spot for me in the Castro/Duboce area! I'm excited to go back and try more of their menu.\", \"TLDR: Great margs, sunny patio, extensive menu.I've walked by Santeria dozens of times during my commutes through the Castro but never thought to stop in for a drink until a friend suggested it. I'm so glad he did!Though I have yet to try their food (unless you count guac, which was pretty good), every version of their classic margarita I've ordered has hit the spot. Traditional, prickly pear, guava, mango, and even the cucumber-basil were delicious!  I haven't seen their patio being heated (very well could've been heated at another time of day without my knowledge) but on a sunny day with little wind, you can't pick a better spot to sit outside and enjoy a refreshing beverage.\", 'Food is not badWe sat at the bar for happy hour and the bartender is very nice I love the decor', 'What is there not to love about this place. Waiter was awesome and attentive. The ambiance is aesthetically pleasing with good music in the background. Such a vibe. But most importantly the food and drinks were amazing!!', 'Came here on a Thursday for a date night. Unfortunately they don\\'t take same day reservations so we went the walk in route. While it looked as if there was plenty of seating, we were only offered seating at the bar if we wanted to sit inside (outside was a little too cold for us).Sat at the bar and the staff was helpful and attentive. My wife enjoyed her cocktail as much as they enjoyed making a show of serving it. All of the food was very good. The papas bravas were creamy and spicy; the esquite (corn) sweet & charred; the carne asada plate was as expected; but the bbq nachos were the surprise hit of the night. Would highly recommend them. The churros we\\'re also a hit with us: crunchy and seasoned on the outside, but still doughy and chewy on the middle. They have taco Tuesday specials, which looked like they were worth checking out. Very pleasant experience overall, but missing the little \"wow\" factor on a couple of the dishes.', \"My vegan friend was visiting SF and he wanted to stroll the Castro, so I looked into bars and restaurants in the area and picked Santeria since they have a few vegan options on the food menu and it looked like a cool spot. We arrived shortly after they opened on a Sunday afternoon and got a table right by the window which was perfect for people watching and we had a full view of the bar which is big and I thought we'll decorated. We had a few different folks take care of us during our visit and enjoyed a few drinks and shared appetizers. I loved the Girl de Polanca and while I liked the papas bravas, we LOVED the chicharrones and ordered a few plates of the. The vibe is very fun and upbeat, the staff was all super friendly and happy to help with menu recommendations, and I can't wait to return.\", '4/23/23 Charming murals, a bit of a drive for me from where I live in SF, and a friendly manager who shared his recommendations. I enjoyed my festive margarita that had cinnamon on the rims. The loaded nachos (which come with fresh guac) are filling.', \"Came here for happy hour - apps and margs. For food ordered the cauliflower, patatas bravas, chips and salsa. For drinks ordered two margs, cucumber-basil & prickly pear. Food wise the chips and salsa were the real standout with the most flavor and portion size. The cauliflower sauce was a little bland but still hit the spot. The potatoes aren't exactly what I expected from other patatas bravas but it was still good. Definitely spicy and covered in hot sauce so don't get unless you can take the heat! Service staff is super friendly!! The ambiance of the place is also dope. The big tv by the bar was showing off dragon ball z and the World Cup. So it was giving variety and something for everyone.\", \"I gotta give Santeria another 5 stars based off my Cinco De Mayo experience. The staff were on POINT for one of their busiest days I'm sure outside of PRIDE. Was there a 45 mins - one hour wait? Yes. Was it worth it? YES! While other Mexican restaurants are playing checkers on Cinco, Santeria is playing chess. They had a specialized Cinco menu that had a great selection of tacos, drinks, and sides with amazing prices for the city. I ordered 4 tacos (tehehe) and all were delivered prompt, hot and above all yes, delicious! We were in and out in about one hour but never were rushed since the staff was able to get the flow of customers under control.The basil margarita is to die for and my friends really enjoyed their guava and mango margs. Also the chips that come with the salsa are some of the best. All in all, treat yourself and go to Santeria for your next Cinco or whenever!\", \"We came here for Happy Hour! We were seated immediately and sat outside because the weather was quite nice. The ambiance was very nice and chatty outside. Our server was very responsive, and the food came out within minutes after ordering - so fast!! The dishes we ordered from the HH menu:Strawberry margarita - 10/10. Very good!Guava margarita - 8/10. Didn't really taste like guava, seemed a bit artificial. Chipotle Chicken Quesadilla - 10/10. This dish was so good and so filling. I asked for guacamole and sour cream on the side!Mexican wings - 6/10. The wings weren't anything special but they were filling.Flautas - 7/10. Pretty good! Papas Bravas - 3/10. We thought this dish would be fried, and not drenched in the sauce. It was quite spicy.Brussel sprouts - 10/10! This dish was so good, and the homemade mexican chili blend with the lime made this dish taste amazingChips & trio salsa - 9/10. The salsa were all good, not too much of a difference between them. They have a very big amount of chips for it all to cost only $3. We also asked for more salsa and they happily obliged! :)\", \"Came here for happy hour with my coworkers and ordered everything on their menu. Top highlights were the Mexican wings, Brussel sprouts, fish taco, guac and chips, chips and salsa, chicken quesadilla, whole wheat vegan chicharrones. The drinks were good and strong. Ordered 4 pitchers of margarita and they can do them spicy too. We ordered so much food the comp'd us the yummy churros at the end of dinner. Definitely looking forward to coming back here to try their other food. The owner was nice and kind too.\", \"The food here was delicious! Came here for brunch after a workout session at around 2 pm on a Sunday and there was no wait for a table. Some of the highlights for me were the empanadas & the octopus plate. The empanadas were fresh, buttery and delicious! I personally didn't like the sauce it came with but ate it with the salsa they brought for the chips and dip. The Mahi ceviche and the huevos rancheros was good too but didn't quite stand out. I would say you could pass and try something else! For the lamb quesadilla, if you like lamb definitely go for it. But if you're not a fan of lamb and find it gamey, then this isn't for you. Our waiter was sweet and attentive despite the busy brunch time which I appreciated. To end our meal, we got the churros which is a MUST HAVE. Literally one of the best house made churros I ever had and I'm not being dramatic! The outside was crispy and sugary while the inside wasn't overly fried and slightly doughy/fluffy. It came with a sauce that wasn't too sweet either. You have to try it. Next time I'll be back to try their AYCE/AYCD brunch menu!\", \"Such a cool place! Drinks are delicious, food was good and the service is wonderful. I would absolutely come back here if I find myself in SF. They're also near a thrift store so that's convenient to do some light buzzed shopping lol\", 'Fresh off the plane having just landed at SFO, we were hungry and ready to eat. Thanks to Yelp, I had found Santeria beforehand and knew that we would be ok to dine in without a reservation on a Thursday night. We came in just after happy hour ended at 6:00 PM and were sat immediately at a bar table, and there were still lots of tables available. I picked Santeria because of their attention to gluten-free items (labeled on the menu) and unique menu items. We started with some drinks, the santería and the zicatela. Both very good. I also got a prickly pear chia lemonade which was nice and refreshing. Appetizers: chips and salsa. Chips were fresh and salsas tasty with good heat. Guacamole was not bad, could have used some salt. Papas bravas were spicy and flavorful, delicious. Dinner: quesa tacos were a hit. The kitchen was very nice to add shrimp to the tacos de hongos y nopal and the chicken tacos were both thoroughly enjoyed. You could tell the tortillas were homemade. The lamb birria was very tender and the consommé was pretty good as well, again I felt like it needed a little more salt. Overall we very much enjoyed our experience here, service was fast and friendly and the vibes were on point.', \"Santeria is such beautiful Mexican Restaurant in the Castro! I've passed it so many times and I can't believe I haven't been here yet. They have both an outdoor heated dining area and an indoor one. And one indoors is decorated with some of the most beautiful murals in the area. We came here for dinner, and everything was so good! From the hot chicken flautist to the juicy carnitas wrapped in banana leaves. The cocktails were amazing too. We even got a mezcal flight (they're pretty strong, so be careful! Haha). We had to end with dessert, so we got the tres leche and it was incredible! This is such a cute spot in the Castro. Props to our server, Jerry, and the manager, Alvaro, for giving us amazing recommendations on food and drinks!!\", 'I came here for happy hour and got 2 margs with my friend and the salsa and chips and guacamole and chicharrones. The margaritas were light and fresh. They have a lot flavors - we got the guava and prickly pear and enjoyed. The chicharrones are actually vegan, but my friend and I felt they tasted very similarly to the non vegan version.', \"The outdoor parklets are super cute and there are a bunch of tables out front. Lots of drinks and eats on the HH menu (M-F 3-6pm) for only $8. There's margaritas of many flavors, frose, and sangria. Drinks were stiff, service was great, and we had a great time. Of the HH food items, we enjoyed the tacos and churros the most. Don't sleep on this happy hour!\", 'Food always great. Service can be hit or miss. Seems like they are getting their team into a flow', \"Thank you Santeria for offering an amazing happy hour. I was able to kick off the weekend with my Yelp besties, Eric R. and Kyra K., by enjoying delicious food and refreshing cocktails. Thanks for a great time, y'all!-- FLAUTASAn order came with 2 perfectly crispy, crunchy flautas with chicken tinga inside. They were topped with vibrant and fresh shredded romaine, and pickled onions. I really liked the pureed avocado sauce on the bottom as it paired well with the cotija. I found myself scraping the plate to clean every bit of it up. The chicken could've used a bit more flavor though. I didn't realize it was chicken tinga until I looked back on the menu. -- CHURROSGet at least one order of this for the table! These fluffy babies were dusted in a nice layer of cinnamon sugar, which were already so good on it's own, but that dulce de leche dipping sauce? It took it from so good to so great.We also got a couple of rounds of drinks which included the frosé and multiple flavors of the margarita. My personal favorite was the frosé, but you can't go wrong with any of their drinks; all of them were a hit for us.So for anyone looking for a chill HH spot, Santeria is it!\", \"The happiest happy hour I've been to! I'm so glad I got to dine at Santeria with some newfound friends, indulge in their happy hour offerings, and satisfy my Mexican food cravings. Their happy hour runs on the weekdays from 3:00-6:00 p.m. and they take reservations! My Yelp friend Eric R. brought up the idea of meeting up at Santeria. Although we didn't have reservations, we were seated as walk-ins outside where they have plenty of tables and heat lamps. Since we came during happy hour, we ordered off their happy hour menu which has various small bites that are big enough to be a meal! What caught my eye were the Carnitas Tacos--which are my favorite type of tacos. The Carnitas Tacos came with two tasty and filling tacos. The tortilla was homemade, the meat was tender, and the mild salsa and lime on the side paired well. My friends ordered the Flautas and Carnitas Tacos and we shared the Churros. We all loved the Churros which I highly recommend--crispy, fresh, and fluffy. I couldn't get enough of the dulce de leche dipping sauce that came with it. The parklet was casual, chill, and the perfect place for us to talk and catch up. The service was great and I didn't feel rushed at all. Our food and drinks came out fast, our waters were refilled, and everyone working was friendly and took good care of us! Parking is street only and an easy walk from public transportation. Santeria's happy hour hit all of my marks. The food was delicious, the workers were respectful, and the environment was welcoming. If I lived closer it would be dangerous. Muchos gracias to my Yelp friends Eric R. and Jennifer L. for such a fantastic meal and memorable night!\", '\"I prefer love over sex.\" - EnriqueHola! My experience at Santeria is based on Happy Hour in a very, very happy neighborhood:D Located in the Castro district is where I met up with Kyra & Jennifer (foodie and IRL friends) for some Mexican food! Quiero ser tu heroe! Let me be your hero...Rainbow flags flying everywhere, after all, it is Pride month and we\\'re in the center of lovely unicorns, so of course we start off with colorful Margaritas. I had the Prickly Pear which was a fuchsia color, yet oddly I expected a drab light green (not sure why lol), and this bright drink really hit my happy spot! One of the lovely ladies had the Frosé and she enjoyed it! We also ordered some bites on the Happy Hour menu, including Churros (highly recommended), Quesa Tacos, Flautas. Our second round of drinks were all Margaritas, Mango on the rocks, Mango frozen, Guava on the rocks. For me, I preferred the Prickly Pear over the Guava. I didn\\'t get the chance on the Mango Margarita, but both of my foodie partners agreed it was delicious. My only regret was not ordering more food during the Happy Hour, hey we were chatting so much :D, but at least we got in that second round of Margaritas jaja! Salud! In the end, do believe all the reviews you\\'re reading about Santeria! The staff pleasant, professional, chill vibe and in the good part of America. The food delicious, but the drinks were the star of the show! And of course how can I not have a most positive experience w/ some of the loveliest people on earth!', 'Came for a birthday happy hour. Our waiter (mustache and pierced ears) was a sweetheart and very attentive. We had: fried cauliflower, patatas bravas, chips and salsa, mushroom taco, pork taco, and churros. This place really knows their way around a deep fryer. Seriously cannot go wrong with any crispy. Tacos were a little small but a reasonable deal for the neighborhood with taco Tuesday.', \"Worst Mexican food I've ever had. Period. Period. The chicken on the tacos was foul. I could not eat it, my boyfriend said he couldn't finish his because it started to hurt his stomach. Possible food poisoning, for real! The service was terrible, we were right next to the door and they did not check in with us or ask us why neither one of us ate our food (bc it tasted rotten!) PS- The only way you can get guacamole is if you get the large appetizer, you can't get it when ordering entrees, asked for some with taco entree and was denied. Wasn't too impressed with the salsa 3 ways, bland and hardly any flavor, but the tortilla chips were great! House made tortilla chips are delicious and the rice, the rice was made well, but literally everything else was Disgusting. I highly recommend never going here!\", \"We were out galavanting with great friends late last night, and they brought us here. It's AMAZING! The owners of Santeria are so warm and friendly.  It's like they are welcoming you back home from a long journey. My husband and I were not big fans of tequilas and mezcal, but after trying out the drinks here, we've had a change of heart. They take pride in their selection of agave, and the skilled bartenders are mixing up drinks that bring on some nice saltiness and heat (great with the food).I had the Santeria (blue agave tequila blanco, el rey zapoteco mezcal, velvet falernum, house-infused jalapeño cordial, citrus, layered bitters, black lava salt) Hubby had the Mexican Gringo with tamarind-chili infused tequila, mango cordial, lime. Perfecto!!We also shared a round of beautiful mezcal (I wish I took a pic of the bottle). We just had some late night apps that truly hit the spot  and are also vegetarian friendly!! Get the Patas Bravas, esquires, and chicharron y Guacamole (whole wheat vegan chicharrones were phenomenal...and I'm a Meat-n-Potatoes person!)Will I be back? You bet! And I'm bringing the Familia with me next time!\", \"I've been a few times to Santeria now and every experience has been a nice one. Today was no exception. There was no wait time for our late brunch. Lucky for us today was relatively less busy. We've been more often for dinner. The food was delicious and fresh. We have a few go to items. The cafe de olla is one. Today we also got the guacamole and vegan chicharone, the lamb birria and the pastor tacos. Everything was perfect. See pictures for evidence of deliciousness!\", 'Santeria ia a real gastronomic adventure with cahrming ambiance. The menu boast a variety of classic Mexican dishes with nice prices. The tacos were generously filled and offered an array of meat and fish options.Everything was great but we hit the peak hours and in result received our order with delay. Despite this, we had great and friendly dinner as saff behaved politely and nice.']\n",

      "Reviews: [\"This spot is up there for one of the best Thai spots in SF. It's also run by a family, and you can tell they really care about the quality of both the food and their service.Every dish we had was packed with flavor and consisted of delicious, high-quality ingredients. It was clear from every bite that the chefs put a lot of care and attention into the dishes served.One of the aunties told us that their cooking comes from a central region in Thailand, where the spice level lies somewhat in the middle of the North and South's. Personally, I found that the dishes we ordered did have a pleasant middle heat.We will 100% be coming back!\", \"Best new Thai restaurant in SF! I love love love Thai food and have been itching for a new spot since Farmhouse Thai is hard to get to from Marin. This new spot blew our group of five away - they took a day-of reservation no problem (we called in to get the larger group at the right time as opentable was limited), were flexible when we were running 15 mins late, and had lovely, attentive service. With a great spread for both vegetarians and meat lovers, Oraan felt authentic but still approachable. We shared three appetizers and a papaya salad, and each ordered an entree - we left pleasantly stuffed with leftovers. The Christmas decorations and overall ambiance were cozy and added to the vibe. Can't wait to come back soon!\", \"So glad we came here! My fiancé and I came on a Friday night. We got seated immediately. Service was great, the servers were tentative. We ordered the fried chicken, papaya salad, pad Thai and the sukho Thai noodle. Everything was delicious. The papaya salad was medium spicy and just gave the perfect kick. The fried chicken was fried to perfection. The key lime cream on top was delicious and paired perfectly with the fried chicken. Similarly with the fried kale. Entree: the paid Thai and the sukho was good too. Both tasted yummy however the pad Thai was a bit sweet. I did crave a bit more spiciness. The decor was nice on the inside. Gave Christmas and festive vibes. They have a great selection of food. So we can't wait to come back!\", \"Last minute dinner spot that I thought was delicious and worth visiting again for a special occasion (you can find cheaper Thai food in the city). I appreciated the unique items on the menu. I chose an appetizer as my main meal and was happy I did. The gai manow was a fried chicken topped with a citrus sauce. I've never had anything like it and I'm glad I gave it a shot. I'd go back just for this. Ginger rice was a great side to go with the dish.\", 'Upon recommendations, we made dinner reservations for last Friday night at Orran. Parking right out front for convenience. We were greeted when we walked in and noticed many small tables in a cozy, intimate setting. I would say the service was the best! We were asked if we had questions about the menu, we were given instructions on what dip goes good with the food and definitely was checked up on several times throughout dinner. The menu had appetizers, soups, salads, entrees, noodles/rice and dessert. It had a lot of typical main Thai dishes you would normally recognize. I ordered the Hoi Jor which is the deep fried crab meet with pork and plum sauce. I also ordered the chicken Thai Fried Rice. The chicken in the fried rice had a hard texture, not my favorite. Lastly, we shared the Gal Himmaparn which is crispy fried chicken with cashews, bell peppers, basil and onions. All dishes arrived together and quick quickly actually! I was hoping the appetizer would come out first so we can enjoy a bite first before the entrees. Either way, it was the quickest cooking ever! Good Thai style food, authentic, fresh and good flavors. A good spot for dinner if you are craving thai flavors.', \"The place was nicely-decorated and each table had a candle. The staff were very welcoming and helpful with ordering since we couldn't decide what to get. Many of the dishes were new to us and not the typical dishes at most Thai restaurants. We ordered: - Gal Manow: wow the outside layer was super crunchy and the chicken was moist. The sauce was tart and creamy, with a slight sour aftertaste. Even if you don't like sour foods, I would def recommend trying this dish bc the flavors are well-balanced and you barely taste the sourness. The fried Chinese broccoli was similar to seaweed and a great crunchy addition to the dish.- Sukho Thai Noodle: I mostly got this one bc of the variety of meats and toppings with the noodles. The pork belly kept its crunchiness, even though it was a bit wet from the soup. The noodles were cooked well, not overcooked. The soup was a bit sour and spicy, very delicious. Wish it came with a bit more noodles though. Overall, this place is delicious and the friendly staff made the experience even better! I will come back to try other traditional Thai dishes and would def recommend this place!\", \"I'm blown away with how delicious this Thai spot is. The parking around this area may be troublesome but it is well worth the trip. Servers greeted my boyfriend and I right away and we got promptly seated.The noodle soup (5/5) the noodles were perfectly cooked and the broth was umami and packed with flavor. The different variations of pork offered each bite a new texture and flavor which made this dish even more enjoyable.Tom Kha (5/5) Sweet, sour and creamy. Can't go wrong with this soup.Thai ice tea with coconut milk (4/5) The thai tea itself was delicious but I would probably not get it with the coconut milk next time. The concoction was foreign to me and didn't fit my palate.Not only is the food good, the portion size is humongous. I can't wait to come back to try the other dishes they have to offer.\", 'My new local Thai Restaurant! The KAPOW MOO KROB is delicious!   And generous portion of the Coconut Ice Cream', \"You need to try this place! I am almost compelled to say this is my FAVORITE Thai restaurant in the city. The prices are very reasonable for San Francisco. The dishes are unique, high quality, and large. The service has a hint of the welcoming and sweet hospitality you get in Thailand. All around a solid new Thai restaurant in San Francisco that I think the city desperately needs. In terms of dishes, everything we order was out of this world. The Gai Manow was so crispy and the tart lemon cream sauce paired well with the crispy greens. I have never heard of a dish like this before, but it is definitely a must try when you come to this restaurant. The Sukho Thai Noodle was PACKED with various meats and the crispy pork was SO CRISPY. I would come back to this restaurant just for that! The Nuer Marakot and Laab were solid dishes as well. Not as stand out as the first two but the Nuer Marakot is a great dish if you are looking for a solid beef dish and the Laab Gai is a great starter with great fresh ingredients. As I said before, service was great! Servers were super friendly, super attentive about filling our water, and made the experience so great. Since the restaurant is fairly new, it was very easy to get a reservation at 7pm on a Wednesday evening -- hopefully things get packed and busy for them soon. You can easily make a reservation on OpenTable. Ambiance was super laid back as well. The restaurant is decorated very nicely (think BoHo Thai modern) and have a bright welcoming reception environment. It's a great place for a first date or a nice dinner with friends. I had heard from a server they were able to accommodate a party of 20 a couple days ago. Mark my words, YOU NEED TO TRY THIS PLACE!!!! You won't regret it.\", 'One of the best Thai experience I\\'ve had! Because it\\'s not only the food, but the whole experience with this new restaurant is what all Thai restaurants should aspire to be. Ambiance, aesthetic, presentation were all top notch.This is a top class operation.The menu is quite comprehensive and diverse. From the young papaya salad to fruit salad to deep fried battered chicken served with lemon cream sauce (Gai Manow) to crudités of raw vegetables served with coconut dipping sauce (Lon Kung).This evening I\\'ve had a delicious Thai style longan juice beverage which was refreshing with fresh longan fruits, mint leaves and hint of brown sugar. I also had the \"Som tum pon la mai\" fruit salad, it was vibrant, sweet, sour, fresh, nutty, crunchy, fish sauce, explosion of flavor, you will love this!For my main course I\\'ve had \"Nuer Marakot\" which is marinated beef with Thai eggplants. Wow! Fatty, meaty, bold, complex, the Thai eggplants are cooked but still crunchy and the bamboo shoots are such great compliment to this dish. You like Thai green curry? You WILL LOVE this dish!I really wanted to try their mango and sticky rice dessert, but I was so full.Maybe next week or maybe tomorrow, I like this place so that is for sure.Aesthetically pleasing to the eyes from the ambience, utensils down to the food presentation.Service was great, the staff actually approach and attempt to have a conversation with you / the customers, unlike many other typically Thai restaurants staff who are either too shy or not really talking to their customers.I would recommend this restaurant highly to my colleagues (even to my Thai friends at work) and my hotel clients.This place is one of the restaurant where I would happily spend my money at.', \"New Thai restaurant. Food and service is very good. Well, the pad tai is a bit too sweet for me. The rest of the items are very good but very strong flavor. You cannot eat the food on its own. You will need to eat it with white rice. My favorite is the appetizer fried crispy chicken with sauce on top and their A La carte  fried crispy shrimp with tamarin is really good. The shrimp is so crispy that you literally can eat the whole shell too. Which we did. Overall we all enjoyed our meal. One last note, it's not cheap but good to try once in a while.\", 'Welcome new addition to the Thai food scene in the Inner Richmond. So many new and unusual dishes to choose from. Of the three dishes we ordered, only tom ka gai soup was familiar. The soup was loaded with white meat chicken, fabulous mushrooms, and a rich coconut broth--too much for the two of to finish. Another tasty dish was a deconstructed salad with a shrimp and pepper spread that could be smeared on lettuce and cabbage leaves and adorned with carrots and cucumbers. The final dish was pork four ways: pork shoulder, roast pork, ground pork, and grilled pork belly in a somewhat spicy brown sauce over rice vermicelli noodles. If you are looking for a unique Thai experience, give Oraan a try.', 'I love Thai food and always up for checking out new places. I finally tried Oraan Thai after passing by so many times. The authentic Thai food here was absolutely delicious and beautifully presented using Thai ingredient herbs for decorations. The service was the warmest hospitality. This place such a chill spot , nice and relaxing to catch up with friends, the ambience is great not too loud like any others.I enjoyed Kung Makam ( the crunchy prawns with tamarind sauce) and Hormokbaitong ( steam mixed seafood in red curry sauce.Menu choices very interesting and unique. I would highly recommend this restaurant.', \"We came here after a great Thai massage 5 blocks away. We are keeping the theme Thai today!And Oraan Thai did not disappoint. We started with the Curry Puffs for appetizers as recommended by the wait staff. The crust is perfect in texture with a very slight sweetness to it. The filling was tasty and plentiful. The curry sauce to dip it in complemented the crust and filling perfectly.The Spicy Pork Ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender and very delicious! They provide you plastic gloves for the ribs. I wasn't sure if it was because it would be fiery like Korean chicken or because it was messy. Turns out it's messy but still medium spicy. The Vegetable Curry was yummy, the sauce delectable. I had the Butterfly Pea Strawberry Lemonade and hubby had the Thai coffee.The service was excellent. The employees are very attentive, friendly, helpful. They are great at topping off your water glass which is great as some dishes are spicy. The ambiance is perfect for a date or family oriented. It is spacious and clean, very nicely decorated. This restaurant was formerly Mescolanza.  We enjoyed our experience here quite a lot, the food is very good. We will definitely return.\", \"23.09.23.

We couldn't stop thinking about those dishes when we left. This is a neighborhood gem for sure.\", 'The food is very delicious. It has a clean atmosphere and the employees are very friendly. I believe this was an Italian restaurant before. First of all, the food tastes good, so I recommend it.I ate the food recommended by the server and it was a very good choice.', \"The best fruit salad I've ever had. If you want to wake up, please try this one. I ate it with fried eggplants, which are also popular here.\", \"New, bright Thai spot on Geary near Arguello with excellent service and fresh, delicious food.  The smoked salmon/avappetizer was the perfect start to a wonderful lunch of crispy pork belly and pad see shrimp.  Don't miss the sticky rice and mango\", \"Beautiful interior, calming music, and friendly staff.Enjoyed everything we ordered:1. Curry puffs - Abundantly filled. Flaky on the outside, soft on the inside. Paired with a mild peanut sauce and a refreshing cucumber relish. The cucumber relish was not too sweet or sour.2. Nuer Marakot - Never had this dish before, and learned  that green curry has more of a kick. The beef was tender and flavorful. Eggplant and other vegetables in the dish were delicious. I appreciated the portion of this dish.3. Sukho Thai Noodle - Loved all the flavor this soup noodle had to offer. It's sweet, sour, and just opens up your appetite. The roast pork was very crunchy. But my favorite part is the soup. I would love just a bowl of noodles and this soup haha.\", 'Wonderful food, amazing service and beautiful decor. Oraan looks like a hole in the wall from the outside. But inside it is modern and simply beautiful. We ordered all appetizers and they were massive portions and delish! Our favorite by far was the Gai Manow (Crispy battered chicken, smothered in a creamy citrus sauce) I would describe it like a fluffy chicken nugget with the perfect cream sauce.Staff was kind and attentive. I will absolutely be coming back here.', \"My partner and I dined here last evening, what a pleasant experience in service and flavors!The servers were attentive without hovering.We started with the fruit salad and were amazed by the complexity of flavor coupled with sweet and spicy finishes. I had the Pad See Eew (I've been looking for a replacement ever since Derm changed hands) I was not disappointed! absolutely spot on and a large portion. My Partner had the Pad Thai, says it's the best he's ever had and again a large portion. We'll be back and we're bringing guests!\", \"Oraan is better than great, it's chic, to begin with--the silverware is golden!-- and had the perfect table for my lunch today, with a view across Geary to Dumpling Baby and, across Third Ave., to Toyota... i took one look at the menu and decided i would just start with two appetizers and work my way down on my next visits. delicious. exquisite.i would want to save this place for myself, but it seems big enough (two rooms) to handle the crowds it will surely draw.\", 'Wonderful meal at these brand new restaurant in the city.

      "Reviews: [\"Snagged a spot here over the weekend with a friend visiting from out of town. The restaurant is quite beautiful. We sat at the counter, which provides a nice view of the open kitchen.Right from the get-go the staff impressed me with their service, they kindly handed us each a glass of complimentary champagne to toast my friend's engagement when they learned we were celebrating. We went with the chef's menu ($75), and it was pure deliciousness. Every course got better and better. Seriously, don't sleep on it. The lamb, scallops, and tres leches were my personal winners! Also, props to them for being cool with swapping out a course due to my friend's allergy. If you're into cocktails, go for the Lemon Kalimera. So GOOD! This is one of the best restaurants I've been to this year. I will be back!\", \"Visited here with 3 friends, had been curious about the restaurant for a long time. My favorites: -California Tahdig -very novel with uni on top-lamb-Kibbe-Kayseri mantı -Muhammara - hard to come across decent muhammara with so many different recipes all over Middle East. This one had my favorite flavors, not sweet, not too hot, still good amount of spiciness. We tried cocktails Efendi & Anatolian Martini, both contained good amount of alcohol. Presidio is great as location. Service was quite fast, I'm impressed. I'd love to hear more music to suppress the noise.I'm on a mission to the desserts next.\", \"This was all over the place - some really strong highs and some uncomfortable lows. Starting with best - the beverage program and service here is really strong and reason enough to come back. A unique and well curated selection of cocktails, NA drinks, southern and eastern Mediterranean true old world (not French) wines (we need more of these in SF!), and after dinner drinks (including a few awesome ones made in house).The food was full of highs and lows. Great flavors across the board, but a couple execution misses that hurt. We ordered the '12hr' lamb shoulder - what came out was an underbraised inedible piece of lamb filled with unrenderd fat and connective tissue and tough chewy meat - more like '2hr' lamb shoulder. I'm surprised the chef ever let this leave the kitchen. This speaks to a culture of profits over quality and raises some long term concerns of how long that can last in the customer discerning eyes... $70 down the drain. The service was full of highs and lows too. The beverage directors and most waiters were warm, friendly, and engaging. At the end of the night halfway though dessert, a waiter we hadn't seen all night came by and dropped the check unprompted. Caught off guard (we'd only been dining 1hr), we asked if we need to leave? He gave gruff and walked off. Our true waiter was apologetic but this left an uncomfortable lasting feeling in a meal that was full of highs and lows. Im sure they are looking for a Michelin rating at some point - but the restaurant appears to have too many covers to properly execute the menu consistently and the service has a few bad apples in a sea of stars. It's also really really loud in there.\", \"Really great meal, ordered the octopus, bread and dips, kebbe, lamb chops, mushroom pasta, and a bottle of Turkish wineGreat attentive service and lively ambiance, ceilings aren't too high and can get quite loud and livelyDelicious food, and great wine recommendationsDefinitely returning in near future\", 'Wow- beautiful restaurant in the presidio, amazing food, super friendly staff, cool ambiance.  Their menu changes frequently based on season - but rest assured the chef knows what they\\'re doing. The octopus carpaccio shined for us. Super thin slices topped with a delicious \"salsa\". The pastas were perfectly Al dente, desserts light but fulfilling. The chicken was a bit dry but overall theogony enjoyed the creative take on Mediterranean food. The place is huge- multiple rooms to cater to private parties, large main room where the bar is. Bit expensive but cest la vie in this city. Will definitely return!', \"We went to Turkey earlier this year and absolutely fell in love with the food! So when we learned about Dalida we had to try it -- and it did not disappoint!  We sat at the chef's table and had a great time watching the kitchen prepare all of the dishes. I was completely captivated with the bread station.  I loved seeing them roll the dough and watching the bread puff up as it baked in the open oven. In terms of food, be sure to order the octopus (Sujuk) and the freshly baked bread.  We were also impressed by the lamb, which was super tender and had flavors reminiscent of the holidays. I wasn't a fan of the stuffed mussels because it seemed odd to serve rice cold. The cocktails were fun and really beautiful, but they were on the small and the light side.\", \"If you're able to score a reservation, you're already a winner!  This is one of the hottest places to get into right now in SF and now I too can see why.  It is quite far in Presido but the setting is beautiful, quaint, and calming. As for the food, everything was delicious. You must get the Breaking Bread, aka pita (1) and spreads. It might not sound like much but the pita is THE best pita I have ever had! It is soft and warm. The Kibbe was delicious as well but know that it is just one and think of it as a small appetizer. The octopus was tasty, came thinly sliced like carpaccio. It's not your standard octopus you normally would have but it's worth trying. The surprise was the lamb manti in the pasta section. While they are tiny little pockets filled with lamb, it was very delicious and filling. You won't want to miss out on the dessert either! Service was good and the food was served very quickly after we ordered. The space is spacious so you won't feel like you're sharing a table with those next to you, which is a luxury at most places.With that, I wish you all the luck in getting a table....before I do again :P\", 'Dalida is a welcome dining option in the Presidio, serving upscale Mediterranean food in a beautiful setting. Husband-and-wife chef owners Laura and Sayat Ozyilmaz combine their extensive fine dining experience with Sayat\\'s Turkish roots for a modern and heartfelt menu.We opted for Chef\\'s menu, which was a curated experience of their a la carte items. They started us off with the breaking bread - a plate of wonderfully fluffy \"chubby\" pita accompanied by a spread which included hummus, muhammara, and smoked yogurt. Don\\'t miss this one.Another equally as vibrant and delicious starter was the octopus and sujuk. Extra-thinly sliced octopus was harmonious with bright, tangy olive-caper dressing and spicy fermented sausage.The eye-catching, seafood-topped California tahdig was not as memorable as its appearance unfortunately. I thought the seafood mixed oddly with the tahdig rice. I recommend the traditional saffron tahdig instead, with extra crispy rice and barberries.There is a concise Middle Eastern pasta section, including classic Turkish kayseri manti, which are meat-filled dumplings topped with yogurt and tomato sauce. I wish I tried this here, since I loved it in Turkey, but we had a pescatarian restriction. Instead we had su borek, a pan-roasted philo dough pastry with spinach and comte sauce, which unfortunately was a bit bland. I found this to be the case with the swordfish as well.The sides were strong, including forest mushroom tabbouleh lettuce wraps with great texture from crispy fava and pomegranate seeds. I was excited to see late season sweet jimmy nardello peppers still on the menu as well!I was glad I saved space for dessert. Their melon and anise ice cream was a pairing I didn\\'t know I needed in my life. And the rose tres leches cake was both airy and decadent, and a nice nod to Chef Laura\\'s Mexican roots as well.We had a couple rounds of cocktails with dinner, and I liked the Pasha, a well-balanced blend of tequila, strawberry, tomato grenadine, thyme mountain tea, and clarified milk.Overall, I would recommend Dalida for the food and setting. I found the appetizers and sides to be standout, and next time I definitely want to try some of their meat dishes like the aleppo half-chicken or 12-hour lamb shoulder tandoor.', 'TL;DR everything about Dalida is VERY instagrammable, BUT unfortunately the food falls short and does not live up to it\\'s hype. Tucked away in the picturesque Presidio, Dalida\\'s interior exudes a contemporary Californian charm. We made reservations for a party of 5 and were seated in the beautiful inside dining room. The presentation of each dish and cocktail was visually captivating, a food photographer\\'s dream, but the cuisine didn\\'t match the hype. While the cocktails were great, I wouldn\\'t expect any less at the steep price point. the food was lackluster and the flavors were bland. Here\\'s the rundown:- Octopus & Sukuk (2/5) - EXQUISITE presentation, thinly sliced octopus adorned the plate. Too bad it lacked flavor, especially at its $26 price tag - Half Dozen Oysters (2/5) - While the oysters were fresh, it was hard to ignore the presence of shell fragments and intact muscle. For an upscale establishment charging almost $5 for ONE oyster, this was disappointing. - California Tahdig (2/5) - Again, STUNNING presentation on a bed of golden saffron rice adorned with uni, trout roe, halibut, and caviar. Despite all the premium ingredients, their flavors together achieved no synergy. FYI - this thing was $44 a pop yet definitely NOT suitable for \"family style\"  - Breaking Bread (4/5) - As someone with pretty high standards for the carbs i put into my body, I thought this dish was the star of the show. Two generous pieces of freshly baked pita bread encircling a captivating medley of hummus, muhammara, smoked yogurt (the best!), and various pickles/olives. The harmonious flavors was delightful - seamlessly blending the the nutty richness of the hummus, tangy allure of the smoked yogurt, savory notes of the olives, all wrapped in the warm embrace of the oven fresh pita. - Fattoush Salad (3/5) - Another beautiful dish with all the colors of the rainbow. I enjoyed this salad with the sweetness of the heirloom tomatoes, stone fruit, balanced out by the cucumber, fennel and feta. But it lacked anything distinctive and tbh I could have made this at home - Crispy lamb ribs (3/5) - This one was less \"pretty\" compared to the others, with a few small pieces of lamb with bone intact served on a plate. The taste was okay and it was indeed crispy, but failed to stand out. - Kayseri Manti (1/5) - I had very high expectations for the lamb dumplings and tomato sauce, but the disappointment continued. These manti came out surprisingly dry, devoid of any lamb or meat flavor. To make things worse, a mysterious film coated the manti which made it appear reheated ... potentially by a microwave- Cauliflour (3/5) - Charred at the top but again nothing special.- Desserts - we ordered several, but I didn\\'t eat any, so it would be unfair to rate. However based on my friends\\' commentary the pistachio baklava was the best oneService won\\'t receive a markdown for what I assume to be an one-off experience. Our initial server was helpful at first, but became insistent on upselling, even after we declined mulitple times. Once he finally got the hint that we are not interersted in additional entrees, he completely ignored us for the rest of the night, even when we tried to order more cocktails and desserts he was nowhere to be found. But thankfully, another attentive staff member came to our aid, taking our orders and offering assistance.Overall, considering the price (~$130 per person), the distance to travel here, and bread being the standout course, I would not contemplate a return visit. I would also not recommend this place to anyone except for food photographers/influencers', 'I visited Dalida Mediterranean restaurant two weeks ago, and it was an exceptional experience. The Kayseri manti I ordered were a burst of flavor, with a delightful meatiness and a tangy tomato sauce that added the perfect balance. The \"breaking bread\" dips and bread sampler were a testament to the restaurant\\'s celebration of tradition; every dip was a delight, but the smoked yogurt dip stole the show.I also tried the Shepard\\'s pipes cocktail, which, although stronger than expected, still impressed with its taste. The restaurant\\'s ambiance was inviting, creating a wonderful atmosphere, and the attentive and courteous wait staff added to the overall charm of the evening. It was a memorable dining experience that I would highly recommend.', \"4.5 starsA gem of a restaurant in the Presidio so you should get there early for the breathtaking views on a little walk before you dine. The restaurant interior is stunning and our waitperson had been the artist who did the murals.The tasting menu was very reasonably priced and it was all delicious and beautifully plated. It's hard to say what was more delicious. There was a great variety of colors, textures and flavors to feast the eyes and mouth.If there was a let down, it was the non traditional baklava. If they had called it something else we would have been delighted, but it wasn't baklava.While the staff was friendly and personable, we felt rushed. The pre dinner drinks came out long after the apps. The dishes kept coming and at times the table was packed with dishes.I want to go back and order from their regular menu.\", 'Food is excellent. Everything tastes delicious and amazing. Decor is cute. Comfortable chairs and tables. Nice bar. Service is only okay; may need a few extra servers and hostesses.Overall, solid 4 stars.', 'Amazing place in the beautiful Presidio park. Go for the atmosphere which is warm, inviting and festive as well as the outstanding food. We got the tasting menu which allows you to try almost all the best options on the menu. We had an amazing family dinner and chef sayat came to check on us and take a fun picture for my collection of me posing with amazing chefs!', 'Lovely setting and a lovely space. Sadly. our very chatty server flipped between taking our order, making recommendations, talking us out of dishes, making more recommendations, and not writing anything down...resulting in a good number of errors with our order. Food was gorgeous and pretty good but very, very pricey. It might be good to try here again after some of the service kinks get worked out.', \"The puffy bread with dips was hands down the best thing I have eaten this year.  Unbelievably DELICIOUS.  Perfection.  Seriously, PERFECTION.  We ordered two salads, and they were incredible.  My mushroom pasta was simply awful, dry dry dry.  Utterly inedible.  Undercooked and dry dry dry.  I'm surprised the kitchen would send that to a table, at a restaurant like this.  Bad, REALLY BAD.  And nobody asked why I only one bite of it when the plates were cleared.  Having said that, the service and puffy bread were SO GOOD that I will give five stars.  (I'm surprised that a restaurant like this has no idea how to make and serve pasta.  My mushroom pasta was completely inedible, and nobody noticed or cared that I didn't eat it.)\", \"Checked this place out and luckily made a reservation. It was pretty busy upon arriving. Inside is beautiful and open. There is also a side room for smaller private events. Servers were friendly and checked on us thru the night. We decided to do the chefs menu. There wasn't an actual menu to go off of and they stated it could be different dishes between tables at the same night if ordering the chefs menu. We tried some cocktails and wine and all were really balanced, beautiful, and tasted great. The food was all really delicious. We had pita and dips, fattoush salad, and mussels to start. Then we moved on to crispy ribs, pork shoulder, seasonal vegetables, and saffron tahdig rice. Dessert was a variety of 3 dishes and all were great. Every dish was flavorful, great texture, and so delicious. Pita was soft and fluffy, dips were delicious and nice to have different textures, the salad was bright and refreshing, and pork was fall off the bone tender. The rice had a nice crisp to the outside and color and everything went well together. Dessert was refreshing and loved that it wasn't too heavy or rich at the end. I'd definitely come back and recommend.\", \"Hands Down!!! From entrance to last second - totally epic service ! Every each of employees is so polite, so helpful, so detail oriented! I literally have seriously never been in a place where every employee puts  of their efforts and perfect manners by heart. Food is so authentic, and wine list is perfect ! It is not a loud restaurant, and chairs are so comfortable, restrooms are clean, it is right at perfect spot to find parking. I wish there was a chance to give more than 5 stars. I sincerely haven't been in a place in harmony. Especially appetizers are off this world ! You will not disappointed, and you will leave this place happier than you walked in.\", \"Zero bad things to say about Dalida and the prices are so good! If you don't have any crazy allergies and you're fairly adventurous with your food get the CHEF'S MENU. They curate a lovely dining experience for you with different types of flavors and colorful dishes. There will be an appetizer, main, and dessert rounds. The portions are pretty large. With the amount of food I had, $75 was such a steal. ENJOY! PS: My friend and I couldn't get a reservation, but if you're there right when they open the bar seating is left for walk-ins.\", \"What can I say---Chef Laura and Sayat are a phenomenal team. I've been a fan of theirs since their Istanbul Modern pop-up days and I'm so so glad they have this fantastic restaurant that has been years in the making. My husband and I had to do the chef's menu, of course. It started with the Breaking Bread plate that came with the fluffiest fresh hot pita that could only be described as pornographic as you tear it open and the hot steam pours out. My partner was properly obsessed with the smoked yogurt. The twist on dolmas surprised us both as they were encased in a mussel shell. I'm not a huge fan of dolma and my husband detests mussels, but this interpretation brought us together in harmony. Everything paired so nicely with a light red Armenian wine.The feast continued with lamb ribs, beef kebabs...by the time we got to the lamb shank we were so full (didn't help my husband ordered extra pita). The team gave us a respite before dessert, which was much needed. I honestly don't know exactly what we had, one was a rich chocolatey-coffee mouse and the other was a tart cherry Turkish style ice cream---the two dishes balanced each other so well. I was alternating bites between each dish. For $75 pp, it's definitely worth it. Can't wait to go again soon with more friends to try more plates. Bravo to everyone at Dalida, we're already big fans.\", 'Highly recommend this place! Have eaten dinner both inside and outside. The Chefs Tasting Menu allows you to try a bunch of different dishes on the menu (and sometimes off menu items). Service is really solid and the restaurant has a beautiful setting in the Presidio. The Chubby Pita is a must!!', 'I would leave 10 star for the food and 2 star for the service, except for the sommelier who did a great jobPlace is tucked away in the presidio and it was packed on a Sunday night!Beautiful restaurant We started out with confit artichokes and celery root in a citrusy dressing with feta cheeseWe had the breaking bread with hummus But the best thing was the Aleppo chicken, best chicken I had ever had in my life and we ordered a portion of saffron riceSo good,', \"This place has been a delight and such a great addition to restaurants in the north side of SF. I've been here a couple of times already. The first time, I came here for a date night on Thursday from Marin and was able to sit at the counter in front of all the hustle and bustle of the kitchen without a reservation when they opened. The second time I had a reservation and also got a counter spot. The food is amazing. I had the best pita bread ever here. And all their dishes are sooo good. Cocktails are also very creative. Will be back soon!\", 'The Presidio is an unexpected setting for a trendy, chef-driven restaurant, so it may come as a surprise that this is home to the new Dalida, opened by the same husband-and-wife chefs who ran Istanbul Modern and Noosh. To start, \"Breaking Bread\" was a platter of dips and pickles including hummus, muhammara, smoked yogurt, olives, and pickled cucumbers, onion, and eggplant, all served with a super fluffy, freshly-baked round of \"chubby pita\" bread on the side, dressed with za\\'atar and olive oil. The fluffy bread was perfect for eating with the different dips, and we ordered plenty more helpings of the hot bread over the course of the meal. The two most artistic dishes we tried were the Octopus and Sujuk (thinly sliced octopus topped with an olive-caper dressing and a pork sujuk sauce) and the California Tahdig, a crispy round of saffron rice topped with Santa Barbara uni, smoked trout roe, raw SF Bay halibut, and seaweed. The octopus packed a real flavor punch and went nicely with the lavash crackers on the side, while the California Tahdig screamed pure luxury seafood!One of the most unique dishes was the Su Borek, made of sheets of pan-roasted yufka pastry layered with cheese, all served in a creamy spinach sauce. I especially liked the crispy ends of pasta paired with the creamy cheese and the earthy spinach sauce. The Iberico Pork Souvlaki was made of chunks of super tender, meaty Iberico pork collar grilled on a skewer and served with crispy shoestring potatoes, onions, and mustard sauce on the side. Finally, we had the 12-Hour Lamb Shoulder Tandoor, a centerpiece dish made of a huge boneless cut of lamb shoulder served over a hawaij-spiced keshkek (wheat stew), braised chickpeas, and purslane. The lamb shoulder was meaty and fork tender and had an outer layer that was crispy and nicely seasoned. On the side, we ordered the Roasted Cauliflower covered with harissa, which was served in a cast iron pan and had a nice spicy kick. Overall, the setting and service here were top-notch, but the real highlight was the food, which was as artistic as it was delicious!', \"One of the best restaurants I've been to in 2023 located in the beautiful Persidio. This place has a beautiful open kitchen set up with all chef bussing themselves in and out for the highest quality food. I'm by no means a pro to the Turkish Mediterranean food but this place surprised all of us in such an unexpected way.The portions were meant to be shared. We had ordered the California Tahig, which is with some sashimi + uni and fish roe. Very fresh, but probably not the greatest one to share. The breaking bread and the 3 sauces that came with us was absolutely amazing. We ended up having to order another piece of pita for $5. The thing sliced octopus is a must. And think the Su Borek pasta was an interesting choice. The noodles were slightly pan-roasted so not your traditional pasta. The server was very attentive and it was overall a really pleasant dining experience! Ask for recommendation on the cocktails!\", \"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night! We booked a last minute reservation for 8:45 PM and sat at the bar. The restaurant was fairly busy and a lot of customers were enjoying their meals. We got the California Tahdig which had fresh fish and unique. It came served on the saffron crispy rice. This was good but is a smaller dish an appetizer. We also tried the artichoke salad with celery root. I would skip this one next time. I would try the breaking bread instead. We also tried the crsipy lamb ribs which came with a delicious yogurt sauce. For the mains we tried two of the pastas the manti and the one with spinach cream. Both were good! The manti had a hint of spice which was balanced with the yogurt. I've had manti before but these dumplings were super tiny which were cute! The spinach cream pasta was cheesey and mild almost like mac and cheese with a yummy sauce. This place has so many yummy bites to try and we were able to watch them prepare the food which was a fun experience. The also have a nice wine menu and cocktail menu. I tried the lemon gin cocktail l. I would probably pick something else next time maybe just go for the wine.\", \"I've been to Dalida two times now and have been really impressed each time. It's a beautiful restaurant at an incredible location in the Presidio. I feel like the standouts on the menu are definitely the octopus, breaking bread (get extra pita) and the deserts, but it's hard to go wrong with anything. The California tadigh is pretty but would skip, I felt it was actually quite bland, and expensive for what it was.\", \"Mostly really good food in a nice location with professional service.It's worth the trip there just for the Breaking Bread app. The entire dish is amazing, the chubby pita slathered with smoked yogurt over the top delicious. Pork skewer was good, not great. Anatolian Erishte was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had, harmonizing lots of great flavors that were very well balanced. Corn Masa in Grape Leaves couldn't compete with the other dishes. Charging $22 for a skimpy glass of wine that is easily found at retail for $33 a bottle left a bad taste in my mouth. Buyer beware.\", 'Visited here last night and it exceeded all of our expectations!! The menu offers many family-style dishes which left our party of 5 full and satisfied. The steak was delicious and cooked to perfection. We also loved the octopus dish - it was fresh and very tasty!! There are a ton of unique cocktails on the menu that we enjoyed trying. To end, definitely try the chocolate pudding and the tres leches cake. Our service was quick and our server offered wonderful options for our mains and dessert. The inside is bright and lively - the outside patio would be an amazing place to sit to view the presidio fields on a warm evening. Will definitely be coming back!', 'Our party of three finally managed a dinner reservation on the Friday after Thanksgiving after having tried to get a reservation for months. Maybe my anticipation tinted the evening but our experience fell short. It is a beautiful space and I love the flavors, however, service did fall short. 1) Starting with cocktails - they took forever to arrive at the table and we were continuously asked to order food before we received the cocktails. They were delightfully made cocktails but we were real thirsty by the time we received them.2) When we received our cocktails and were ready to order our food, our server tried to upsell us but then told us we probably ordered too much food, which was confusing. 3) The breaking bread dish was great but when we ordered, our server told us it comes with one pita and asked if we wanted to order an additional pita. This is a pet peeve of mine - the amount of bread that comes with the dish should be enough for the amount of dips being served. If it\\'s not enough, are we supposed to eat the dips with a spoon? 4) The pork cheek was phenomenal. Would absolutely order again and again.5) The lamb dumplings were also delicious.6) When the server introduced the entrees, she mentioned they serve the lamb shoulder with a spoon since it\\'s so tender. It was not and we needed to use a knife to cut and distribute.7) Minor note and maybe it was just us and the \"too much food\" we ordered but our table was too small for family style dining. I do hope to visit again, now that I know what to expect and what to avoid.', \"Maybe it was an off night or I ordered the wrong items.Sat at the bar, waiter barely acknowledged my requests. Ordered the stuffed mussels and the mushroom pasta. Was surprisingly underwhelming. Pasta was too stiff and barely any mushrooms (sauce was decent though).Mussels were just ok, like it's something I could have made at my home.Ambiance, however, was great. And right next to Golden Gate Bridge so not a bad place to hang out after.\", 'Visited 7/8/2023. Party of four with reservations at 7:30pm. Most important thing to note when you map to Dalida using their physical address ... It\\'s located in the Presidio and not the Financial District; be sure to add \"The Presidio\" to the address. Also, I highly recommend parking at the 93 Moraga Ave Parking lot which is about a 3 minute walk to the restaurant and parking is free after 6:00pm. This restaurant opened on June 30th and what an amazing location they selected in San Francisco! The staff is friendly, courteous and so very attentive! We went for the Chef\\'s Menu ... No clue what would be coming out so put our trust on the husband-wife chefs and we were not disappointed! We left fully satiated and our palates wonderfully challenged. And there is something to not having to think about what to order especially when you love surprises and have no clue what to order.Check out the pictures! Mouth-watering adventure for sure! Enjoy! Since 10 pictures are the max, I am unable to share the additional two desserts that was part of the Chef\\'s Menu .. We also enjoyed the pistachio tart with Vishne sour Cherry ice cream and the Presidio rose tres leches cake with Dalida\\'s rose marmalade.For our first visit, we made the right decision to let the chef curate our experience! I swear we tasted a good third of the menu. For $75 per person, our palates were extremely pleased with each choice prepared by the chef.Note: The Chef\\'s Menu requires full table participation so grab your daring friends and go!', \"Everything was absolutely superb!! This is my second time coming to Dalida and this time was even better than the 1st time. Breaking bread is such an exquisite experience with the most perfect soft pita ever made, the octopus, and all the other dishes were stunning as well. For dessert both the baklava and the tres leches cake were incomparable, if I'd have to go with one I'd choose the tres leches, but please try both. 100% recommend! I can't wait to go back.\", \"4.5 stars. One of the newest restaurants in the Presidio. Parking was easy and service was good. Food was delish and presentation was so pretty! -Got the half dozen oysters-fresh-Midye Dolma-which is stuffed mussels with rice. Never had anything like it and flavors were good, but didn't love that it's an cold app. Threw me off a little bit and wondered if it was warm would it taste even better. Still worth trying.-California Tahdig-Crispy saffron rice, Santa Barbara uni, smoked troutroe, San Francisco Bay halibut, preserved yuzu. This was so pretty and the crispy rice gives the dish a nice texture. Wish it was a touch crisper-Breaking Bread-Hummus, muhammara, smoked yogurt,pickles, marinated olives, chubby pita. This was so fluffy and delish. People that complained it was too little, it was plenty and you can order another one for $5. -Octopus and Sujuk-Thinly sliced octopus, olive-caper dressing,pork sujuk sauce-this was a gorgeous dish. It comes with crackers and this is a must also! Never seen anything like it.-Fattoush Salad-heirloom tomatoes, stonefruit, pita, crutons, pomegranate molasses-needed something refreshing with all the heavy dishes we ordered.-NY Strip Steak-Ezme sauce, char-broiled eggplant puree, jus-This was cut for us already and cooked perfectly. The finishing salt was the perfect amount, but didn't like the purees. Can do without. -Harissa Cauliflower-huge pieces of cauliflower, but too much harissa making it too spicy-Shoestring fries-can't go wrong with any type of fries and had really good umami seaoning-Got 2 desserts to end the night.\", \"my new favorite mediterranean restaurant in san francisco, and in the beautiful presidio of all places. the ingredients are so fresh, there is something for everyone (pork, lamb, chicken, veggies, pastas), and the chef brings a very unique blend of flavors to lots of the dishes. it's not your traditional mediterranean spot!! the service is great and the cocktails are very interesting too!!\", \"I recently dined at Dalida and while the food was good, I couldn't help but notice the lack of a personal touch in the service. The absence of candles on the dessert was disappointing, as it could have added to the overall dining experience. Furthermore, the decision to send out all the dishes at once felt rushed and detracted from the enjoyment of the meal. I hope the restaurant can work on improving these aspects to create a more memorable dining experience.\", \"What an experience! This restaurant is one of the best restaurants I have tried in San Francisco. I don't know how to emphasize how amazing everything was with words. But, I will give it a try. Location is fantastic. Restaurant is located in beautiful Presidio. Lots of parking available. This is very rare in the city. Restaurant itself is large, feels warm and is decorated very well. It has 2 seating areas as well as an outdoor area. Service was one of the best we have had in a long time. Everyone who works here is extremely polite, nice and welcoming. Just great. They go above and beyond to make you feel comfortable and well taken care of. We were a group of 6 and one of us had some dietary restrictions. They made sure that all of these restrictions are taken care of and accommodated my friend. We got the tasting menu and had lots and lots of dishes that I lost count. We got many appetizers, many main courses and 4 deserts. They brought us a number of complimentary dishes as well. We were beyond full by the end. Every single dish was absolutely delicious. The chef himself came to our table and we had a great conversation with him. He mentioned that most of the chefs were his students from when he was a teacher at a culinary school in Napa. Long story short this restaurant is a gem in San Francisco. We will go back here many more times and recommend this place to everyone. I cannot put all the pictures here due to Yelp limitations. But, here are some samples.\", 'This might be the new hit in town. Beautiful location, nice decor, amazing modern Turkish food. Great bar inside too.', \"Had a really great night eating dinner at the bar with the bartenders. I have always enjoyed having dinner at the bar as an alternative to sitting at a table, there's always someone there to help and you can really engage. The food was incredibly good. We had the bread plate, seafood platter, mushroom pasta and the whole turbot..... waaaaay too much food but that was our fault we just wanted to try everything. The cocktails were made with my favorite ingredient, pride. Spectacular. We had such a good time we forgot to take pics (a good sign). The only pic I took was on the way in, this beautiful plant that greeted us at the stairs.\", \"Solid Solid for a new restaurant the service,food and ambiance hit all the marks, tucked away in the Presidio this quiet area is in need of a good dining options to capture the views. I hope they will have a opportunity to open some outdoor dining in the future, the octopus & California tahdig we're so yummy but save room for desserts  you will thank me later\", 'Love the appetizers. The chubby and octopus sujuk were standouts for me. The rest of the food is tasty and overall a nice dining experience inside the Presidio.']\n",

Serving staff seemed overwhelmed and never stopped by to refill water or check on us after we got our food but the food...', \"Truly delicious every time, can't go wrong with anything on the menu!!! I always enjoy the green beans and any assortment of their dumplings\", \"The baos here just hit different. Like everyone has pointed out below, the place is popular so wait times can be a bit long. Luckily when we came for lunch on Saturday the Yelp waitlist wasn't too bad (20-25ish minute wait). We ended up ordering pork xiao long baos, juicy pork baos and kung pao chicken dumplings.My favorite was the pork xiao long bao- they're much larger and juicier than what you'd get at a typical dim sum place. The pork baos (生煎包) were also delicious. Fried things are just tooo tasty, and the crispy wrapper paired super well with the meat and soup inside. The kung pao chicken dumplings weren't my favorite, but they are definitely an interesting take on traditional steamed dumplings.Def one of the best places in the bay for dumplings and baos!\", \"Nice baos. The Numb and Spicy Xiao Long Bao was my favorite item here.The pan-fried juicy pork baos, normal dumplings, and XLBs were well made, but I dont exactly understand why the waitlist is more than 1 hour, or why it has a Michelin star.The service was definitely better than normal Chinese restaurants, and the plating and dishes were unique. I really appreciate the effort they put into the restaurant as a whole.It's definitely worth a try, but I'm not sure if I'd be willing to wait more than 1 hour to eat dumplings more than twice a year. I'm happy this means business is good though!  If you're looking for something to do nearby, we finished a yogurt from Souvla while waiting.\", 'Juicy pork bao - Pretty tasty. Balanced-ish flavor. Decent friedness on the bottom, atad thicker than necessary.Pork dumpling with seasame and chili oil - Weak flavor profiles :(Numb spicy XLB - They were ok.Okra with garlic - Decently made.Not bad food. Very pricey.', \"I LOVE this spot. I highly recommend trying to come here right when it opens, because it gets PACKED. The longest I've ever had to wait for a table is probably 40 minutes? You add yourself to the yelp waitlist at the tablet at the door. I've tried a few dishes, and I liked them so much, I don't really feel the need to try much else... though I should.Dry cooked green beans: amazing. If you're a hater of veggies, this dish should be enough to make you reconsider. The pork chive dumplings are pretty solid, but aren't my most favorite item. I highly recommend the pork xlb and the juicy chicken bao. The juicy chicken bao is extremely juicy, so be careful when biting into it. My friend took a bite and it squirted onto my napkin. I thought it was great LOLI personally get full pretty quickly when I eat here. Definitely start off with smaller dishes and feel free to order more, as necessary. Wait staff is really on top of it. They'll take your order quickly, and kitchen is also very quick at turning food around!\", \"Dumpling Home is one of my favorite dumpling spots in the city! It's definitely the best one around the south part of SF. The best phrase to describe it would be: good, but overpriced. Then again, most of SF is overpriced. As it has Bib Gourmand (in the Michelin guide), Dumpling Home pretty much always busy. You'll have to get in early and stand outside on yelp waitlist for 10-60+ minutes, so plan accordingly.The ambiance and service are pretty standard. Food wise, my favorites are the green beans, fried pork bao, boiled pork dumplings, and pork XLB.Overall, I'd recommend coming here with friends or on a date. It's got a nice vibe for all situations. I've came here many times and it hasn't let me down yet. Would recommend!\", \"This place lives up to the hype! I LOVED it and will be coming back. All the flavors were absolutely delicious, food came out sooo quickly. It was a super laid back environment and I highly suggest going for lunch as it's not as busy. Ordered the juicy pork bao, ginger noodles and WOW! 10/10\", \"How have I not written a review for my favorite dumpling spot in the Bay Area??? Long overdue because now I am a 10 minute walk from this gem! If I could give Dumpling Home a 10/5 on Yelp I would. They have the JUICEST XLB's (and panfried xlb) that leave you with a mouthful of soup. WARNING: They are piping hot so have your spoon ready to catch all the soup with each bite. My go to order: Numb and spicy pork XLB and woodear mushrooms. The amount of times I have had this meal since moving to the city is ridiculous. It truly is deliciously comforting. Service is as quick as they can be, especially because the lines at Dumpling Home are no joke! Both outdoor and indoor seating available with casual ambiance. (Takeout is just as good no matter how cold your XLBs get)If you can name another dumpling spot that squirts soup, has thin yet chewy dough, and has so much pork filling... LET ME KNOW because Dumpling Home has it all.\", 'Normally a mob scene, it\\'s manageable on Monday just before noon.  Service is quick, though a bit inattentive once you get your initial order of food. Food is delish and I totally understand why they\\'re trying to turn tables fast.Pan Fried Juicy Pork Bao: These are the best of both worlds.  The flavorful warm \"soup\" filling, but with a half-crispy half-soft wrapper.  It\\'s essentially like a xiao long bao and potsticker hybrid.  Must be really popular here, because mine came out quickly.  The dumpling sized spoon is especially nice for carefully biting off the top and sucking out the juice, since it catches any missed juice.  Very hearty, like all 6 baos is almost a meal for someone that orders another dish.Numb & Spicy Pork Xiao Long Bao: I love xiao long bao and I love Szechuan food, so this was a perfect mashup for me.  The XLB was excellently crafted with skin not too thick to be too chewy, but also not too thin to fall apart easily.  Nice tender pork meatball inside and lots of soup.  And this time the soup tasted more soupy than fatty, since it had some spicy sauce inside.  Really great.Ginger & Green Onion Noodles: Very simple, yet very delicious.  The crispy fried green onions gave a nice smoky taste.  Meanwhile, the ample amounts of soy sauce and oil made the noodles nice and slick.  Plus the noodles were chewy and fresh.  A good way to round out the dumplings with a little extra carbs.Dry Fried Chicken Wings: Wasn\\'t a huge fan.  The skin was crispy, but I it felt like that was mainly because of a lot of batter.  Still visible fat underneath, unlike with Korean Twice-Fried Wings where the under fat renders off.  And the glaze was very sticky & sweet.  I don\\'t mind a little sweet on my wings, but this seemed too sweet without equally strong opposing flavors to balance it out.  Guess the lesson learned is to stick with the dumplings and noodles.', 'No Fees', \"Food 9/10Definitely get the 生煎包 aka pan-fried dumplings. The pork ones are the OG, and they literally tasted exactly like home. I really missed Shanghai after this meal, but the meal itself was super heartwarming and made me super full. Definitely ask for chili oil to pair with them. We also got the pork and crab soup dumplings, but I think those could be skipped. The flavor of the soup inside them just wasn't even close to the pan-fried ones, so that left me a bit disappointed. The green beans are fine and a good way to balance the copious amounts of dumplings we were inhaling.Atmosphere 8/10A normal Chinese restaurant I guessService 8/10Very sad we arrived and waited around an hour before our time on the waitlist came to be. But it was worth the wait. I don't mind. Service is solid, but we were starving at that point, so whenever we saw a plate of dumplings go by and swerve to another table, we got sad.\", \"Dumpling Home is one of my top spots in SF, and *the* top spot for dumplings! Strap in for long wait times though and no reservations. But if you time it just right, it'll all be worth it. The soup dumplings are the star, doesn't matter which protein too much but the pork ones are always the best. I've tried the chicken, the pork, and the spicy pork-- all great!My second fave dish is the dry fried string beans, as is at most Chinese places. Dumpling Home's are equally amazing. I get some every time, last time we liked them so much we ordered them twice.The chicken and mushroom dumplings and the pan-fried pork baos are delicious as well! The baos are super hot though, similar to the soup dumplings, so beware!They have seating inside and outside, but will always have a line, longer the later you go I believe. Join the yelp waitlist and walk around Hayes!\", \"I can eat 4000 of these pork juicy baos in one sitting easily. Came here around 5:00 on a Sunday evening and waited 30 minutes for a table! I liked how they have spacious outdoor seating with heat lamps so it's not too cold! I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu however the Xiao Long Baos and pan fried pork juicy  baos are a must! Try both ( steamed vs pan fried) to see which one you enjoy more! We also tried the Dan Dan noodles which were super refreshing and stuffed with minced pork!\", \"Never been to a dumpling place. Dumpling Home made that a reality as a friend of mine lives nearby, perfect to stroll by. There was a bit of a wait, around 15 minutes and we were seated inside. There's also an option to sit outside. The place seems basic and straightforward. Everything is very fast pace. The menu is separated by style and almost every order has the ingredients listed. I went for boiled, pan fried, and steamed dumpling. A variety of chili oil, steamed ones had that yummy but hot broth inside. Be very careful, dumplings can explode inside your mouth while hot. If not hot they burst into a splash of flavour in your mouth. Green beans were good; needed more flavour. The noodles with sesame paste were really yummy; nutty and full of flavour. Perfect consistency of noodles. Wings were really yummy; they had more sweetness than spice but that comfort vibe is there. Water is provided and filled often. I felt satisfied. Really savoury. I recommend it. They have a nice selection of teas.\", \"Dumpling Home is such a classic! I love taking anyone here - SF locals or visitors - whenever there's a craving for Asian food & dumplings. There's always a line - for good reason -  so try to get there before lunch/dinner rushes! If you do face a rush, no worries - you're in such a cute lil area of Hayes Valley to explore.I've been here multiple times now & the Juicy Pork Baos ALWAYS hit so hard. Make sure you order enough so you can get multiple of these baos cause they're so soupy and full of flavor (and hot! so don't burn your tongue!).The rest of their dishes are also yummy! I enjoy their Pork Xiao Long Bao (though not the BEST I've ever had. I also prefer the original flavor over the spicy), their Boiled Dumplings, and the Ginger Green Onion noodles (dry).\", \"me and my friend went here today for a sunday evening dinner. i've always walked by this place and seen a long line of people there. it's always popping day or night. we get there around 6:30pm, and put our name on the yelp waitlist, and end up 12th in line. since it's in hayes valley, i'd highly recommend walking around while you wait to be called up! it took us ~25 minutes to get seated (outside, with cozy heaters!). we ordered a couple items (that we definitely had to take home as leftovers): shrimp loofah xlb, garlic cucumbers, vegetable boiled dumplings, vegetable steamed dumplings, chicken bao, shrimp and woodear dumplings. the garlic cucumbers were a bit underwhelming, but the rest of the food was great. my friend loved the chicken bao for its juiciness and crispiness. i loved the vegetable steamed dumplings for its ample fillings and size. we both enjoyed the shrimp and woodear dumplings for its flavor and softness. the shrimp xlb was good, but i personally felt like it had too much loofah. overall, i'd def come here again and try even more of their items, but be ready to wait. the price here is a bit higher, but the quality of food can mostly make that up. the service was also extremely prompt and polite. a waitress gave my friend new chopsticks after they dropped theirs without even having us call her over which was so nice and convenient! a perfect place for dinner with friends or family!\", \"This is the place we bring people to when they come to visit SF. A popular spots dumpling home is worth the 30 to 60 minute wait for a table. The atmosphere is always bustling from open to close but don't be deterred, they move quickly.Whenever I find myself a dumpling home, I frequently get the same assortment of things. 1.) The fried chicken: recently tried this one and found it crunchy, juicy and literally mouth watering 2.) Garlic green beans: perfectly fried with amazing garlic flavor, if you go with a sizeable group, definitely get multiple orders so you don't fight over them 3.) Juicy pork bao: pan fried with a doughy bite, the filling inside is so savory. It's mind-blowing! I could eat an entire order just by myself. But be careful, they're super hot4.) The soup dumplings (of course): again they come out piping hot, but if you can wait long enough for them to cool a bit, you can enjoy a delicious bite of broth and meat (Or veggies!)You really can't go wrong with any of these. So maybe try some when you go.Personal Rating: 9/10 I am positive that you'll enjoy this place\", \"Wow! This place was worth the wait and the hype! We went on a Sunday and had to wait 40-50 minutes for a party of 3 people which wasn't too bad since there were other shops around to explore. It was near the end of closing time and people were still adding their name to the wait list. We were seated outside and after ordering, the food didn't take long to come out. The highlights were the crab and pork xlb and of course the juicy pork bao. It was the best juicy pork bao that I've had and I can understand why it was included in the Michelin Guide!\", \"Best XLB I've ever had hands down. Everything was amazing. I will come back every time I come to SF. It's that good. I'd take this over DTF! Great ambiance for a Chinese restaurant lol!\", 'Waited almost an hour for Dumpling Home for a Saturday lunch and it was worth every minute!Seating is limited as this is a small establishment. Serving staff seemed overwhelmed and never stopped by to refill water or check on us after we got our food but the food itself came promptly.In my opinion the Juicy Pork Bao is the star of the show! Amazing flavor and exquisitely juicy (mind your clothes when you take a bite!)Pork XLB was satisfying and on par with other well known soup dumpling spots in the area. Expect to spend $25-35 pp at this establishment (not including drinks). Highly recommend going family style for maximum dumpling exposure!', 'No Fees', 'Yum! We visited with a group of 7 and waited about 45min on a Sunday morning (we just missed the first round of people to get seated).The food was a bit pricy but the xlb were delicious! The skin of the xlb were nice and thin, with piping hot broth inside.', \"The best pork xiao long bao and juicy pork bao I've ever had!  The lines were long so we actually just ordered the dumplings to go. Highly recommend these dumplings and can't wait to come back!\", \"I've been wanting to try Dumpling Home for yeaaarrrs but we were too lazy to make the drive out to SF. I finally got to eat there because it was Memorial Day weekend and my husband was willing to take me out to SF for the long weekend. We got to the restaurant 20 minutes before they even opened and there was a line already! We saw the line before we even found a parking spot (there's only metered street parking), so my husband dropped me off just to get in line. By the time they opened, the line reach halfway down the block. Yikes. The restaurant is pretty small indoors but they do offer outdoor seating with heated lamps. We ordered..JUICY PORK BAO (6) $13.95 -first item to come out and it was sooo juicy. The juiciest we ever had. The pork was soft and tender but a tad sweet. The bottoms were not oily but they weren't too crispy either. Would have loved them if they were crispier on the bottom! 4/5*NUMB & SPICY PORK XIAO LONG BAO (4) $9.95 -super juicy, the dumpling skin was nice and thin but still had a good bite to them. Definitely felt the numb and spicy. 4.5/5* CRAB AND PORK XIAO LONG BAO (4) $13.95 -the crab was sweet. It wasn't fishy like most places I've tried. The pork meat seemed softer since it was mixed in with the crab. We usually don't care for the crab and pork XLB's but this was good. Again, the dumpling skin was nice and thin. Juicy too! 4/5* BEEF XIAO LONG BAO (4) $10.95 -first time ever having beef XLB and it was good! I was a little worried that it would be dry but it was just as juicy as the other XLB's, very beefy in taste too. And again, the dumpling skin was nice and thin. 5/5* DEEP FRIED CHICKEN WINGS $15.95 -last item to come out. It came with 6 pieces, piping hot. The chicken wasn't dry, had a good crispy coating and sweet sticky glaze! 4.5/5* For the XLB's, I like how they let you pick 4 or 8 pieces so you have room to try other items. But it's actually cheaper to order 8 pieces compared to 4.. prices are still pretty dang steep though. Service was really good, they were around when we needed anything. One server even saw my husband struggle with picking up his XLB so she offered him a metal spoon. LOL I liked how when we were almost done eating, they made sure we got everything we ordered and asked if we wanted anything else instead of rushing us to pay and leave. AND THEY WERE BUSYYY. Overall I really enjoyed Dumpling Home and would totally come back again!\", \"I've been to dumpling home many times, and I think that the quality has declined throughout the two years since I've been here. However, I still think it's the best dumpling place I've had in SF.Food: 5/5I embarked on a dumpling adventure with a selection of their delectable offerings. The mala xiaolongbao, with its subtle spiciness, added a delightful twist to the traditional xiaolongbao. However, it's the classic pork xiaolongbao that truly stole the show with its savory perfection. While the crab roe and pork xiaolongbao was enjoyable, I found it to be a matter of personal preference whether it's worth the extra cost.Pork ear is always good, and Dumpling Home's didn't disappoint. The crunchiness and flavor left me craving for more.Now, the pan-fried dumplings were a bit of a mixed bag. When they're freshly made, they are an absolute delight, with a crispy bottom, a soft top, and a burst of savory broth inside. However, I did notice that sometimes they can sit out and become a bit soggy. It seems like Dumpling Home may batch prepare orders and serve them as they're ordered, which works perfectly for the xiaolongbao but not as well for the pan-fried dumplings. If you're fortunate enough to get a fresh batch, you're in for a treat. I tried both the pork and beef pan-fried dumplings, and they were both delicious, but the premium for the beef ones may not be necessary depending on your preference.Service: 4/5The service at Dumpling Home is commendable. However, there's one caveat -- be prepared for a considerable wait time. It's a testament to the restaurant's popularity, but patience is indeed a virtue here.Atmosphere: 4/5The ambiance at Dumpling Home is pleasant, but it may not be the ideal spot for a first date due to the casual setting. However, it can certainly work as a cozy date spot for those looking to enjoy a delicious meal in good company.In conclusion, Dumpling Home is a treasure trove of dumpling delights, from classic favorites to inventive creations. While the pan-fried dumplings might be hit or miss depending on freshness, the overall dining experience is exceptional. It's the perfect destination for dumpling enthusiasts.\", 'Food was absolutely delicious. I was introduced to the restaurant by a family member then I brought friends and husband here several times. They were all impressed with the food. The restaurant is low key, not super fancy but their food is legit. I would totally recommend it.', \"OH MY GOD. It was so good to finally have some great Chinese food (visited from SD). The wait was only about 30 minutes even though it seemed like it would be an hour or longer. Worth it.As you can see from my pics, we ordered a lot, just because everyone recommended so many things. The Numb and Spicy XLB and Pig Ear were my favorite things, just because they are my favorite things but honestly everything was delicious. You can't go wrong here. The Juicy Pork Bao was so good but I think I would've enjoyed it more if I didn't get 9 dishes, so that's a me problem.\", \"I absolutely love this place! I remember coming here when they first opened and the foods has always been super delicious and consistent everytime. The wait can be long, even on a weekday the restaurant was full. The xiao long baos have thin skin and tons of soup, one of the best xlbs I've ever had. Definitely try their dry fried chicken wings as well, so good!! The sauce that it's coated with is delicious and the wings are crispy as well. Great food and fast service!\", \"My friends and I have been wanting to try dumpling home for a while! The reviews are top tier and we have heard great things. When we walked in, the service was amazing and the restaurant had a very homey feel to it.Pork chili boiled dumpling - incredible dumpling, the sauce was very flavorful and the pork was very well cooked Chicken shiitake dumpling - a bit bland but was still really tasty nonetheless as the mushrooms were a great touchJuicy pork bao - I never expected a bao to be so flavorful! The outer coating was both crunchy and moist and the juicy inner layer is to die for. However, I will say the beef one was not up to par in terms of meat quality.XLB - honestly I was not too impressed with the XLB in comparison to other spots. The soup was a bit too tangy in the crab and spicy pork ones. They were also cold when served.This is a really great dumpling spot and I can see why it's so sought after!\", \"Definitely come early!!! Visiting from out of town and we came before opening being second group in line. Once they opened, they were quick to take orders and orders came out in a timely manner. They definitely do things in an assembly. There is quite a bit of seating, mostly 2 seaters but some for larger groups. Plenty of patio seatings too. After ordering, you can see they have a long line of people waitingThe shenjianbao was REALLY juicy. Dough for me was a little too thick for my personal liking but I loved the flavor. Crab and pork XLB... AMAZING!!! Perfect flavor, perfect thinness of the wrapper. Ask for soy and chili oil because they only give you a vinegar base sauce. The wings were good but I think more like a chili sauce wing, wet sauce. My least favorite but it's really good. Super juicy wings\", 'we came here on a tuesday around 5:30 pm. We were lucky enough to find street parking right next door and we got seated immediately. We sat in one of their outside booths but it\\'s covered and there\\'s heat lamps so we were nicely toasted.they were very attentive for the whole meal, coming back promptly to pick up empty plates. i like how they do sauces here - they give you a pre-mixed dipping sauce bowl with each new dish and honestly this is a lot easier than having to make my own dipping sauce.for the food:green onion noodles : 3/5 it\\'s not BAD but pretty mediocre compared to everything else here. doesn\\'t have a ton of flavor so i would skip thisnumbing XLB: 4/5 pretty good with a little bit of a kick. you honestly can\\'t taste the numbing spice that much.pork XLB: 3.5/5 basically the same as numbing just without the small hint of spice. it was good but nothing amazing. the XLB are super delicate and a few of them were already broken before we even tried to pick them up.pork and vegetable potstickers : 5/5 the \"skirt\" of crunchiness was perfect, and the inside of the potstickers was nice and juicy. tons of flavor and was fun to eat too.juicy pork bao: 5/5 the star of the show. this was so good, we got two orders and each finished 6 of them. the inside is hot but not scalding hot, and i love the crunch on the bottom of the bao. the juice inside was so flavorful, and the pork was also nicely seasoned and juicy. Each bite was so good, i would definitely come back here just for this.skip the noodles and just come for the juicy pork baos', 'No Fees', \"Solid dumplings here, a great option for dim sum in Hayes Valley. There's usually quite a long wait (30 - 60 min) and I personally wouldn't say it's worth it, but there's a lot to do in the area so you could easily spend the time walking around and, boom, it's time to eat. In terms of what we got, we ordered soup dumplings, the half-pan-fried dumplings, potstickers and beef tongue. We all had different favorites, mine being the soup dumplings, which is a good sign that there's something for everyone! And if you're adventurous and into different cuts of meat, the beef tongue is solid.Overall, would recommend but no need to feel incredible fomo when you see the line outside.\", 'Quick seating. Plenty of tables inside and outside. Service is quick with water and refills. Menu is simple to order. Most will order the signature dish of pan fried juicy pork bao. The steam xíao long bạo is juicy and tasty. Try to use the provided special spoon to enjoy the dumplings without jetting the juice to your neighbors We tried the beef tongues in the 1000 year old sauce. Served cold, interesting. Also ordered the house special noodles with sesame and peanut paste. We all think the peanut is too overwhelming taste but the homemade noodles are delicious. Service is quick and efficient. Price is ok. Outdoor seating recommended. Give it a try.', \"Came here from a friend recommendation and wow are the soup dumplings good. The pig ears and the noodles were good too (we personally preferred the dan dan noodles over the zha jiang noodles), but the soup dumplings were really the standout dishes. I recommend the pork soup dumplings and/or the juicy pork dumplings (the fried pork soup buns).Street parking is kind of annoying and expensive, recommend finding spots a little further away (for cheaper meters) and walking. There is the performing arts garage but it gets full - it was a Sunday around noon and the short term parking was already full. Expect a long wait at the restaurant as well - there's no online waitlist as far as I can tell. Just drop someone off to sign up for the waitlist while you find parking.\", 'I was beginning to lose faith in San Francisco food, until I tried here.There was a wait on a weekend night, but it wasn\\'t bad. You can simply add yourself to the Yelp waitlist in person.My previous dining experience where I couldn\\'t finish the food scarred me into not ordering as much here. So it\\'s so cool they offer 4pc dumplings for smaller parties!We started with the 4pc Beef Xiao Long Bao ($10.95), and I was feeling pretty impressed! Let\\'s turn our attention to their soup dumpling spoons! They made it so easy to just slurp the soup, and their soup was absolutely spectacular! Their dumpling skin was also my kind of thin as well!They had 4pc Numb & Spicy Pork Xiao Long Bao ($9.95) here, so why not? The name may be scary, but it wasn\\'t very spicy, coming from someone who can\\'t take spice. It was definitely an innovative different flavor for a soup dumpling, and I loved every bit of it!Lastly, the Juicy Pork Bao ($13.95) took a bit to come. I was getting antsy waiting, but when they came, they were so worth the wait! My bf tried it before me, otherwise I would have totally forgotten the \"Juicy\" in its name. Be careful of the hot juice squirting as soon as you take a bite! My favorite part was their pan fried tasting bottom. It was so fresh and fragrant! Their sauce was a little too sweet for me, but the bun tasted just fine on its own! Hands down my new favorite soup dumplings, and to think they\\'re known for their baos here. I highly recommend checking them out!', \"Ok these are literally the best dumplings I've ever had!!! The hype is real. They are loaded with juicyness and very flavorful. My faves are the Crab & Pork Xiao Long Bao and the Juicy Pork Bao. You also can't go wrong with the Numb & Spicy Pork Xiao Long Bao (it doesn't taste numbing and the spicy is just right). Also, the Pork Xiao Long Bao is good as well. Came here a little before 12pm and got super lucky and didn't have to wait to be seated(ended up sitting outdoors in their 2 seat table which wasn't bad at all). Super random that they have Thai ice tea at a dumpling spot, but I was really craving it and it was yummy as well. I would definitely come back here again! =)\", \"Good amount of outside-dining space. Although there was a wait list, my friend and I enjoyed the self-sign up for the waitlist they offered at the entrance. There were quite number of parties ahead of us but the waiting time went fairly quickly. Even with my observations, I noticed their table turn-around's were quick and immediately sat the next party. we ordered the fresh cucumber + garlic, numb and spicy xiao long bao, pork xiao long bao, Juicy pork bao, and spring rolls. The stars of this whole brunch-dining experience were definitely the chili oil and the red dumpling spoon. The chili oil was the perfect topping for the dumpling dishes. And my friend really enjoyed using her cute red spoon that she has not seen at other dim sum restaurants. It really helped elevate the dining experience. Overall the food was delicious and tasty, leaving me surprisingly full, although I did wanted to order more because of how good it was. Because of how busy it was the servers wernt as friendly but were respectful. They did an amazing job serving us overall.\", \"Best soup dumplings I've had in the bay area so farWas craving some soup dumplings and this place hit the spot. It is hot, ample sized, filled with soup and had mala flavor which I loved. You can actually see a ring of red from the outside but it is less spicy than it looks. Pairs well with their vinegar. They even provided a hybrid ladle/bowl which was perfect to catch the juicy. Be careful tho - the skin is super thin and delicate and I accidentally broke one of the dumplings during the transfer. The crispy soup bun was also excellent as well with a golden bottom crust. Tried the pig ear which had good bite and well marinatedPSA: this place gets pretty packed and there is a wait. We came 10 minutes before opening and was able to sit down in the first batch without waiting!\", \"Dumpling Home always has a wait, but for good reason! You can put your name down on the waitlist and then walk around the area.We were seated outside which wasn't too bad. There was a cute dog to the table next to us so we got a good view.There was 5 of us and we shared the following:1x Jellyfish salad with green onion dressing - I've had plenty of better jellyfish salads elsewhere.2x Pork xiao long bao - Perfect thiccness for the skin and had lots of soup. My friend even squirted the juices when she took a bite, so beware of hot delicious soup flying around the table!2x Pork dumpling with sesame sauce and chili oil - We originally ordered 1 and this was the first dish we got. We fell in love and ordered a 2nd dish. HIGHLY recommend since this was all of our fave dish!1x Juicy pork bao - Pan fried perfectly and lots of juice inside. This was for sure my 2nd favorite dish.1x House special sesame paste noodles - This was okay, but I've had better elsewhere.1x Ginger and green onion noodles - The noodles had lots of flavor. I feel like it would've tasted way better if it had protein in it.1x Dry cooked green beans - Can't go wrong with this. This helped balanced our entire meal.Dumpling Home is a MUST try. I'm still dreamin' about the pork dumplings with sesame sauce and chili oil... YUM.\", \"This place just checked every box for me! Our meal was exactly everything I was hoping it would be. We came with a group of six about 20-30min after opening on a Monday and still had to wait about 30 minutes to get seated outside. So this place is definitely very popular, so plan accordingly! Out group shared various dishes. My highlights were definitely the pan-fried juicy pork baos, fresh cucumber, crab and pork XLB, and fried pork wontons! The pan-fried bao's are one their popular items and I recommend giving them a try. We also tried both the wonton soup and hot & sour soup, but they weren't anything out of this world, but still hit the spot. Dumpling Home has easily become a spot I won't hesitate to come back too!\", \"Everyone and their mom has been raving about dumpling home and honestly I don't see the hype. We came here on a Thursday around 2 pm and we were seated immediately. Service was quick and efficient- straight to the point. We ordered 1 XLB pork, 1 XLB numbing, cucumber, and the juicy pork bao. The best thing was the XLB and everything else was mid. XLB pork- I have to say this is a contender for best XLB I've ever had. Super balanced and umami broth- a bit on the sweeter side as a heads up. The dough was a clean bite but still had a good chew to it. XLB numbing- not spicy at all and just tasted like the regular. Just get the regular and add chili oil if you want a kick. Cucumber- not cold enough to be refreshing and needed a good amount of chili oil to wake it up Juicy pork bao- I was the most hyped for this and was a bit disappointed. The filling was good but it needed to be more juicy and it was not crispy at all. The bottom was chewy almost like a Chinese donut and didn't have the crisp I desired. The XLB was the best part of the meal! My other beef with this place is how expensive it is. I love Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao in NYC which I can say they're both pretty comparable- esp bc both are acknowledged by the big dudes at Michelin. Nan Xiang is 6 for $9 and Dumpling Home is 4 for $10!!! Dumpling home is really good and I would come again just for their XLB. Not quite understanding the raving reviews on this place tho.\", 'No Fees']\n",

      "Reviews: ['Very nice restaurant. Good ambiance. I ordered the Chicken Ramen, Gyoza and Marufuku pork bites which was amazing. Service was excellent, very attentive and our waiter gave us good recommendations.', \"Marufuku Ramen stands out as an exceptional dining destination, offering a delightful experience for both lunch and dinner. From the moment you enter, the beautifully decorated ambiance sets a welcoming tone, creating an atmosphere conducive to enjoying a satisfying meal.The staff's service deserves a solid 5 stars, contributing significantly to the overall positive impression. Their attentiveness and friendliness add a personal touch to the dining experience, making patrons feel well taken care of.The real star of the show, however, is the ramen itself. Described as nothing short of excellent, the noodles are not just delicious but also crafted with precision. The silky smooth texture adds a layer of sophistication to the dish, making each bite a culinary delight. It's evident that there's a commitment to quality and authenticity in the preparation of this traditional Japanese staple.While the parking situation might pose a challenge, the fact that patrons are willing to take public transportation, like a bus into San Francisco, and then walk to the restaurant speaks volumes about the restaurant's reputation and the lengths people are willing to go to savor the culinary offerings at Marufuku Ramen.Marufuku Ramen appears to be a standout choice for those seeking not only an aesthetically pleasing dining environment but also an exquisite and authentic ramen experience.\", \"so creamy -I have to hit the 85 character count, so don't mind these extra words. Don't let it take away from the fact of the matter.\", \"Finally got to try this place after a few years!My friend and I put our names down on the waitlist and had Sophie's Crepes nearby while we waited.Despite having food prior, the ramen was still pretty amazing. Honestly, maybe ramen can only get so good, but this place is pretty up there. It had everything I could want in a ramen, which is: a flavorful broth, deliciously al dente thin noodles, and a perfect soft-boiled egg. Actually, I think my bowl did have a bit too much ginger at the bottom, but I just took that as a sign to not overeat.I ordered the Hakata Tonkatsu Ramen, but the Chicken Paitan my friend got was honestly much better and more unique! I don't see chicken ramen that often (or maybe I need to go out more), but that broth tastes so rich, flavorful, and healthy (in comparison). If/when I come back, I would get the Chicken Paitan, even though the Tonkatsu is the recommended one.I think the service here was pretty average, but the restaurant was nice and clean, so it was nice. This place is definitely worth trying at least once.\", \"Rah-Rah Ramen was really good here. We got seated immediately. It was 1:30 pm on Wednesday. If you want to avoid waiting, use Yelp and add yourself to the waitlist. Hakata Style Tonkatsu ramen was delicious. I loved the rich umami broth. The noodles are really good and the egg was perfection. I skipped the DX because I don't think the price with the added toppings was worth it. Space was clean but a bit cramped. The space utilization could have been better. The restrooms are ok but also tight.\", \"About the GF noodles: Yes, they exist and are delicious! They're also printed on the menu, so I believe they're always available. No, there is no GF broth available. So the GF noodles really only work for gluten-sensitive folks with minor reactions... and not Celiac. I ordered the tonkotsu ramen with GF noodles. I had only a slight reaction to the gluten in the broth, but it was worth it (and expected). Very tasty and I really appreciate the GF noodle option. Excellent service as usual.\", \"Some of the best maru-fukin ramen in town! At $20 the pork belly special is not cheap, but nothing in San Francisco is.I recommend the spicy it's not gonna clear your nostrils, but it's still flavorful. Get here early because you're going to wait about an hour on average which gives you time to shop around and wait for that text message to come through.\", 'It\\'s been a while since I\\'ve dined at Marufuku in Japantown. The last time I was here was post shortly after COVID restrictions were lifting and I did takeout (which wasn\\'t the same).I checked on Googlemaps before heading over, and it showed that it wasn\\'t as busy as it can be at around this time (1:30pm) perhaps also it\\'s pre Thanksgiving...so there\\'s that.Once I arrived, I used their new check in process to be added to the waiting list...user error though, there was one last step after you entered your details to click \"Join the waitlist\" which I didn\\'t do...ugh, then wondered why it was taking this long for me to be called.Needless to say, when I went to check and realized I wasn\\'t on the waiting list (aargh) I did it again, correctly and thankfully the wait wasn\\'t long at all.Despite the restaurant being very busy, the staff is fast, attentive and they get business done.I ordered a side of the chicken karage and the tonkotsu...medium spicy. Both were excellent, and were a throwback to the first time I\\'d ever tried this place.The only reason I haven\\'t been back more often is the fact that it is a slight drive to head over to Japantown...and the long wait is such a deterrent (can be over an hour in previous attempts I\\'ve had here).All in all, great experience...highly recommend!', \"My kid loves ramen and this place did not disappoint, they do offer a kids menu. This place is located in Japan town inside the mall which there's lots to explore in case you are waiting to be seated. Lots of paid street parking and challenging to park. Nice people and fast service. Place looks small but it's not lots of people can be seated! I had the Tonkotsu and it was delicious :) my child ordered from the kids menu and we will not do that next time, better off ordering regular size ramen. I do look forward to coming back.\", \"I may be one of the outliers regarding this esteemed ramen shop. This place has been on my list for quite some time and finally got to try them this past weekend. I like that there's a digital waitlist with texting capabilities to alert you when to come back to check-in. Everyone must be present before they seat you. My party of 3 arrived prime dinner time around 6pm and only waited about 20 minutes. Many staff came by wanting to take our order. Throughout the meal, many staff came by to clear the table, ask if you need anything. However, this was in a way that made me feel like hurrying you up so that I can leave faster and slightly pretentious. Mind you, I'm a slow eater and like to enjoy the meal. I understand that the faster they turn tables, the more people will get served. Thus, bigger profits. What about the customer experience?Anyway, our table ordered the tonkatsu ramen, the veggie ramen, and gyoza. The broth for the tonkatsu was pretty good, slightly creamy but not too much. The chasu pieces were really thin and tiny. The veggie ramen broth was too creamy, where it was thick. However, great that they didn't skimp on the veggies. The gyoza was a waste of money, no flavor/lackluster.I'm glad I tried this place and probably don't need to visit again any time soon. Definitely open to trying them again in the future.#40/2023\", 'No Fees', \"So I was expecting to have my taste buds blown but instead left with mixed feelings.Pros: I'll admit I did do takeout so I didn't get the full experience. I got the Hakata Dx spicy and that pork belly was literally melt in your mouth, the chashu has great flavor and just went too fast. In a blink I was done with my meal. My wife regular hakata tonkotsu and she enjoyed her as well. I ended up eating up the rest of hers. We had Ika Karaage for appetizer and it was decent  but probably would've been better fresh out of the kitchen.Cons: We all know Ramen absolutely starts with the broth and I was disappointed. 4.5 stars? I was let down. Broth was bland, not spicy what so ever. I was given a powder to pour into the broth myself. I've never seen that before. Maybe it's an SF thing. Also it was absolutely NOT spicy. Noodles were a little harder than I prefer as well but I'll attribute that to the downsides of takeout.Overall: I'll give this place a try solely because we did take out and I've rarely been steered wrong by my Yelpers but I do want to try my ramen spots before I leave. I'm rarely ever up in the bay.\", \"Stand in line and prepare to wait! If you can get through that, the food comes super fast and it's totally worth the wait. Nice presentation and flavors.\", \"Join the Yelp waitlist through their tablet at the front. When they get too busy near closing time, they close the waitlist so be sure to come early especially on the weekends! I know they have a few locations, but this one is located on the second floor of the Japantown plaza near the kinokuniya bookstore. The inside has quite a bit of seating but as to maximize seating, tables are close to each other so it may seem crowded. The staff here welcome you when you come in and round often to refill water and see how you're doing. I enjoy getting the shishito peppers for an appetizer, they can be spicy depending on the batch of peppers. My go-to ramen is the Hakata Tonkatsu Ramen. The broth is rich and creamy. The noodles catch the broth and are cooked well. You can add more toppings for an additional charge. You can choose your spice level: no spice to extra spicy and they have spice powder on the side if you want to make it spicier.\", \"I came here for a weekday night dinner and most of the tables were filled. The wait wasn't too long though (15ish minutes) and the servers are really efficient. I got the Hakata Tonkotsu which was just the right amount of savory without being too heavy. I also love a good, gooey soft-boiled egg.\", \"So if you ever see a crowd of people in front of a restaurant waiting for the next open table and wonder if it's worth it to join, if that restaurant is Marufuku Ramen, I encourage you to join.Fortunately, to join, you just have to sign in with your name and number on a Yelp iPad waiting list. Then, when your table is ready, you'll get a text message with a link so you can see your place in line. Around four or five places from the top, you'll get a text to come back to the restaurant, where you'll be seated pretty quickly.Although my wife has been to Marufuku dozens of times, this is my first visit, and it certainly won't be my last. After about a 45-minute wait on a Saturday night, we were treated to some of the most delicious Hakata-style ramen I've had in the city. We first ordered a couple of Sapporo draft beers ($6.75), a large sake ($9), and an order of Japanese-style fried chicken ($7) as well as the fried shishito ($6). Then, I ordered the Hakata Tonkotsu DX ($18.50), which means that it's like the regular Hakata Tonkotsu but bigger. And if that isn't big enough, you can always order extra toppings. Personally, I thought the menu serving was fine, but it's always nice to have options. My wife, having already eaten lunch at Marufuku, decided to go with the smaller Mentaiko Bowl ($5).Ambiance is great - lot's of dark wood. Very much a reminder of traditional restaurants I've eaten at in Japan. Service was fantastic. Everyone is very nice and responsive when you need more water, extra toppings, or more chopsticks when one of yours inevitably falls on the floor. And don't worry about asking for the check. They're so busy that they will tactfully have you paid up before your last few bites so that they can turn your table over for the next eagerly waiting customer.For sure, when visiting Japantown, give Marufuku a try. Just be sure you aren't starving when you arrive, because it may be another hour before you're seated - especially on weekend nights.\", \"We went on a weekday and it was still pretty busy, couldn't make reservations but we got seated almost immediately which was really nice, the hostess and the waitress were both very attentive. The place was recently renovated and expanded, it was clean with a nice vibe. I got the ramen with pork, I asked for it to be mild but you can choose your spicy level, and you can also add more chilly powder already at the table  if desired, I accompanied it with some apple sparkling juice which was super yummy too. The portion was generous and the ramen was so tasty. Various different waiters and waitresses checked on us constantly which was shied nice too. It was a bit pricey but I think that's normal for San Fran. It was so worth it and I would recommend this place for sure!\", \"My visit to Marufuku Ramen left me with mixed feelings. While I appreciated the lighter broth of the Chicken Paitan ramen, which offered a refreshing departure from the heaviness of traditional tonkatsu ramen, I couldn't help but feel that it lacked a certain depth of flavor that I usually associate with a satisfying bowl of ramen. The broth, though light, didn't quite leave a memorable impression.One of the popular dishes, the chicken leg, also didn't live up to the hype for me. It tasted fairly ordinary, and I struggled to understand what made it stand out among the other offerings. On a positive note, the restaurant's bustling atmosphere on a busy Friday night showcased its popularity, but it also meant a long wait for a table, which might not be ideal for those seeking a quick dining experience. While Marufuku Ramen has its merits, I personally lean toward a heartier tonkatsu ramen when it comes to choosing a satisfying bowl of noodles.\", \"Stopped by for lunch on a Friday and there was no wait. We got here at 11:50 and pleasantly surprised to find no lines!  The ambiance for very nice and reminded me of Japan with the service and greetings. I had the Hakata DX which had the larger piece of pork. The broth was excellent and noodles just right. I got medium spicy and it wasn't that hot.\", \"Marufuku is a very solid ramen spot and probably one of the best that you'll be able to find in SF.The ambience is very warm and cozy, and has a casual, home-y feel to it. The service was VERY quick - We literally had our orders taken as soon as we were sat and the ramen was brought out in no time.The ramen itself was very solid. Not the best I've ever had (compared to LA options), but still very good nonetheless. The Tonkotsu broth was extremely rich and tasty and the chasu pork was very tender and juicy. My only minor complaint was I felt the portion size was a bit on the smaller end for the price, but definitely recommend checking this spot out nonetheless!\", \"We came here on a lunch weekend and expected a longer wait time, but it wasn't that bad. When we checked in, we just went around the stores and when we got a text that our table was ready, we just went om our way. The whole party has to be present though before they can let you in. I ordered the Hakata tonkatsu and it was rich and flavorful. Husband ordered the same thing but Dx on spicy and he slurped it down in no time. They also have ramen for kids with sides of fries, chicken and pudding, served on kid-friendly bowls and utensils. Staff were friendly and attentive. The price was expected being that the restaurant is in Japantown and San Francisco. It's a family friendly place, as well. Until out next SF ramen craving! Totally recommended!\", 'No Fees', \"Trying this place has been a long time coming. I used to be in the 2 hour long wait line years ago but would try the restaurant next door because there was a less of a wait. I went here for a weekday lunch and to my surprise, there was no wait or waitlist open so I was seated right away. Food: My fiancé and I ordered the Hakata Tonkotsu. 20/10 it was amazing! They give you a hefty amount of noodles too. The egg was perfectly soft boiled, not overly runny either. The CHASHU was the star. My fiancé said it's the best chashu he's ever had. Most places tend to have a soft chashu without much texture but this one has a good chew. They only give you two though, like most ramen places. I was digging in my ramen bowl to find my other chashu because it was hiding under the noodles. Most tonkotsu broths tend to be very heavy and creamy but this one although was creamy, was just right and light tasting, which I liked. Something different that the ramen here has is pickled ginger and I wasn't used to how pickled it was but it added a bit of a crunchy texture to your ramen. The bowls here are SO pretty! They remind me of flower vases. Ambience: Very nice and spaced out. Great place to hang out! I haven't been there in awhile and took a minute to find it. It's located on the second floor of the West Mall. Parking: it's located in Japantown so the parking garage is where I would recommend parking. I can't wait to be back and might try their other locations too! I definitely want to try the Paitan ramen next time!\", 'Food was just Zoe.  Not bad not great.  Recommended to try with open mind Staff not real attentive', \"A must-go to place for all the ramen lovers. Went on a Saturday afternoon in a party of two. There was a slight wait and the waiting list had already been closed on Yelp, so we had to wait there. Since it's in the Japantown mall, there's plenty to keep you entertained while you wait for your turn. We got a table within 15 minutes, the servers were kind, welcoming, and helpful. They had recommendations for you depending on what you liked or what you were looking for. We got the Hakata Tonkotsu Ramen and the Vegetable Ramen. I was happy to see a vegetarian ramen option since it's difficult to find them, but would of course, appreciate more than one option in the future. The vegetable ramen was spicy, flavourful, came with a bunch of greens, a soft boiled egg, and spinach noodles. It had a lot of layers and was interesting to eat - a lot of different textures coming together as well. I'd ordered a spicy ramen but ended up adding more of their spice mix to make it more spicy. Pro tip - put the noodles in the spoon, and add some broth & veggies for the best bite and the maximum amount of flavour. It was very surprising to see a vegetarian ramen without any mushroom, but it was a welcome change! It's a lot of ramen and I was unable to finish it but I loved every bit of it. Would come back for more! My partner got the Hakata Tonkotsu Ramen and enjoyed it as well. He didn't require extra spice, and thought the broth was slightly on the oiler side. Marufuku definitely lives up to its name. Writing this review has made me want to go back and grab another bowl!\", \"Located in the heart of Japantown, Marufuku Ramen is a definite must try. I actually stumbled upon this location on my first night, but there was a long line; luckily, I was able to come back and try it with less of a wait!Food: I'm not a huge ramen fan, but if you're in the cold of SF, ramen eventually becomes a craving. I opted for their hakata Tonkotsu which was a savory, rich, pork-flavored broth filled with chewy noodles and tender pork slices. The broth was such a winner - not too fatty/oily and not too bland. The ajitama egg is a nice additional touch that wasn't an additional charge like most ramen places I've been to. I was highly recommended to try their Chicken Paitan ramen which I believe is another lighter specialty option. Ambience: Casual, can get quite busy. My friend and I were seated at a table that was pretty close to other tables so it felt a bit crowded. Service was quick and efficient. We got our ramens almost immediately. Parking: You can park in the Japantown parking garage! Pro tip: Get there a little earlier than you expect to eat and put your name on the Yelp waitlist. Then take the opportunity to walk around Japantown and visit the cute stores including Daiso! If not, you can also order togo or get delivery options!\", \"Had the pleasure of dining here with some friends from out of town. Surprisingly we didn't have to wait long and we were shown to our cozy table in the front window quickly. This place moves fast. The waiter came over right away. Since we had already been checking the menu we then ordered right away. The food came out in no time at all we started with the Takoyaki and chicken Karaage both were very good. My husband had the Chicken Paitan and he thought it was very good. I indulged in the Hakata Tonkatsu XD so I could get extra mushroom, bamboo and an egg. My whole party enjoyed their food. I've been here before and really like it. That said, the vibe can be a little rushed and while the ramen is consistently good, for me not as exciting as it could be. Not sure why.\", \"We went in on a Friday night and it was busy but we were seated fast. Not a huge fan of how close the tables are to each other...you literally have to bump into the person next to you to get up. The ramen was good though. Lots of toppings and lots of flavors in each bite. The egg was also really well seasoned and delicious. Service was also really nice and checked on us often. Plus it's open until 10 which is a plus.\", \"My boyfriend and I ordered the Hakata tonkotsu, he got ultra spicy and  I got the medium.We like to try each other's broth and his spice level was more of a medium and mine was barely spicy.One major thing I noticed is how SALTY my broth was from his. It was so salty I felt it in my throat and it was difficult to enjoy my ramen without broth.We mentioned to the waitress the difference in saltiness but she said all the ramen is made the same...not sure if someone had a heavy hand or something but I won't be coming back for mediocre ramen. I'm not the type to tell the waitress if the food is not to my liking but the saltiness was overbearing ...sad she didnt even try to remake it for me.Side note ambiance and decor is modern and clean and I love the bowls the ramen comes in.Also the chicken karrage is one of the best I've ever had across California, but I wish they gave a larger dollop of their mayonnaise.\", \"The food was great! Ordered the dx ramen and it tastes great. Also ordered the fried chicken. It was very large and had great texture.The server wasn't very nice near the end but I understand the stress they're under.The ambiance was great and was amazing for pictures.\", \"I love love love love Ramen so I was excited to try this well known restaurant. It is located inside a shopping plaza inside Japan Town in SF. I have heard the wait can be long and they only do a yelp wait list and no reservations. Luckily, we went on a week day right when they opened and we only waiting about 5 minutes before they sat us. The restaurant vibe is elevated yet cozy Japanese style dining. They have some tables that have benches that are suppose to compliment and mimic the Seiza style of sitting but without being on the floor. Service was fast and did not seem rushed. We waited about 5 or so minutes after ordering to get our ramen. We ordered the Chicken Karaage for our appetizer then the Hakata Tonkotsu with mild spice and the Hakata Tonkotsu DX with ultra spice for our entrees. The cook of the chicken was well done where it was juicy and not dried out. The breading of the chicken was also excellent that you can still taste the flavor and seasoning of the chicken without the fried breading overpowering it. The soft crunchiness of the chicken really brought the dish together because it didn't feel heavy after eating.As I said, I love ramen. So I was a little disappointed at this place. I wish the broth was a little bit creamier, savory, and had a little more unami flavor to it. I also wished the noodles were thicker than the ones they had. Another issue was the spice level. If you like your ramen spicy, I recommend going a level up. I ordered the mild spice and it was as if they had not put any in. Plus, my boyfriend ordered Ultra spicy for his ramen bowel and he ended up putting about 2-3 more tsps of the chili oil. However, the pork belly was good. It was tender and had a good flavor to it. All in all, I would recommend this place and give it another go. I saw they had a gluten free noodle option and I'm always down to try gluten free noodles! My\", \"Need to start out by saying I'm personally not a huge ramen fan, but marufuku is an SF classic. Located in the very unique spot of the Japantown mall, the vibes feel more authentic than other ramen places I've been to. Service is very friendly.We had the pork and chicken ramen. Both were very rich in flavor and delicious. We also had a side of the chicken karaage which was very good as well. The key with this place is to not get caught on the massive waitlist as they don't take reservations. You may need to come earlier in evening to not wait too long or put yourself on the waitlist and spend an hour walking around the Japantown mall (which is totally doable given all the fun stores)\", 'No Fees', 'After a long waiting time on a Saturday, we got in. They are very efficient on getting people in and out but the wait time is long. Their ramen and broth are very good, almost worth the long wait. The Karage chicken was excellent, and Gyoza was ok nothing special. The interior are comfortable and clean, but tables are very  close to each other if you seat on the banquette side. The only reason for one less star is because we felt very rush to leave since between ordering and the time food came happened very quickly.', \"The best ramen place I've tried so far in SF!Meat is always well cooked, has a lot flavor and this is the only place I eat tofu from. The place is always clean and the servers are always very friendly and fast. Great customer service, compare to other places.\", \"I mean what's not to love. Such great ramen.Portions are a bit small for the price and compared to other places, but will definitely still leave you full.The wait can be brutal.The restaurant ambient is very nice.\", \"Marufuku may be the best ramen spot in the city. I get the vegetarian ramen which had spinach, tomatoes, tofu, bell peppers, and a soft boiled egg. The egg was cooked perfectly through with a jammy texture. The spinach noodles are thicker than the original ones, which I prefer. The restaurant gets pretty busy especially on the weekends so I would recommend coming in 45min. to an hour early and walking around Japantown. You can write down your number when checking in and they'll just text you when it's time to be seated. While the wait is a bit on the longer side, the food is fast to come out once ordered. The ambiance is okay, the tables are a bit close together and it can get loud depending on the rush. As a tip, they don't let any outside drink or snacks in. (We usually walk around and get coffee before coming since the wait is typically 45+ minutes).\", \"Delicious ramen and great service, what more can you ask for? Most of my group got the DX ramen and I got the spicy tataman with chicken. I love how accommodating they were with slight alterations with the dishes because the folks in my group had different allergies. The food came fast and it was delicious. I wouldn't mind going back again.\", 'Our first time here. Very nice ambience, japan style. Bar and also tables. Place is quite small and hope they can be a bit bigger, noticed dine in tables were spaced very closely to other table and need to excuse. Food is amazing. Customer service is good, Friendly staff. We recommend this place.', \"I had the hakata tonkotsu and I would get it next time but ask for the red ginger, bean sprouts, and seaweed on the side. It was more than filling and if you want two meals out of it, I recommend ordering extra ramen noodles at the end (kaedama) and boxing up the broth to go, since I had so much broth left.The broth is delectable and the ramen is chewy and al dente, which I prefer. I'm normally not a fan of scallions and put them to the side but theirs I ate. The ramen egg was the perfect texture and flavored well by the broth.This location opened up additional seating in the adjacent storefront so the wait was only 45 minutes on a Saturday at 7pm (we walked from dumpling story to here once we found out that wait would be an hour...). We checked out a gift store / confectionary and j got some delicious San Francisco strawberry mochi there.\", \"I came here on a Sunday afternoon. It was busy, so there was a waitlist, but because you're in the mall, it's so easy to pass the time. We ended up waiting for about 30 mins. The waitress who served us was very helpful and patient when we needed more time. The ambience was great, very aesthetic yet homey decor. I ended up ordering the chicken paitan, after reading all the great reviews about it. And honestly, it very much lives up to the hype, the broth is rich and slightly creamy. It comes with other toppings like an egg with creamy yolk, generous portions of chicken, and many more. The noodles are springy and just hit perfectly. On a cold windy day, this hit perfectly.Overall, other than the price point and wait time, I had a great experience and would definitely come back. Still dreaming about this dish...\", \"It is mandatory for me to eat here when I visit Japantown!! This has got to be one of the best ramen spots. The line is always ridiculously long and it's for a reason!I got a Hakata Tonkotsu Deluxe and it was perfectly portioned. The staff seem to do a call and response when seating people which contributes to the atmosphere. I can't exactly say how, but I will just concede that it gives an air of authenticity. My only annoyance is that the waitstaff were hounding us to take our order. I understand there's time to look at the menu while on the waitlist but not if you have other things to do. It's a fast-paced environment so they try to get people in and out efficiently. Even still, they could probably get away with a lot and I'd still come back everytime. Good ramen is good ramen.\", \"One of my favorite ramen places in SF! Wait time can be more than an hour on weekends, but on weekdays they are shorter (between 15 - 45 min). Regardless, this place is well worth the wait. I normally order the hakata tonkatsu ramen. The broth isn't heavy and maintains the level of flavor and richness you'd expect from good tonkatsu broth. The noodles are also thin noodles on the firmer side which I enjoy.\", 'No Fees']\n",

      "Reviews: [\"One of the town's best for at least the 15 years I've been dining there. Open 7 days; indoor & street (park let) seating available. Some of the best Italian food in the city- featuring a rotating menu with everything from fresh,  house made pastas (my wife loves the gnocchi) to steaks and pork roasts. I've yet to order anything from the menu that disappoints. If there is room for desert- Seven Hills absolutely NAILS Panna Cotta... especially paired with a 10 or 20 year tawny. Arrive hungry and leave completely satisfied. The service is impeccable and the ambiance is both cozy and classy.\", \"Seven Hills was recommended to us by a couple of friends, definitely lives up to the hype! We came here for our anniversary dinner and it fit the vibe. We got the squid ink pasta, kale pasta, meatballs and focaccia. The squid ink pasta and meatballs were my favorite dishes. The meatballs had cheese inside, which I haven't seen at many places. The sauce was delicious, we finished the rest of the focaccia by dipping it into the sauce. Service was amazing, the waiter kept checking with us from time to time. Parking sucks in this area so I recommend parking on Polk and walking there.\", \"Love this place and finally took my husband for our anniversary dinner. Usually this was been my girls night out spot! I always get the truffle pasta. It's an off menu order but it's usually available. One order has ten pieces of stuffed pasta topped with freshly shaved truffles. I would suggest to split it. It's rich and you want to be able to enjoy other items. We also did the carpaccio salad. Though we notified the server about my seafood allergy they were super good and remade my dish sans seafood, the bagna caudo is anchovies :) We also shared their house special pasta with ricotta, tomato sauce and chili and my husband I both agreed this is the start of the night. Paired with the meatballs it was perfect to share. Chewy and Al dente pasta with light sauce, tiny bit of heat and rich cheese really hit the spot. The best part of the night was the dessert. We shared a budino which is my absolute favorite dessert and this place nails it perfectly. One of the best I've ever had. They also generously gifted us a sparkling muscato and ice cream. Please tip your server well and come to this local treasure! Let's keep restaurants like this in business. They truly care about quality, service, ambiance and overall experience. One pro tip. Don't bring kids here. While you can it's a quaint place to be enjoyed sans iPads or such. Please please do not ruin it for other diners by doing so even if it is an early reservations. Part of the charm of this place is the ambiance.\", \"I recently dined at Seven Hills Italian restaurant and had an incredible experience. From the moment we arrived, it was clear that this place stands out.Despite a slight delay with our reserved table, the staff quickly made amends by seating us at the bar and promptly served us drinks and water while we waited. As soon as our table became available, it was cleaned and ready for us.The food was the highlight of our evening. I started with the herb focaccia, and it was the perfect prelude to what was to come. The real star of the evening was the triangoli, which had an intensely rich squash flavor. It was unlike any Italian dish I've ever had, and it has instantly become my new favorite in San Francisco.What truly sets Seven Hill apart, though, is the speed of service. Our food arrived within a mere 5 minutes of ordering, and every dish was fresh and bursting with flavor. The attentive staff and their commitment to customer satisfaction were evident throughout our visit.Seven Hill Italian restaurant has made a lasting impression on me. From the warm service to the exceptional food, it's clear that this place knows how to create a memorable dining experience. I can't wait to return and explore more of their menu. Highly recommended!\", 'Very solid.This place did not blow my mind but it was a solid meal. The macaroni had a very satisfying tomato sauce. Fresh, herby, but not too salty. The tomato sauce was very very good. Almost perfrct. Thr dish went very well with the ricotta cheese. The', 'After walking for 9 miles around SF and on mostly over 1,000+ feet of elevation, we were so glad that this place was just couple of miles away from Lombard Street, where our internal batteries were just about drained from all the sight-seeing and walking.  It was too late for us to make reservations, so we called and asked if they had any seating availability. Thankfully, they did, but only at their outdoor patio, which wasn\\'t a popular choice at the time because it was freezing cold outside, but nothing a heating lamp can\\'t remedy.  In fact, they had multiple, warm enough and perfect for our hangry tummies.Of course, me and my young piggies ordered multiple items for our starved bellies and devoured each one swiftly, like a bolt of lightning LOL.  One we were starving, but also the food was amazing, especially their TOASTED GARLIC FOCACCIA BREAD.  It was so good, we ordered 3!  The other favorite was their TOMATO BRAISED POLPETTE, which the kids ordered as a meal paired with the MACCHERONCELLI, which they satisfyingly inhaled!I ordered their \"Market Fish,\" and at that time, it was the BLACK COD, which was deliciously prepared. It was moist, and every bite melted in your mouth so lusciously.  I paired this with their ORECCHIETTE pasta.  It was a bit much, and it felt heavy afterward, but my eyes were hungrier than my tummy.  The Orechiette was good, but it\\'s something I wouldn\\'t order again because of its density and rich sauce. It\\'s filling yet unsatisfying.Two of my nieces ordered their PAPPARDELLE with tomato and chili braised pork shank sugo, and they both loved it!  My son ordered the TORTELLI and paired it with their Tomato Braised Polpette. Their portions are small, hence multiple pairings of items.  Prices are average for the area, meaning it\\'s not your typical cheapskate Italian place.Our server was lively and cheery. He was informative as well and patient to go over their menu and specials in great detail.Although it was cold seated outside, we enjoyed the quaint, yet charming outdoor seating. Overall, we enjoyed dining here, and it\\'s walking distance from Lombard Street and a perfect place to grab a decent meal after a long, tiring walk around the city.', \"After our meal, we felt pleasantly relaxed. The atmosphere is cozy and intimate, making it an ideal spot for a hearty dinner before winding down. If you're after a calm, hygge-like evening, this is the place. Russian Hill is peaceful at night.Now, about the food:1. The TRIANGOLI pasta was outstanding. The honey nut squash filling was velvety, with a rich, buttery flavor, complemented by nuts and pomegranate. Truly a delectable masterpiece! I'd revisit this restaurant just for this dish, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to fellow diners. Each bite was a heavenly experience, leaving me longing for more.2. The Maccheroncelli lived up to its reputation as the signature pasta. The light tomato sauce and fresh ricotta cheese were a nostalgic touch. It summoned memories of childhood pasta. For me, the ricotta was the star of this dish.3. Orecchiette provided a satisfying chew, with a tougher pasta. I initially anticipated nuts, the more conventional choice, but the beans brought forth the perfect texture! As for the Garlic & Parmesan Focaccia, I can't recall much - it disappeared quickly!\", \"Recently came here to celebrated a birthday party for a table of 7.  We had a Prix Fixe dinner menu with a few additional a la carte items and omg, everything was so yummy.  A friend of ours brought a bottle of 2016 cab with a $30 corkage fee and we ordered another bottle of red while waiting for the first to be aerated, great wine and pasta just hits different.  Outside of our Prix Fixe menu, we also ordered the White Truffle Pasta ($80) and Uni Tomato Neri (Squid Ink $38) which knocked all our socks off, both dishes were rich, creamy and flavorful.  Everything on the PF menu was a hit; however, Maccheroncelli could have been skipped IMO.. the texture was a tad rough to chew, the flavor was there but none of us finished the dish.Overall, had a wonderful experience.  Our server was very knowledgeable and matched our degenerate energy.  I'd like to come back on a normal occasion to select from the menu or chef's special.\", \"The food here was spectacular. Every thing we ordered was delicious and surprisingly flavorful. The tomato soup starter was so amazing, my partner said he didn't want any, but then ended up eating half of mine. The corn agnolotti was also incredible, we licked the plate and would come back just for this. The basic marinara pasta, we didn't expect much from, but it was topped with a delicious ricotta cheese that we couldn't get enough of. The dessert was very good, but this one didn't blow us away as much as the other dishes. If I could I would give it 4.5 stars because although the food was incredible, it was overpriced. In my opinion the quality was similar to another nearby restaurant that has significantly lower prices. However, my ratings are based on deliciousness of food more than any other factor, so they get a 5 in that department.\", \"The food was a little overpriced for the experience. Service was friendly and attentive. Inside is a little dark and quaint so we decided to sit outside. The street seating is nice but the benches are a little bit high for the table. Food was good but not all the dishes were fantastic. Here are my reviews:Duck liver pate: was a little too sweet. Pate is alway rich, but this was exceptionally rich and sweet. The portions are big! Summer bean salad: nothing special. Good salad. I wouldn't reproduce. Pork chop: was one of the best dishes, the pork was tender and the grain was a delicious combination with the pork. Squid ink pasta: also was underwhelming, the flavor profile was not memorable. It was a tart tomato, salty combination Panna cotta: best part of the meal. Not too sweet, not too creamy. It was a perfectly light texture with a subtly sweet touch.  I would recommend the location overall!\", \"Beautiful Italian restaurant, although next time I think I'll sit inside. Wasn't a fan of the trolley passing by ever so often. Service was meh... it sucked lol but at least we had wine to hold us over. Food was amazing though! Definitely come for the food and bring good company. Thanks!\", \"Birthday dinner!!! Small restaurant made for dates or perhaps solo dinners. Came here for my reservation at 6:15. It was pretty busy for a Sunday evening. The waiters weren't very attentive. It took quite some time for them to get water, order food, or even just to see how we were doing. The food was good but not great. My duck liver pate as a starter was wonderful. It was flavorful and they gave me a good amount. My black cod was was cooked beautifully. The pork chop was a very different story. It was mostly fat. My boyfriend said he had to cut most of the fat off. It was very difficult to eat. They make their own sorbet in house. I enjoyed it, but it didn't sparkle. I wouldn't get it again.\", \"My new favorite Italian restaurant of all time!Came here for dinner and was greeted / seated immediately (they take reservations online, which is highly recommended because this place gets packed quickly). The inside is dark and romantic but very comfortable and effortless. This spot would be great for date night.I shared the herby focaccia, Sun Blaze Ranch Panzanella Salad, and  Chocolate Budino for dessert. For my entree I got the Agnolotti.Wow, all dishes were fantastic! The focaccia was airy. The heirloom tomatoes in the salad were meaty and juicy and seasoned to perfection. The Agnolotti was so unexpected but I loved it. It was essentially ravioli but with seasonal sweet corn. It also had some popcorn sprinkled on top. The dish was light and on the sweeter side. The Chocolate Budino was also amazing! The mousse/pudding wasn't too sweet. I was impressed. I'm a pretty big eater and I felt the portions for each dish were just right.Service was top notch. They checked on us frequently, asked if we had any food allergies before we ordered, refilled our waters, and wiped the table between courses. Everyone thanked us and wished us a good evening on our way out.I will be back to Seven Hills and would recommend this place to my family and friends!\", \"I had a fantastic dining experience at Seven Hills! Dining with friends from out of town, we were warmly welcomed by our attentive waiter, William H. His passion for food and attention to detail made us feel truly special. The restaurant's lively yet intimate ambiance added to the overall charm. The Americano Spritz was excellent, perfect for spritz enthusiasts like me. As for the food, the garlic parmesan bread and pappardelle were incredibly flavorful. No regrets here; I'm already planning my next visit to try more of their food!\", \"We celebrated my husbands birthday in the city! We made reservations in advance and were seated upon our arrival. We sat indoors as it gets cool in the evening. Table are a bit closer together but it is still cozy. The staff was friendly and personable. We had the American wagyu, marccheroncelli and the market fish. Food was simply delicious. Our server paired our food with a delicious red wine. If you're ever in the city we highly recommend seven hills it's a solid Italian spot !\", \"Seven Hills is one of my favorite date night restaurants-- the pastas change and are always the perfect al dente that reminds me what pasta texture should be. I'm always curious what new combination of house made pastas and sauces they will have on their menu. There are typically some chef specials as well with great, fresh ingredients. I have not tried them yet since they are usually pricier but it is on my bucket list. The duck liver pate had great umami flavor and I really appreciated the strawberries. I also always love their panna cotta and olive oil cake. Service was impeccable and as a light drinker, they were more than accommodating in splitting one glass of wine between my guest and I. Great wine selection too and we really enjoyed the sauvignon we picked.\", \"Oh my gosh. This is the best food and dining experience I've ever had! My bf and I came last night after hearing great things about it and boy we were not disappointed. Everything is fresh and prepared to perfection. Our server William made the experience even better! He gave us great recommendations and ensured that there was more than enough truffles on our pasta (doing the lords work lol). If you haven't come here yet, I'd make sure to make a reservation ASAP. You won't be disappointed.\", \"One of the top 10 Italian restaurants we've been to. And that says a lot from people living in nyc. The meatballs are the best we've ever had (also impressive coming from nyc). The garlic bread, kale tagliatelle and macorencelli all fantastic.\", \"Seven Hills is a cute Italian restaurant tucked away in the sleepy Nob Hill neighborhood. We made reservations for three at 5:30p and were seated in the back of the main dining room. Garlic & Parmesan Focaccia: this was buttery, soft, and cheesy! So delicious to share.Duck Liver Pate: this was the STAR of the show. The focaccia bread it was served on was crispy yet fluffy and the pate was delicious. I loved the strawberry jam on top to help cut the pungent-ness of the pate. Would 100% order again Agnolotti: this was a perfectly cooked Al dente pasta. I really enjoyed the fresh corn and the fun popcorn on top. Budino: creamy, luscious, I couldn't stop eating this! The food was excellent - I wish the pasta portions were 25% bigger. If we didn't order appetizers I think I would still be hungry. Overall I would say the service is pretty good, although I we did feel a bit rushed to order, to eat, and to order more wine. Our party was catching up with a friend visiting from out of town so it would've been nice to have a bit more space during the actual dinner. I do appreciate Seven Hills for letting us move to a new table for a post-dinner drink and to finish our Budino dessert before our friend's plane ride home.\", \"A Russian hill classic. If you're looking for an Italian restaurant in Russian Hill, Seven Hills is the best option.I come here pretty frequently, as it's two blocks away from my house.We always get a crudo and salad to start, three pastas (truffle tortellini, squid ink if they have it - these two are typically specials), and a protein (fish or steak). Save some room for dessert at Swenson's across the street, but if you stay for dessert, they have an excellent panna cotta.\", \"Seven hills is such a delight.A dark and warm lit restaurant, seven hills is such a staple to the neighborhood. The people there make you feel like you're a regular, and service is absolute filled with love. With an in depth knowledge of the menu and wine selection, the servers were so helpful in our decision. The focaccia bread is the ultimate star of the show, along with the squid ink pasta which I believe may be a seasonal choice. You cannot go wrong with any choice on the menu. Each bite is the perfect balance of flavor and texture. Definitely a great spot for friends, family, dates, and maybe even for a work dinner! Casual yet upscale.\", 'We live in the neighborhood and come often.  When I made the reservation for a birthday dinner (4 of us) for tonight through Open Table, I requested their wonderful table tucked away next to the bar.  I don\\'t have enough words of thanks to Seven Hills for that perfect table:  THANK YOU, THANK, THANK YOU.  Score!  We had the best possible time.  The food was simply outstanding.  The Little Gem Salad with Point Reyes Blue Cheese was extraordinary -- perfectly dressed, great texture, sublime.  The pastas were amazing, and our friend who ordered the scallops (a \"special\" tonight) will be raving about those scallops forever (she normally doesn\\'t finish her dinner whenever we go out -- tonight she ate every bite!).  Desserts all around were incredible.  Delicious wine.  Terrific ambience -- nice and quiet.  I wish I could give a million stars here on Yelp.  Thank you, Seven Hills.  BRAVO!!!', \"Parking is horrible, so I Ubered from Embarcadero and walked back. Food was delish and service was great. Place looks small, but there is a plenty of tables, a touch too close together. I can't remember everything I got since they change their menu often. I know the tuna tartar was really fresh and good. The Duck Liver Pâté comes on a big pieces of bread all ready for you to eat. It was delish. Their pasta is cooked perfectly and every piece of pasta was coated perfectly with the perfect amount of sauce. I know we got something with truffle and the squid ink pasta. Big thumbs up!\", 'Reserved online for 2 and came here on a weekend. I love this spot\\'s atmosphere and vibe, reminds me of a \"classic italian restaurant\" vibe that\\'s just perfect for anything. The service was great as well, our server was knowledgeable and able to recommend a few wines to complement our meal.The white wine was perfectly light and citrusy. The Strawberry Solstice was also light, but the strawberry/lemon and vermouth was perfectly sweet to complement a laid back meal.We ordered a handle of dishes and dessert to share. We got an Carpaccio, Agnolotti, a Dungeness crabspecial, and a Chocolate Budino. I found the the carpaccio and agnolotti decent, but for me the Dungeness crab special was the crème de la crème imo. It was delicious with black pasta and the crab was soft and juicy. This was my favorite dish of the evening.The Budino was beautiful and well worth. The biscotti dipped in the sea salt/cream and a bit of hazelnut was mouth watering. In hindsight, probably should have mixed the hazelnut and cream more, but we ate top down.Every time I go here, I am always satisfied by the atmosphere, service, the drinks and dessert, and at least 1-2 of the entrees/antipastas blow me away. Definitely a 5/5', \"I had such a nice dinner here on a Monday night. I ended up walking in and it was pretty busy. A lot of places in the neighborhood are closed on Monday so the host told me they get busy on those nights. This spot is definitely pricey. My friend and I had a bottle of wine, 1 app, 2 pastas and 2 desserts and our bill was about $234 without tip. Obviously we went all in but it was worth it and a nice treat to ourselves. I sat at the bar with a girlfriend and we loved everything. We got a bottle of red, a fish carpaccio which I cannot find on the menu I posted, the special which was a truffle tortellini, the maccheroncelli, the date dessert cake and chocolate mousse. Everything was really good. The one that stood out the most was the special, truffle tortellini. It was pricey, $56 but I think it was worth it. It had 10 tortellinis for the entree. I wouldn't have shared it if I knew how delicious it was haha, don't get me wrong the maccheroncelli was good but it stays on the menu. The dessert date cake was also a highlight for me. It was sooo good. The whipped cream was perfect. The service was great, our server was Ashton and he was so kind and helpful with the menu. We asked for his suggestions and he made the best recommendations. We loved everything we ordered.\", \"One on my favorite local Italian spots. Every time I return, it just reinforces the reason why I keep coming back. The dishes are consistently delicious. They have excellent service. The ambiance is comfortable, casual and chill, with small neighborhood vibe. Chef Tony and team offers creative nightly specials based on what's fresh locally that day. A sign of true passion for creativity, offering the freshest ingredients to diners, and providing support for local purveyors.The dishes:-Duck liver pate - rich and luscious pate smeared on toasted crostone, topped with kumquat marmalade served with a side of wild arugula.-Dungeness crab with squid ink linguine (special of the night) - fresh house made squid ink linguine prepared al dente, topped with a generous portion of fresh chunks of Dungeness crab meat served in a light cream sauce.-Imperial Wagyu flat iron steak - perfectly prepared tender Wagyu served with a delicious Black Trumpet mushroom jus, accompanied with asparagus and Mokum carrots.-Chocolate Budino - perfectly sweetened, served with hazelnuts, sea salt, Chantilly cream, and biscotti.Thank you Chef Tony and team for another impeccable experience.See y'all next time. :)\", \"Everything tasted amazing - zero complaints about the food and service!- garlic Parmesan focaccia (they mill their flour in house)- squid ink pasta special with Dungeness crab (my favorite item, would get again. Loved the the texture of the pasta and the flavor was so well balanced)- winter citrus salad (they use seasonal produce and it's easy to tell! They made use of a mandoquat fruit hybrid and it was great)- panna cotta (more mandoquat in action, again not complaining)Would definitely go back for other items.\", \"Another superb experience here.First of all, our waitress KimThi was such a pleasure. Such a sweet, good humored person, and friendly yet efficient. All the other staff who brought our dishes were really friendly too! Just adds that extra cozy something to an already wonderful meal.Second of all, our meal felt so elegantly creative without being pretentious. The yellowtail appetizer special looked and tasted like Spring, with bright, green, and early springtime flavors. The kumquat marmalade on the duck pate appetizer was so unique (the flavors together weren't quite a match for my personal taste, but I enjoyed them separately and my dining companion loved the combination). Finally, the pastas were a delight: the tortelli felt decadent but nuanced, without being cloyingly rich, and we were lucky to be there when there was a pasta special topped with plenty of sweet Dungeness crab. It seems like this restaurant really likes to incorporate seasonal ingredients without making a big fuss about it. Anyways, this was a hit, we will be back, and we highly recommend!\", \"I haven't left a review for Seven Hills? Shame on me. This is my favorite restaurant of all time!! I ordered nothing but the specials - all three, each time. The yellowtail, truffle pasta, squid ink crab. Wine list - so much to choose from.\", 'Fabulous Experience in this restaurant in Russian Hill! Came for a team business meal and everyone was super impressed with their meals. Every pasta was above expectations - particularly the the truffle tortelloni. I tried a little bit of everything in their menu. The crab ink pasta and truffle pasta special were to die for. Their pate crostini and salad were very packed in flavour. The desserts were excellent - taking my hat off for their panna cotta. Delicious! Service was impeccable and the ambiance was pretty modern Italian. Fresh and delicious - will come back !', 'Really enjoyed our dining experience here. Came to celebrate a birthday. We were seated in the main area. Lighting was dimmed a bit to set a more intimate mood. We shared everything we ordered. Started with the snap pea salad and duck liver pate. Salad was fresh and the duck liver pate was earthy but offset by the sweetness of the strawberry jam.For our mains, we ordered the fusilli and the wagyu beef. The sauce on the fusilli was rich but not too thick. The beef was very tender and served with potatoes and mushrooms. Our two desserts were both very good, but preferred the bread pudding over the panna cotta.Highly recommend reservations.', 'The food was fantastic. We started with  a meatball appetizer. Then we split three entrees family style. The service was fantastic. A real neighborhood  gem.', 'Fantastic and authentic Italian food. After making a reservation for our hotel, we always make a resy at Seven Hills.  Alexis and his team do a wonderful job.  Everyone is professional and nice.  Food is superb and wine selections are fantastic.  Hmmm, I think we need to plan our next trip to SF!', \"It's a very nice dining experience for a birthday celebration~ The duck liver was very flavorful and our favorite dish. The ingredients in the prosciutto salad work well together. The pork chop had good flavor but we would recommend well-done instead of medium. Overall the service and ambiance were pleasant too. Will come back~\", \"I've tried a lot of Italian places in the city, and this easily takes the cake. My friend and I walked in on a Saturday night with no reservation and got sat down immediately. The ambiance is cozy, intimate--truly the perfect place to wind down. We started off with the herb focaccia and duck liver pate. The focaccia was extremely fragrant, and truly enhanced the complimentary olive oil. The delightful candied kumquat cut through the duck liver pâté, a flavor combo I really wasn't expecting. This antipasti was crunchy, creamy, sweet, and bitter from the arugula-frisée mix. I would definitely recommend.For our entrees, my friend and I split the Fussili Lunghi and Pappardelle. You can tell that the pasta is extremely fresh as every bite had a bounce to it. The sauce of each dish was seasoned incredibly well and I left feeling very satisfied. On top of all the amazing food, our waitress Kim really took care of us and was so attentive to our needs. Her service was the cherry on top.I'll definitely be recommending this place to all my friends.\", \"This place is outstanding! I had been wanting to go for years but kept getting turned away for not having a reservation. My friend is moving after passing the bar so you know we had to celebrate! We had an 8:40 PM reservation and started off with the focaccia. It's so worth it! Perfectly crispy and soft. We shared a bottle of wine and the two special pastas the crab fettuccine and the truffle ricotta. They were not shy with the truffles and shaved fresh truffle from a box with the truffles in salt. Absolutely divine. We opted for dessert too because how many times do you pass the bar? We shared the persimmon dessert as well with a side of Chantilly cream. It wasn't overly crowded and the service was nice! We were being slow and taking our team. We were the last to leave the restaurant but everyone was really gracious about it. I highly recommend this spot for a celebration or romantic dinner.\", \"Seven Hills. I had heard those two words from many a friend over the past few months and I finally was able to get reservations, for my birthday no less! We trundled out on a rainy Monday night in San Francisco and got seated for our 8 pm reservations indoors. The restaurant was in a sleepier part of Russian Hill and surprisingly, there was no issue finding parking at all for us. We rushed into the restaurant to get out of the rain and got comfortable.Food review:Garlic & Parmesan Focaccia 5/5 - Yes. Yes. Yes. Three yeses. The focaccia had the most amazing texture with the parmesan creating a nice, crisp layer on top. What was so wonderful about this app was that the dough was seemingly made with whole grain or some other type of flour, not white flour. It gave it that much more bite. Get this no matter what!Tomato Braised Polpette 4.75/5 - There's something so classic about red sauce and meatballs. This dish takes that to a whole new level, with the sauce itself providing umami and pops of acidity throughout the whole dish. Spectacular. The only thing I would've wanted a bit more of is more of a prominent, deeper flavor in the tomato sauce but otherwise, sooooo good.Tagliolini all'Amatriciana 5/5 - Yummmmm. Oh my goodness the noodles were cooked the PERFECT al dente here. The bits of pancetta mixed in with the sauce provided little surprises here and there. It was such a nice dish - loved every second of it.Tagliatelle Pork Rib Sugo 5/5 - This was my favorite item of the night and I cleaned it up. The pork rib sugo was just mindblowing in flavor. The strands of pork rib meat between the al dente noodles were so good. The width of the noodles were a perfect vehicle for the sauce to rest on when taking bites of the dish. 1000% get this if you see it on the daily menu.Okay, okay this place absolutely lives up to the hype. For all the friends that were talking about this place, now there's one more friend talking about this place - me! Go please, you won't regret it!\", \"We loved our dinner here! Food was so tasty and service was wonderful! Pasta is made fresh daily, and all the ingredients seemed fresh and of quality.We ordered:-garlic focaccia: crispy yet fluffy, buttery and flavorful-beef corpaccio: tender and refreshing -beet avo salad: nice to get some greens in to balance all the carbs! loved the textures-truffle tortelloni: served with freshly shaved truffle! Tortelloni were filled with pockets of cheese and they were so yummy and fun to eat!-squid ink garlic lemon crab pasta: pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, with the harmonious combination of garlic and lemon made for such a scrumptious bite! That with the chunks of crab... *chefs kisses!*-sea bass: nothing to write home about, unfortunately...!Totally recommend all that we tried, except for the sea bass, which was a tad bit overcooked and didn't stand out really in any way. Our faves were of course the pasta dishes-- truffle tortelloni and the squid ink garlic lemon crab pasta! I believe those were the specials of the night; hoping they'll have it on their permanent menu soon!!\", \"Seven Hills is a farm to table Italian restaurant with lots of pasta and wine options. I came here last night for dinner- I recommend booking a table in advance, we called a few hours before dinner and they only had tables available outside. The heaters were pretty warm but I had to keep my coat on.The food was pretty tasty, we started with the garlic focaccia. It had a great garlic and cheese flavor and they gave enough for 5 people to share. I ordered the Maccheroncelli which a lot of yelp reviewers were saying was the best item- I thought it was pretty tasty, loved the ricotta cheese after mixing it all in, and it was heavy and I had a lot leftover. I wish there some meat or extra veggies though for the price ($26). I also tried the squid ink pasta with crab which was a special yesterday, and it was so tasty, lots of crab, and I was scraping the sauce from the plate. I did think the portion was a little small for how much it was ($38) but I guess it's what to expect from an upscale Italian restaurant! Overall good food and nice experience.\", 'The special yesterday was squid ink pasta with shrimp it was so delicious! Definitely recommend this place the quality is top tier and the restaurant has an upscale ambiance.']\n",

Their Saffron Risotto is GF and delicious.Service was very quick. Restaurant is bright and not too loud -- love that we could hear each other across the table. Plenty of parking on a Monday night.', \"I drive by here every day on my way to work and I never noticed there was a little gem of an Italian restaurant.I came here on a weekend night and was informed that they were fully booked out but they had seating at the bar. Sat down at the bar and we were promptly greeted and serviced. I got the limoncello cocktail (I forgot what it was called and their menu online hasn't been updated) and the rigatoni pasta. The pasta was probably one of the best pasta I have had in the city. It was super flavorful, not overwhelming, and good amount of clams. My only complaint is that the portion is on the smaller side because I finished the whole plate...which is very uncommon for me. The cocktail was delicious and strong. The service here was great. Very attentive and quick. No complaints. I almost hate that I love this place because it's a little on the pricey side but I highly recommend Ofena and will be back!\", 'I appreciate a fine dining chef opening a restaurant in San Francisco, but the west side (and especially sleepy Lakeside Village) is not the place to do so.We went on a rainy Saturday night and the restaurant was half full, 1/3 families, 1/3 older folks and 1/3 foodie types. It\\'s a strange layout with two seating areas flanking the bar (ask for a better seat if they to sit you by the kitchen).The interior is sleek and modern and they did a nice remodel. Parking is easy and Resy reservations were easy to make.No free bread at this place, so we opted for an upscale fried mozzarella instead of foccacia, which was cheesy goodness ($14). The marinara served with it was quite spicy.Next up was the \"deconstructed\" artichoke dish, which was bland with only one artichoke heart cut in half with greens and sliced red pepper ($18). It badly needed an aioli to dip and more artichoke. Definite miss and I would skip it.We both opted for pastas, knowing it would be fairly small. Husband had rigatoni with clams in a butter sauce, which was good but he counted 8 clams ($28). I had the gnocchi carbonara, which was quite good, with chunks of duck prosciutto on top ($29). They were pretty light yet filling so enough for a meal.We completed the meal with a panacotta ($11), served with lemon curd and mandarin orange slice, which was quite good. We each had two glasses of Failla Chardonnay ($18/each) which added up, but they had a decent pour.They add an automatic 20% gratuity and though they tell you, there is still an option for additional tips on the credit card checkout. Total bill was $228 for two people and we were still hungry upon leaving. Though the food was good, I don\\'t think we will be back. If I pay $100+/head for small portions and two glasses of wine, I\\'m going downtown for fine dining in a nicer neighborhood. They need to read the room and adjust their menu and pricing to succeed.', \"I was super excited a new restaurant was opening around my neighborhood! This used to be the old Lakeside Cafe and now it's newly renovated to be more elegant but also causal. Ofena is a great Italian spot by the owner of Ju-Ni and the Handroll Project. This place is pretty spacious and has been super busy since they opened. I recommend making reservations through Resy.I've been here a couple of times with my family and we think the service is great! They are friendly and also willing to answer any questions about the menu or drinks.APPETIZERS: -Warm Focaccia with Roasted garlic, olive oil, and aged balsamic ($8): Great starter! It came with around 6 pieces! I love the focaccia and spreading that roasted garlic on top! -Funghi Misti Arancini ($16): Came with 4 total Arancini balls! They are mushroom deep-fried risotto balls and they are a great starter as well! It is just the perfect bite!PASTAS: For all the pasta, our server warned us that the pasta dishes are of smaller size and I agree. -Gnocchi Carbonara ($29) came with duck prosciutto, pecorino, and salt-cured egg yolk grated. I've had this twice and one time it was perfect and the second time the gnocchi was a little grainy.-Saffron Risotto ($32) came with grilled shrimp & squid. I love the seafood that it came with but the risotto itself was slightly undercooked. The favorite was overall good!-Rigatoni alla Vongole ($28) came with clams in a butter lemon sauce. This is probably my favorite pasta dish. The clams were huge and I just enjoy a simple sauce. SECONDI ENTREES: All the Secondi entrees come with a choice of one side. The Secondi entrees are what I highly recommend. -Pork Bistecca Fiorentina ($34): The pork was perfectly cooked! It is definitely shareable.-Beef Steak Tagliata ($49): The steak was solid! You can't go wrong with a steak!-Today's Fish Picatta (MP): It was a seared yellowtail and it was my second favorite entree! It was seared and the middle was still slightly raw.-Fried Chicken Cotoletta ($29): Probably my favorite dish! The chicken cutlet was juicy and had a perfectly crispy outsideSIDES:-Grilled Broccolini: Best side, you can't go wrong with a good broccolini with browned butter-Soft Polenta: It was pretty filling and I love a good truffle mascarpone-Crispy Smashed Potatoes: It came with a chili relish and it was my second favorite side-Romano Beans: It was in a red pomodoro sauce. I felt like it was slightly overcooked because I like my beans to have a slight crunch. DESSERTS:-Panna Cotta: The best dessert! It was silky and refreshing-Chocolate Tiramisu: Slightly disappointed because it felt like a twist on a tiramisu. It was more of a chocolate cake with espresso powder and cream.-Pumpkin Cannoli: It came with two cannolis and it was solid! Overall, I am definitely coming back for those entrees and appetizers! I do think the place is pretty pricey but I love to support a local spot. I've always had a great dining experience here and it's our go-to spot in the neighborhood.\", \"I've been noticing a lot of neighborhood restaurants opening up lately and I am here for it. Ofena is one of those places that makes you want to come back and be a regular patron. The place is spacious with some booths as well as long tables for large groups. We were seated at the window which gave us a nice view both inside and outside.  Our server was very friendly, checking in on us regularly, leaving us to feel attended to but not hovered over. I loved the delicata squash appetizer and the spaghetti with the rich beef sugo. The pork steak was very juicy and tasty. Food came out quickly and was well paced out. Next time I will try to save room for dessert. If you are looking for a solid Cal-Italian spot with a seasonal menu, this is a great place to check out. Parking is fairly easy. I'm looking forward to my next visit here.\", \"Great new Italian option for SF! Read about this place in Eater and thought it would be interesting since I've had great experiences at Ju-Ni and Handroll Project.First I will say the food is excellent. The portion sizes are reasonable for the price and everything is fresh and delicious as expected.The service was satisfactory for a casual dining spot. They don't really go beyond the norm like Ju-Ni or Handroll, but I guess that's not the target audience. One feedback I have is that since we got seated at a small table, there wasn't any space to put our stuff and there was barely enough space to put all the plates. Ideally they could provide under chair baskets or hooks to store or hang coats/bags.Overall I'd probably keep Ofena as an option. It is a little far from us to go regularly, but at least there is a stop on the M line right next to the restaurant (20ish minutes from downtown).\", \"After hearing so much buzz about the opening of Ofena (from the restauranteur behind Ju-Ni and Handroll Project) I brought the family for dinner. The ambiance was elegant yet casual and we saw a mix of couples and groups, and a few families. We sat in a comfy booth right in front of the mural depicting the opening of the Twin Peaks Tunnel, which they kept from the previous Lakeside Diner. Lots of metered street parking (free after 6pm!) and also very close to the M Muni train stop and Stonestown Mall. APPETIZERS: We started with the fluffiest warm focaccia - you can order three different toppings so my daughter had the roasted garlic/olive oil/aged balsamic and I had the butter and anchovies. For appetizers, we had the Funghi Misti Arancini (if you like mushroom risotto, imagine them breaded and deep fried!), Yellowfin Tuna Crudo, and Fried Mozzarella (a must try!). PASTAS: The Gnocchi Carbonara came w/thick pieces of duck prosciutto, pecorino, and salt-cured egg yolk grated on top. If you're a meat lover, you'll love that the Spaghetti alla Chitarra comes with beef sugo sauce, Italian sausage, and a meatball. SECONDI ENTREES: Our server highly recommended the Pork Bistecca Fiorentina, which was tender and grilled to perfection - and my husband's fave dish of the night. I really really loved the Fried Chicken Cotoletta which came w/a slightly sweet gypsy pepper sauce; the cutlet was super crunchy and crispy on the outside and juicy inside (I called dibs on the leftovers for lunch the next day). SIDES: When you order a Secondi entree, you get to pick a side of your choice from the menu, so we got the Grilled Broccolini w/browned butter that added great flavor and the Polenta w/truffle mascarpone which was heavenly. DESSERT: We had the prettiest slice of Tiramisu, and also loved the Cannoli with an amazing fresh strawberry cream filling.\", \"My husband mentioned that this restaurant opened, so we booked a reservation since we were going to the city. Restaurant sits on Ocean Avenue, illuminated with an orange neon sign. We got there a little early and got seated momentarily. We had a party of 4 so we shared a couple of dishes.Pane1) Foccacia with Butter and Anchovies - we loved the foccacia so much we ordered another. The butter and anchovies was also good. Needs more anchovies. Antipasti2) Yellowfin Tuna Crudo - Unfortunately I don't know if the fish and prosciutto worked in this dish. I like them both as separate entities in a dish I guess. It's sweet yet salty. Prime3) Saffron Risotto - The squid in this dish was quite good but the risotto was a bit salty. Prime4) Gnocchi Carbonara - Though it was good, this was also quite salty. I actually used some foccacia to eat part of my portion. Secondi5) Pork Bistecca Fiorentina - My husband had mentioned this dish was highlighted in the recent article, so we ordered it. I will say no comment as I am not a fan of this cut of pork usually. It was good but wasn't special. My husband did say he liked this better than the steak. Secondi6) Bone-in Beef Steak Tagliata - You can't really mess up a steak but my party wasn't feeling the balsamic on it. I liked this better than the pork though. Contorni (comes with Secondi)7) Grilled Broccolini - I think I personally like broccolini and the char gave it nice flavor.Contorni8) Heirloom Summer Squash Caponata - I actually loved this. This was actually one of the more flavorful dishes in my opinion .. Dessert7) Tiramisu - Not quite a tiramisu but the essence of one on a chocolate cake. It was good but so decadent, so I'm glad it was shared.Service was great at the beginning, but as it got more busy it was harder to catch the servers attention. She was very nice though.I'm a bit sad that the best thing we ate was probably the focaccia. I know they're a newer restaurant so I may attempt to come back later in the future. Their fish of the day sounded enticing and I wish we had ordered that. Service: 3.5/5 - Ambiance: 4/5 - Food: 3/5 - Price: 3/5\", \"We had a lovely date night at Ofena.  To a person, service was attentive and friendly. Our server Stephen recommended our favorite dishes.Drinks:* My hubby had a couple of Negronis and a glass of Chianti, all were very good* I'm a big fan of the non-alcoholic Lurisia ChinottoFood (all tasty):* Fried Mozzarella Carozza* Crispy N'duja and Mozzarella Arancini (one of my favorites)* Gnocchi Carbonara* Pork Bistecca Fiorentina (the other favorite)* Creamy Gigante Beans (it made us want to start cooking these at home)It's nice to have a fancier restaurant in the area. We enjoyed our dining experience there!\", 'This place is phenomenal. Every dish I had was beautifully plated and full of flavor. Each bite honestly almost brought tears to my eyes.. I didn\\'t have a reservation (as it was a last minute decision) but I was able to be sat at the bar pretty quickly and received full service. Both bartenders were so friendly & attentive and gave great recommendations!My favorites were the fried mozzarella, arancini, yellowin tuna, & the broccolini. (A.k.a. Everything I ordered haha)The drinks were also delicious. My favorite cocktail was the \"c for cookie.\"I can\\'t wait to come back during my next visit! :D', 'Got a question about Ofena? Ask the Yelp community!', \"Absolutely loved my dinner here. My family went on a Thursday and we had an amazing time. Our server was very friendly, and the service was great, but the food and drinks were standouts for us. We had a few more dishes that we forgot to take photos of. We had leftovers and were very happy to eat them the next day.  Everything was phenomenal. Didn't get photo of gnocchi, but boy was it delicious. The other pastas were top notch as well. I will go back just for the fried Mozzarella and rigatoni vongole. Can't wait to try more dishes. The space is quaint and cozy. I believe 80 seats, including bar. Love it! So happy this place is in SF.\", \"A Fantastic Feast at Ofena! Ofena Restaurant, tucked away at 2529 Ocean Ave in San Francisco, is a real gem that recently got a wonderful makeover. The new look inside is playful and cozy, creating a perfect setting for an unforgettable meal.The menu at Ofena is a true celebration of flavors, and they're not shy about giving you plenty to enjoy. The portions are big, great for those who want bang for their buck. What's even better is that they're considerate of dietary preferences when preparing your food. During our visit, my friends and I decided to share a couple of starters and a pasta dish, and boy, were we happy with our choices!We kicked off with the Heirloom Squash Giardiniera and the Chilled Artichokes for our starters. Both were fantastic, showing off fresh ingredients and the chef's talent in blending flavors just right. The colors and how they presented the dishes added to the overall joy.Next up was the Gnocchi Carbonara with duck prosciutto for the pasta course. It was heavenly, with those fluffy gnocchi and the zingy bacon creating a delightful dance in our mouths. It left us eagerly awaiting what was next.For the main course, we tackled the Pork Bistecca Fiorentina, Bone-in Beef Steak Tagliata, and Fried Chicken Cotoletta. Every dish was a masterpiece, proving the chef's skill with perfectly cooked, tender, and flavorful meats.Amazingly, even after such hearty portions, we somehow found room for dessert. The sweet treats were the perfect ending to our food adventure, leaving us completely content.Ofena Restaurant isn't just a place to grab a meal; it's an entire experience. With its charming new look, comfy vibes, and a menu that's a taste sensation, it's a genuine treasure in San Francisco. Whether you're a local on the hunt for a new favorite spot or a visitor seeking a memorable dining experience, Ofena is a spot you don't want to miss - it's sure to surpass your expectations!\", \"Ofena is such a wonderful new Italian restaurant in Lakeside! We sat at the bar (very comfortable and great service!), and had cocktails and dinner (highly recommend the 'Stemware at Dolores' and 'Lost Boy'). Ofena's menu has a wide range of small plates, pastas, and larger entrees, so you can really just drop in for a quick bite on your way downtown or have a full dinner. The yellowfin crudo and fried chicken dishes were delicious. Will definitely be coming back - what a great addition to the neighborhood!\", \"A truly worth foodie restaurant on the west side. I recommend doing it family style where you get a combination of antipasti, primo pastas, and meaty secondis. It's pricey for the neighborhood but well worth it considering it is besting many Michelin starred restaurants that rest of their laurels.\", \"This place use to be the old Lakeside Cafe and the interior still reminds me of it.  We came on a Thursday early evening and were the first customers there.  They sat us at a nice booth facing the outside window.  We started off with some house greens ($15)  that was tasty and well presented.  For our main course we had Saffron Risotto with shrimp and squid ($32), a Fried Chicken Cotoletta ($29) and a extra side of broccolini ($11).  The food was beautifully presented and that is big plus to the kitchen.  The service was also good.What I don't like about SF restaurants and this is one of them.  There are hidden charges.  When I looked on line, there were not any shown.  But at the bottom of the menu is a 20% service charge even for a small party of 2.  There was also a charge for SF health added to the tab.  I generally do not dine at places like this and that's why I prefer Italian food either in Burlingame or places that do not have these charges.  They should have just rolled it into the price of the food and try not to make excuses for extras.  This might be controversial, but I think this is deceptive and because of this, I knocked it down 1 star.\", \"Great service, our waitress was attentive and helpful. I'm going to start with dessert because that was my favorite  the ice cream came with three scoops, one  cherry flavor I wanted to take that homes and eat a pint of it all by myself, it's that good! The chocolate tiramisu, they use cake instead of lady fingers, seriously one of the best I've ever had! So much espresso flavor in every bite soaked in! I got the duck gnocchi, it was a small portion for the price, but tasty! I honestly thought I would leave there hungry, but I was full after. My friend got the pork chop which I had a few pieces of, it had so much flavor. For appetizer we shared the mushroom arancini balls, so freaking good it you love mushrooms  and the tuna crudo was also delicious! It was the perfect pairing with the melon and prosciutto. This is a place I would go back to for sure, but be prepared to pay up! Haha\", \"Such a pleasure having dinner here with friends last night!The menu and food are fantastic. I'm not Italian, but I felt like I was at Sunday dinner with my Italian grandmother! Service was extraordinary. We are so happy to welcome this great restaurant to this familiar and missed location. Highly recommend!\", 'Ofena in San Francisco exceeded expectations with a culinary experience that left a lasting impression. The steak was perfectly cooked, tender, and full of flavor, while the Gnocchi Carbonara showcased a delightful blend of textures and rich taste. A must-visit for those seeking a memorable dining experience in the heart of the city.Our server was Stephen and he made the experience even more memorable.', \"We were truly excited to support and have a new restaurant in in that area as Lakeside Cafe and Villa D'este were gone. Really happy they are taking a chance on that area for SF locals. Sadly, it was not good. I have hope though they will work this out. We'll be back in a few months. Gnocchi was a very small portion for $29 and flavors were meh. My wife got the rigatoni and it was not good. She has all the love for al dente but this was not edible. I quickly ate the gnocchi which was a few bites and my wife did eat the clams, but left the rigatoni noodles since they were close to raw. They took the food and we asked to try something else since we didn't really eat that much and were still hungry. We had the arancini which is okay. I guess it would not have been so underwhelming if the price was so high vs. what we received. Negroni and Aperol spritz were good. I guess they bumped the bill up but if the amount is distracting for me, than I know the food was a problem. Truly, honestly, hope they figure this out and improve. Gotta be tough to start a new restaurant and will try them in a few months again. Maybe other selections were executed better? Hoping they make it through. The place was packed on a Friday night, so maybe we were just an outlier.\", \"Inventive antipasti and fresh pastas are backed up here by well executed classic main dishes.  The sides were very fresh and in season. I was very happy with the vegetarian options, especially the persimmon mushroom plate and the bean dishes, but there's not a lot on the menu for vegans. The service is beyond what you would expect for a neighborhood joint, and the dining room and bar areas are cozy and relatively spacious. It's a fabulous upscale addition to this stretch of Ocean Ave. that complements the more casual lunch places nearby.\", 'Got a question about Ofena? Ask the Yelp community!', 'So happy to see this place in the neighborhood. The food and drinks were all delicious! We loved the pickle juice martini. The rigatoni with clams and the steak were both terrific. Looking forward to visiting again!', 'If the mountains surrounding Lake Garda are too far for you I recommend this gem of a restaurant for a mouthwatering meal. From the smiles that greeted us when we walked in the door to the decadent dishes, this place is a marvel tucked away in the most unexpected place. I appreciated the thorough consideration of dietary restrictions and the attentiveness that the servers provided, especially our server Rachel. Each dish was perfectly executed with care and attention, ensuring all courses provided the perfect flavor and balance. Creative, yet just classic enough to satisfy that craving for a good Italian meal - I will be returning ASAP', 'We had a great time at Ofena!The cocktails were awesome, the food was delicious and the staff was super attentive and helpful.They were even able to handle a very difficult customer next to us without missing a beat.Ofena is worth a try!', 'Came here with my wife without a reservation but hoping for the best.  Friendly staff all around from front of house to the bar area to the general wait staff.  We sat in two open seats at the bar counter which was perfectly fine.  We ordered three items for dinner followed by a dessert.  1.  Gnocchi Carbonara2.  Spaghetti alla Chitarra 3.  Bone-in Beef Steak Tagliata with Soft Polenta*Dessert* Spumoni Gelato SundaeI want to make it clear that I know this place is newly opened and I intend on making a return trip probably in a month after this place has had a chance to truly settle in.  1.  Gnocchi had nice texture.  Sauce was flavorful, rich, and smooth.  Portion was on the smaller side but I understand that pricing includes labor, skill, and ingredient choice.  I would have liked a larger portion but this was fine provided you come with the mindset that it isn\\'t likely going to be your only dish.  However... the issue of this dish was the saltiness. It was very salty.  Admittedly I tend to put less salt at home when cooking, but my wife who is a fan of strong flavors also found this to be very salty.  Reducing the salt a touch would take away any real gripe against the dish.  If I were to apply a 1-10pt scale on just the salt issue, with 1 being no salt, 10 being dangerously salty, and 5 being just right... I would say this was a 7. 2. Meat ball and sausage were well seasoned and had good texture. Same with the sauce.  Same with the noodles.  Texture and general seasoning-wise was very enjoyable.  However, much like the gnocchi above, the salt content was \\'impressive\\'.  If the man serving us at the bar happens to read this comment, he may be able to identify me in this comment by the fact that I kept saying the word \"impressive\" after a few bites because I wanted to avoid saying anything overtly negative... but I was saying \"impressive\" because the salt level in the spaghetti dish was noticeably higher than the gnocchi which was already strong.  If I were to apply a 1-10pt scale on just the salt issue, with 1 being no salt, 10 being dangerously salty, and 5 being just right... I would say this was approaching 8.5. 3.  The steak was an excellent medium-rare.  The balsamic based sauce was a good choice and, color me relieved, this dish was not salty like the first two.  It was well seasoned all around.  I would get this again but possibly with a different side.  I chose the soft polenta more as a curiousity than as a known-favorite.  I think it was decent given what little I know of polenta, but I will try something else alongside next time - this one is on me and does not impact my general view of the dish.Again I would come here for a second shot and order the Spaghetti again just to see if my experience tonight was a one-off on the salt level.  I would then order two other dishes to get a fuller scope of the food. I am keen on giving the Pork Bistecca and the Eggplant Parmesan a try on my next visit.', 'Great new addition to the neighborhood. We had dinner there on Day 3 and everything went pretty smoothly for a brand new restaurant. The restaurant was buzzing with guests at 7 pm on Saturday night, glad we had a reservation. Ambiance is great for date night or small group dinners. Bar seating is also available for more casual outings. The service was warm and friendly. Nice cocktail and wine list. All the food we got tasted good, and the piccata and romano beans side were our favorites. Looking forward to returning to Ofena to try everything else.', \"Ofena is a great new spot for a special dinner in the area. Highlights were the focaccia, the broccolini side, and the Steak Tagliata. So much flavor! I definitely suggest taking the servers suggestion share items so you can try more things. Pasta dishes were in the smaller side for a main entree, but perfect when shared with apps and an entree to split. The staff here are incredible as well. Very warm, knowledge about the food/wine and extremely welcoming. Amy was our waitress, and she was fantastic and deserves a special shout out for such great service. The hostess, whose name we didn't catch, was so nice as well! We can't wait to go back already.\", 'Fantastic place and perfect addition to ocean Ave!For a restaurant that just opened, they are doing a fantastic job.', \"I was very happy to see a brand new restaurant open on Ocean Ave. In the Lakeside neighborhood. It's been at least 10 years that this previous site has stood empty so I was anxious to sit down with my family for dinner at Ofena. This is an Italian restaurant with a broad selection to choose from. The food was very good, but the servings were small. I can't say the same for the prices. You're charged $5. for a small serving of  bread. $3. For garlic flavored olive oil and $4.00 for butter. Need I say more ? The service was great, and the atmosphere was very nice. This restaurant will attract first time customers but I can't imagine very many return guests. There are plenty other excellent restaurants in San Francisco. So sorry this welcome addition to the neighborhood is a disappointment,\", \"Food and service were exceptional. Quality of ingredients showed up in every dish. I've always enjoyed Chef Tim's cooking and this was no exception. Thanks for another great meal!\", \"off to a great start!! overall good and service great food some constructive feedback:- consider some more sauces with the meats (we had the chicken and pork, chicken cooked perfectly pork a tiny bit dry) -don't wipe tables between courses with rubbing alchohol cloths/wipes, no reason for us to breathe those strong alcohol vapors while we eat-a little too pricey for us other than special occasions-great neighborhood addition we will be back to check on things soon\", 'Got a question about Ofena? Ask the Yelp community!', \"We ordered the artichoke, the focaccia with garlic for appetizers & was extremely pleased!   We also shared the steak with potatoes & green beans with potatoes. Each dish was absolutely fabulous. The service was great as well.  Our only complaint was the noise level.  We unfortunately were surrounded t two groups of females who apparently didn't know how to act.  They were so loud the manager/owner apologized & promised to seat us in a quieter area on our next visit.  Also sent a desert on the house.  We will definitely go back but sit in a quieter are.\", 'Very nice place, good food and service! Seafood risotto is amazing! Pork also delicious.', 'Nice ambiance, easy parking, great food and friendly service. Their cocktails are yummy too!', \"This was a solid 3 star experience. I had hoped for more but I was quite underwhelmed by the food. We had ordered the following:Focaccia: Very good with the anchovy butter though wouldHave liked a few more anchovies and a little less butterSquash gardinera: Good with the onion mostarda though the ratio of onions to squash was way off. Way too much onion and very little squashArancini: Most disappointing dish of the night. Flavor was meh and the coating was way chewy. This isn't a hard dish to make but somehow it was so disappointing Gnocchi Cabonara: Didn't love it. Wasn't a special dish at all and I usually love carbonaraSpaghetti with the sausage and sugo: good not great. Pork: This was a good dish but not special. For the prices I would much rather go to Flour & Water and Cotogna. I had really hoped for this place to be better for these prices and for what the owners have done with their other 2 restaurants Service was fine and ambience was good.\", 'Wonderful upscale dining experience. Excellent wine list and attentive service. Recommended: tuna crudo, steak, focaccia w/anchovies&butter, summer bean salad Our only complaint was the pasta dishes being heavy on the lemon', 'Delicious. Awesome service. Recommend the pork chop and spaghetti dishes . Drinks are creative. Happy to have this in the neighborhood.', \"Warning: long review mostly geared for locals: Finally, after waiting for more than a decade, the space that was Lakeside cafe on Ocean Ave has been filled! A friend and I had dinner at Ofena tonight so here is the scoop from my perspective. Sorry it's long but hopefully it helps someone.  Staff: love! From the hostess, to the bar tender Mikey to the server Amy to the guy who cleared the dishes, all personable, professional, likeable and they work hard. The food: I thought it was quite good. We started with the focaccia and garlic olive oil, we both had the fish picatta which tonight was sushi grade yellowtail. Each main dish entitles you to a side, (everything else is a la cart) so we had broccolini and crispy smashed potato. We each packed up about half our entree, most of the bread and some potato and veg, then split the panecotti  (where is spell check when you need it?) for dessert. I was happy with each selection as well as the cocktail. Price point: too high to be one of my neighborhood hangouts, which would have been really nice. The a la cart items add up quickly and I did my research so I knew that would be the case. The meal I described for 2 was $180, which includes the 20% service charge, which I also knew was automatically added before I came. I appreciated that the server made a point to mention it bc I think it's probably a pain point for some who don't realize it going in. I really hope they do well. My suggestion if they want regulars like me from the neighborhood. Fresh Bread and butter/oil should be offered complimentary at any Italian restaurant IMO--it doesn't need to be fancy or endless amounts. It just makes a statement.  Just provide a few pieces of basic sour dough and butter and let people pay extra if they want a specialty bread like focaccia or garlic bread. Charging extra for oil to dip the bread in, to me, is a culture shock. Please consider including a veg and starch with the entrees, about a quarter of the quantity you provide when it's ordered as a side would do really nicely.Now maybe it's my age (67) and maybe the a la cart model works for enough people that business will continue to flourish after we've all been there once, and if so, more power to you. This is just my personal perspective. I'm sure I'll be back, but I can't afford to come here often, much less treat a group of family or friends. Still, all best to the new kids on the block and to any who go there, Bon Appetite!\", 'Food was hit or miss w some items either too salty or simply average.  Considering the portion sizes and cost, value is simply not there especially when there are so many great new Italian options in the city like La Contessa, Corzetti, etc.  For the neighborhood, its lack of value and lack of creating a memorable experience food or service wise makes it difficult to be a usual go to spot.  Nice to try but no one from our party is asking to go back.', 'For a recently opened restaurant food was top notch Servers were on top of it  They anticipated everything without being intrusive We will be back', 'We came to check out Ofena on opening night! What a nice addition to the neighborhood. The service was very good. Highlights were the wine , cocktails and desserts (panna cotta and the chocolate cake). We did think for the prices they charge, the portions were way too small. The artichoke appetizer was fresh and tasty. We shared the pasta with clams and the fish of the day. The pasta was fine, but a bit undercooked and we thought there would be more clams. The tuna at $42.00 was cut seared sashimi style and slightly cold in the middle. Again, for that price, we were expecting a full grilled fillet.  I hope that the Ofena succeeds. Unfortunately, we went home hungry.']\n",

Once I got there, the lady (boss? i think) was super nice saying to just put my name down on the waitlist and said it would take about 15 minutes. We (party of 4) got seated and the lady (same one) said to us very enthusiastically \"ITS COLD. I\\'LL GIVE YOU SOME MILK TEA.\" She proceeded to ask us what flavors we would like, sugar preference, even asked us if we wanted pudding or lychee jelly. We all went along with her and gave her our preferences, thinking all of this was on the house. I guess it\\'s also our fault that we didn\\'t clarify but it turned out to not be free. I just wished she would have told us that it would cost money. We all ended up spending $24 on drinks that we wouldn\\'t have ordered if it wasn\\'t on the house. Other than that, the food was good. I got the sichuan beef flavor that\\'s 3 fire signs but tasted like 1 fire sign. Kinda gross tho because one of my friend had a piece hair that\\'s not from the head in one of their side dishes. Aight TLDR- don\\'t get scammed when they say lemme make you some milk tea and double check if it\\'s free or nah. ngl the milk tea is good but not good bc i feel scammed. ya knur?? food was good.', 'We ordered the tomato beef soup and green pepper fish fillet soup. Both were delicious, but if you are looking for something with more of a kick, I would definitely order the green pepper fish fillet. The drinks were also really refreshing and the decor was cute!

Big value for money!So the concept is similar to hotpot but it's just real hot soup with sides and noodle (deconstructed noodle soup)The most spicy soup on the menu was flavorful, not too spicy. All ingredients felt fresh and well served. I was going to order chicken soup which is creamy and non spicy but I opted for pickled pork soup instead which I definitely think was a better option.

The bridge with ten different side dishes to add to your noodle soup is one of its unique qualities and made my dining experience here super entertaining. For ~$25/pp, my friend and I left this restaurant positively stuffed with popcorn chicken to go. As someone who constantly craves mala flavors, I loved the green pepper soup. The broth was also scalding which makes it a great dine-in experience and a perfect option for rainy days in the Richmond. Tip: try the chili oil at the table with the fish fillets -- it's super tasty!Service was super attentive.

Food was solid and I loved the little plates of food on the bridge and how they were presented. Ate the whole bowl swiftly and appreciated how I could customize it with the sides.

Service was prompt and engaging throughout the entire meal! I ordered the sichuan spicy broth with beef. The components of the soup are presented on a bridge which I thought was super cute! The beef and noodles are all served separately, so YOU are in control of what and how much goes into your soup. The beef was yum and I thought a lot of the side add in's were just ok.

I also had to ask for pepper (they don't have it in the togo option). The boba was decent but was big and didn't finish. I will come back next time but ask for more salt if it isn't salty enough.

Popcorn chicken was ok too.I think overall food would be 4/5 but service presentation and pretty interior bumps it up\", \"Ever since I had one of the best crossing the bridge noodles in Brooklyn NY's Chinatown, I've been wanting more. A couple places in the Bay Area sell this noodle dish but all of them left the craving unsatisfied. When I saw an Oodle Yunnan post, I knew I had to grab my husband (the driver) to take me there! He got the #1 original crossing the bridge noodle. One sip of the broth got us both cheesing hard. The owner stopped by to tell us about the homemade broth which is simmered for hours. I got the #7 green pepper fish filet cause im a sucker for anything that's spicy with fish. The broth was out of this world flavorful! The owner told us he has many customers pack leftover broth home to add noodles to. I would've done that... if I didn't drink most of it already. We got an order of their popcorn chicken to share which was perfectly crispy on the outside and steaming hot and juicy on the inside. The fried basil flavor carried over well too. I saw a couple reviews mention the small portion size but I felt it was a perfect amount of food for us. I got pretty full at the end and I have a big appetite! My only complaint is that Oodle Yunnan is out of the way for me! 5 stars!\", 'Came here during their soft opening. We ordered 2 Crossing Bridge Rice Noodles and a popcorn chicken. The Crossing Bridge Rice Noodles dish consisted of an extremely hot bowl of soup with the noodles and meats on the side and the toppings neatly decorated on the bridge. After putting together the dish in this order of meat, noodles, then toppings, the dish tasted super fresh and healthy as everything paired well with the flavorful pork bone and chicken broth. It was quite a refreshing dish. The popcorn chicken is also good. I recommend eating that first before it gets cold as the main dish will remain hot due to the hot bowl it comes in.The staff was super attentive and kept coming back to make sure we were doing well. The waiter politely informed us on how to put together the dish. The waitress asked us how HER soup tasted, so I assumed the soup was her recipe and that she was one of the owners. I overheard that same waitress and waiter, who I assume is the other owner, boast about their Thai tea being the best in the Bay (not sure how true this is since I did not order it), and the waiter even told us about the popcorn chicken.The restaurant itself is kind of small and tight, so this restaurant may not be ideal for bigger parties. Overall though, loved the inside and the vibes of this place, and the food was super good! The man also convinced me to take the rest of my soup home, so I can pair it with whatever noodles at home since it would have been a waste to waste the good soup.', \"I like the broth, I like the variety of ingredients and the beef quality.   However I cannot give it more than 3 stars if I am still hungry after paying $25.  There is simply not enough protein included.  I would have to pay another $5 plus tax and tip to be satisfied.  I wasn't expecting to pay for more than $30 for yunnan noodles.  It's a good concept just overpriced.\", \"Everything here is so good.they boast the same quality of food. Their decor is more polished though, with sleek seating and cute irregular cloud mirrors along the walls. Parking can be an issue and they also don't take reservations, so plan your visit accordingly. I went with my family of four on a Saturday at 11:30am and were seated immediately, though the line got packed right after, with wait times up to 1.5 hours.Oodle Yunnan Rice Noodle was a very  great and good.I like  their service and also their food.The food was so delicious and  when I will back I will come here. The owners are clearly passionate about the food and the service.The owner is super nice as well.Service was attentive and the owner came to check in with us multiple times. I like it very much. Highly Recommended.Highly Recommended.\", \"We decided to try the new restaurant on Balboa Street called Oodles Yunan Rice Noodles. With such a cute name, how can you go wrong?I had the Chicken Rice Noodles and was impressed! The homemade bone broth was fragrant and delectable!!! The silken rice noodles had an excellent texture and was perfectly Al dente. The shredded chicken, fresh vegetables and accompaniments paired perfectly. I couldn't finish and took the leftover home. Hubby had the Hot and Sour Fish Fillet Rice Noodles. The homemade hot and sour pork bone broth was very tasty and the fish fillet and vegetables were nice and fresh. He thoroughly enjoyed it. His dish disappeared quickly. And he took a lot of my noodles. I also had the Fresh Lemon Bomb Green Tea with Aloe. It was very pleasant. I was worried that the lemon would have a drying after taste but it did not. Hubby had the Thai Me Around (classic Thai milk tea).The service was excellent. All the servers were extremely attentive and cordial. They provide instructions on which order to add the food into the soup. Great customer service!The restaurant is new, clean, organized and inviting. We will definitely return!\", 'Nice presentation but expect to be rushed through the whole thing. The original, the mala and the green peppercorn based were pretty good. Expect a wait before you can get a table. Overall though pretty decent yunnan over the bridge noodles.', \"Great service, Great drinks, Great slurps Stopped by for brunch and it did not disappoint! The service was very welcoming and attentive. You can tell that they really do value their customer's experience. Our server recommend the popcorn chicken as appetizer and it was on point. Meat was juicy with a crispy mild spicy crunch.I also tried the original crossing bridge rice noodle and it's honestly one of the best I've had. The broth isn't too bland or salty which makes it so appetizing to crave more. The owner also told me that they used to open a boba shop! I tried 2 of their fruit teas and they're both very refreshing and pairs perfect with steaming hot noodles. Overall, a great little spot for authentic Yunnan rice noodles!!\", \"Great place to eat on a cold day! We tried the  crossing bridge rice noodle and the fish fillet with pickled cabbage rice noodle. The broth is so flavorful and the rice noodles have a great texture. Also loved all the variety of small dishes that came on the bridge. The restaurant also serves boba drinks which is great if you want something sweet to go with your noodles. Service was great and staff was super friendly! The intertior is super aesthetic as well! Love that there's a new noodle restaurant in the Richmond and can't wait to come back!\", 'Great place for a \"different \" type of meal. Soup served naked and you put in the different ingredients to your liking. Very flavorful broth.  Very nice staff that explains the process to you. For a different place to go, this is the place!', 'Tried the #1 and #8 noodle soups.  Enjoyed #1 original better.  The ginger milk tea  was delicious.  The cucumber appetizer was yummy.  Friendly owner and staff.  Definitely will be back to try out other stuff.  New to come would be cold noodles and other stuff.  The fried buns with sweet condensed milk and ginger milk tea are not on the menu but should order.', \"We were craving for something soupy and found this on yelp and decided to give it a try. The store is not super obvious so we walked past it once or twice before going in. The server was friendly. He greeted us the moment we stepped in. We ordered the following: - #1 - Crossing Bridge Rice Noodle- #2 - Yunnan Spicy Small Pot Rice Noodle- D1 - Panda Milk Tea- S1 - Basil Popcorn ChickenMy friend said the Yunnan Spicy Small was pretty spicy so I didn't give it a try. The soup base for the Crossing Bridge feels pretty clean. We both really like the popcorn chicken. The server gave us some sweet and sour sauce to go with it. The Milk Tea feels OK. The server checks in on us every 5-10 mins so we feel really appreciated.\", \"I've been walking by this restaurant every day waiting to see when it would be opening and it's finally soft opening! I came here two days in a row during their soft opening because it's just that good! The bone broth here is delicious - you can tell there's no MSG added and it's very flavorful. My only complaint is that the portions of noodles are too small - at this price point, the noodle portions should be bigger.They're a bit short staffed at the moment and still ironing out the kinks, so the first day I went, they were busy and the service was slow, but the second day I went, service was extremely fast.\", \"A new restaurant just opened up in the outer Richmond! I believe we came for their soft opening and ordered the popcorn chicken to go. Hot, fresh, tasty and can't wait to come back to try their noodles.\", \"Went on a weekday night and most tables were full! It was a small restaurant with a cute aesthetic! Like how it was like picnic tables but i feel like if you were taller the tables might be bumping your legs. We got three different noodle bowls, the crossing bridge rice noodle (7.510) where it was very light and comforting. It came with think beef slices which you should dump into the hot soup. You should dip it right away so the meat can cook properly. We also got the sichuan spicy beef stew (8/10) where the beef stews was flavorful and wasn't tough to eat, the soup based tasted like mala. Lastly we got the tomato spam (7.5/10) which was not spicy even though it looks like it. It was light and the tomato flavor wasn't too strong! One thing was the service even though the food came out really fast, as we were kinda of finishing the workers were hovering and starting to ask if we want to take things away. We felt like we were getting kicked out, I understand it was getting a little busy but they way they approach us did not feel too good. When the check came and I was trying to pay the tip since I paid in cash, the coworker was hovering again and it felt super uncomfortable, I was not able to calculate right and end up a lot more than I wanted to.\", 'Had lunch at this place while in soft opening! The interior was aesthetic and the presentation of the food really up-ed the vibes. It was so fun to see the toppings on little bridges :-)Group of two ordered the Tomato Beef Brisket Rice Noodles and the Green Pepper Fish Fillet Rice Noodles + drinks. The tomato broth was flavorful and a great non-spicy soup. The beef was super tender and pulled apart easily. The Green Pepper Fish Fillet was super yummy as well and had a nice peppery kick to it. definitely recommend the Supreme Fruit Tea with mango popping boba; loved sipping it with my tomato rice noodles! The owners and servers were quick to take our orders and were very sweet! Will definitely come again after their grand opening to try some other dishes.', \"Very good food and great service!! The noodle bowls are unique with many condiments and don't miss out on the basil popcorn chicken!!\", \"I'm a sucker for flavorful bone broth and slippery noodles with a perfect chew, and Oodle really delivers. This is soul food for me. Service was warm and impeccable, felt so welcome and taken care of the crew. Love the bench seating arrangement. Love that Oodle made a home in my hood and really look  forward to visiting again.\", 'Tried this place out during its soft opening.  Overall service was fast, ambiance was very friendly and the food very tasty.  We ordered the lemon bomb aloe green tea drink at 30% sugar level-super refreshing; basil popcorn chicken with sweet & sour sauce was a nice appetizer with a hint of spice; the original soup noodle dish (#1 on the menu) and the chicken soup noodle dish-of the two, the chicken broth was the more concentrated and flavorful.  It was a fun experience getting to add ingredients into the (very hot) bowl.  Would come back!Pro tip-use the bathroom before you visit as their bathroom is very small and tucked in behind the kitchen.', \"overpriced. Me and my boyfriend both ordered 2 sets of noodles. We were super disappointed when it only came with 1 bridge to share. Also portions are small and super not filling. I looked at previous reviews and saw that people got 2 bridges when they ordered 2 noodles. I don't understand why we only got one.... My boyfriend even questioned if that was it and the waiter said that we were supposed to share. Honestly don't know how this place has such high ratings. I feel like its a copycat version of Ten Seconds, which in my opinion tastes way better\", \"Great noodle soup on Balboa! I came here with a friend on a Thursday around midday, and the place was fairly busy! There isn't a lot of seating, but there was a lot of turnover, so the wait wasn't too bad for anyone that walked in. I ordered the fish fillet rice noodle soup. I had to step out for a call while we were waiting for our food, and by the time I came back in, my food was already there, and it cooled down significantly. The server (I think the owner?) was SO nice and gracious, that she helped me heat my soup back up again so that I could enjoy my meal properly! I really appreciated that she was able to do that for me! The soup and toppings themselves was delicious, and I was glad that I could experience it nice and hot! I also got the Dragon fruit lychee smoothie and it was SO delicious that I ordered another one to bring home! The server/owner even suggested drinks that they could make that weren't on the menu, and I opted to also take a Hokkaido milk tea home as well! Overall, the service, food, and drinks were all amazing, and I will definitely be back to try more of their items!\", 'A very unique find in the whole Bay Area and I ran into it!  Amazing noodle with the right texture and no matter what flavor you order, the soup base is really out of this world.  Discovered they just opened 2 days ago but it feels like they have been making the same soup noodle for the past century.  Service is great and do not forget to order the Popcorn Chicken.，', \"It was a cold and rainy day and actually makes it perfect for a hot bowl of noodkes. I came before with a big group but this time came alone and that's when you can really taste the food. This time I wanted to try the tomato beef brisket noodle soup and this one is also very good. The beef brisket and the noodles were good but it was the soup that did it for me. Soup had a perfect blend of tomato and was flavorful and aromatic (without being salty). I also like their wooden tables and wooden utensils and decor. I am going to have to try their other variations and their boba.\", 'My craving for a nice comforting soup was answered. Unique flavor. Small friendly spot. Nice hearty soups with rice noodles. We will definitely be back and we will eventually try the entire menu. If you like milk teas/Boba/smoothies/etc - the Green Tea Watermelon w/cheese Creama is going to be addicting. ***gluten free***', 'Why did nobody want to hang out with the Chinese noodles?Because they were Mein. We saw this restaurant on yelp and had great reviews so we decided to check it out. Cons: Parking can be a challenge with limited spaces available.There is no AC or Fan inside.The benches are not comfortable and not spacious enough MSG in their soup even when told there was not. Portions are tinyIt was pretty pricey for what you get $$They were stingy with their napkins and waterThe servers/owners they were too attentive and asking how the food was before we started to eatPros:The noodles had great flavor Serving Size were tiny, they give you a small tray of noodles and beefGreat display of the wooden bridge side dishes to add to the brothBeef Brisket and Quail Eggs for Add on are a must Popcorn Chicken', \"New noodle/ milk tea spot that opened in the outer Richmond. Small location and not too many seats so getting there when it opens is good.Got the crossing bridge rice noodle and tomato beef brisket rice noodle with popcorn chicken and the tiger milk tea. The soup for both were delicious with a lot of flavor and sat light in the mouth. It was not overwhelming with salt or msg and was easy to drink the entire soup if wanted! Everything tasted great. I was mostly surprised with how good the popcorn chicken and milk tea were. Popcorn chicken was juicy and seasoned nicely. The milk tea was very smooth and brewed with flavor. I waited 30 minutes for the boba as it wasn't ready since they just opened, but it was worth the wait!Overall great service and tasting food. It's worth checking out for a full meal or even just their drinks/snacks!\", \"The soup is boiled for 12 hours without MSG. There's different flavors of soup base. Their boba drinks are amazing too. I had the silky smooth Thai milk tea and Hong Kong milk tea with ginger. Both tasted amazing. Service is good too. Also, try their homemade hot sauce. It does get a little busy on cold days so be prepared for\\xa0a\\xa0short\\xa0wait.\", \"I've been on the search for a GOOD Crossing Bridge noodle restaurant since I moved to SF in 3rd grade, and I am so happy that I've finally found THE restaurant. The quality of the broth is rich and flavorful, yet not too heavy. You can tell they used high-quality ingredients and cooked the broth for hours. I finished the whole bowl of soup without needing to drink any water! The only thing I'd like them to improve on is their portion sizes. For almost 20 dollars a bowl, you only get around 6 small pieces of beef, and I was sadly not full after my meal. Lastly, the service is great! The staff is very attentive and warmly engages with each customer.Can't wait to visit again soon!! Overall: 4.5/5\", \"Pros: - Exceptional tasty soup(s). We tried the original (1) and hot & sour (3). They're the best I had in the Bay Area. It was so tasty that I asked them to pack our leftover soup to go. - Smooth rice noodles. They're so light and smooth. Again, the best I had in the Bay Area. - Unparalleled service. The lady boss is so nice and professional. She took the initiative to greet and introduce their menu to anyone who would be unfamiliar with Yunnan rice noodles. She checked on every table to make sure everything was fine. The rest of the servers were very attentive as well. - Their popcorn chicken is near top-notch.Cons (nitpick for a soft opening): - Servers need better training. Except for the bosses, the rest of the servers were pretty lost. They're attentive no doubt, but they kept on making mistakes (appreciate the apologetic attitude) and they can use a softer tone when it comes to communication. I understand, that hiring food service workers is hard these days.  - Serving size. We're small eaters and we ended up ordering an app to feel full. It would take a double noodles serving for an average guy. Similar to Reman joints in Japan, a second serving of noodles for free (or a small charge like $1)  would be nice.  -  Not a con necessary. The bench is not very comfortable to sit for a longer time. We typically finish our meals in under 45 minutes in a noodles shop. I get it that the hall won't fit 6 tables if chairs are being used. There is no problem for us, just come to think about others.It was soft opening day #5 and it was pretty amazing. I was skeptical when I saw the 5-star reviews. OK, confirmed that it's a 5-star kinda good for a new restaurant. We'll definitely come back.\"]\n",

      "Reviews: [\"Normally the hubby and I hate Asian fusion because all the places we've gone to have been disappointing. But this place was actually a pleasant surprise. We were pretty lucky when we came in because we were the first ones there. The restaurant was pretty spacious and had a date night type vibe with the semi dim mood lighting. Definitely kid-friendly since they had high chairs and plastic dinnerware available (plate, bowl, utensils and a sippy cup with a reusable straw).We ordered the:- Corn Cheese was a surprisingly nice combo- Honey Butter Boneless Fried Chicken was sweet, juicy- Bulgogi Taco was yummy, but I would've preferred more kimchi pico de gallo- Tonkatsu Ramen (not spicy for our daughter) was pretty good- Grilled Pork Belly (must try!)- Chocolate Tartufo for dessertThe tapas were so flavorful and delicious, but my favorite was the Grilled Pork Belly plate served on a sizzling cast iron. Every bite just hit the spot for us.The service was pretty decent since the waitresses were attentive and would clear our empty plates immediately and refill our water periodically. They were also really friendly even though our toddler was embarrassingly loud sometimes. We definitely want to come back to try the rest of the tapas.\", \"Pretty good fare in a popular spot on Geary. Classic SF parking situation, but it's a cozy, boisterous restaurant inside with good service. The chicken-jjim was really good! I wholeheartedly recommend the specialty dish here; I was pleasantly surprised by the flavor and sweetness of the chicken. The ramen, however, was definitely on the less impressive side of things. The soup was savory and rich enough, and the noodle texture complimented the dish as a whole. The chashu was a bit disappointing, as it didn't match the quality of the rest of the dish. I'll have to come back and try the tapas others are raving about, but I might just look for a different ramen place if I were craving that.\", \"What a delicious meal! Thanks to the yelp community I saw a common theme while reading through these reviews-- to skip the ramen and soups, go for the tapas and plates! Assignment understood!!We tried the -honey butter boneless fried chicken: crispy, tender, flavorful! -pork belly salad: pork belly melted-- was the perfect amount of fattiness without being chewy! Agree with others that the kimchi was overpowering, but still delicious nonetheless!-okonomiyaki fries: what a fun spin on fries, and I killed this lol as I always do with good fries-soy garlic chicken jjim: so used to eating galbi-jjim, I had no idea there was a chicken-jjim!! Chicken was so tender and had that classic sweet and salty jjim notes. We added half cheese, and that with the glass noodles were so yummy! Wish adding rice cakes was an option heh..We enjoyed everything!! I'm excited to come back and try other items on the menu! Attentive and nice staff!\", \"Still as good as the first time I've been here. Their bibimpap is very tasty. Their side of salmon is still my favorite. I wonder if they can actually make their salmon bigger as an entree itself since that's THAT GOOD. The servers are very attentive & friendly. Parking can be hard, but location is worth it since the food is great & you can even walk around the street and find a dessert place after you eat here. (Haven't tried their dessert yet) Ambiance is still the same inside. Small, but very warm & matches the vibe of their food. Totally recommend this place!\", 'Stumbled across this spot and so happy we did! Everything tasted super authentic and has a nice spicy kick too it which I love. Soft boiled egg in the ramen was cooked perfectly and the broth was amazing. Corn cheese is always a must. Service was quick and responsive. Restaurant is quite small but we went during a good time, I can imagine it getting super busy. Typical sf parking situations, we usually find free parking a few blocks up.', 'Came for dinner with some friends and had no problem getting seated! We ordered a bunch of dishes for the table to share including - spicy chicken jjim, super cheesy and a must- beef short ribs- corn cheese- seaweed fries- kimchi stewService was great and food came out timely. Loved everything we got and overall very solid place for some good korean food', 'The vibes here were just right! It had a very cozy feel to it as soon as I came in. The service here was very quick and staff was very friendly. The food def exceeded my expectations. Ended up getting another order of the boneless chicken in soy garlic. The sizzling bibimbop was the perfect portion and was able to take home leftovers!', \"If there's one thing about me, I will always try something I see from food reviews on Tik Tok. Jijime is one place that caught my attention! On a trip with my sisters, we decided to check this place out. We came in pretty late but it was still somewhat busy. Luckily, we were able to be seated within 10 minutes. We ordered two marinated beef bibimbap bowls and their boneless fried chicken (flavors: spicy and soy garlic). Food was delicious. After a long day, this really hit the spot. The inside of this place was cozy! Service was timely. Would definitely come here again for their chicken and to try their other dishes.\", \"On a Monday night around 6:20ish my friends and I were quickly seated as there were only about 3 other tables occupied. The service was great and the staff was very attentive to refilling water and taking away dirty plates.. I liked the concept of Asian fusion tapas since I like to try different things instead of getting full off of one entree. The food arrived quickly and I ate two pork buns, corn cheese and soy garlic boneless fried chicken. As a girlie who hates bones in my chicken, I thank Jijime for offering boneless fried chicken and karaage! My only complaint was that the pork buns were cold when everything else arrived hot on sizzling plates... the pork belly just ain't as good as it should be. I used my friend's hot plate to reheat my bun.\", 'Solid meal, but perhaps not the go-to place for Korean tofu soup. We had a 25 minute wait at 7:30 on a Saturday. Good service.Based on my scanning of Yelp reviews, the tofu stew looked a little controversial with varying different opinions. Since I was really craving soondubu, I decided to try it anyway, prepared for a twist on the classic dish. I got it without bean sprouts (which I saw in others\\' pictures) and not spicy. I wish there was a mild option (I should\\'ve asked) since this one was not very colorful. Taste-wise, it was alright. It was satisfying but it wasn\\'t amazing. If my tastebuds are accurate, it seems like they added miso to the soup. So it\\'s like a hybrid soondubu/miso soup. Still, it was savory, filling, and the pot it comes in really keeps the soup warm throughout your meal. However, there\\'s not that many pieces of meat (like others mentioned). I also wish they gave more rice.

Nothing to write home about. Relatively thin and wavy. The noodles didn\\'t have any flavor of their own. They were cooked fine, but felt like the smallest step above instant ramen quality. (4.1/10) Broth: A very odd tasting broth. Rich, milky, creamy, but didn\\'t come with any distinct/interesting flavor. The \"Sesame\" was undetectable. It had the looks & consistency of a really rich, well-blended, tonkotsu broth. But, the flavor wasn\\'t there. There was an odd aftertaste that I couldn\\'t quite pin down - almost like boiled broccoli. Odd.(3.2/10) Egg: A whole soft-boiled egg. That\\'s it. No flavoring/marinade to speak of. Pure plain egg whites. The yolk was solid around the very liquidy at the center; not the desired golden-jammy consistency that you want. Just dropped a plain egg in there, because why not?(4.1/10) Meat: Two thick-cut, grilled, slices of pork belly. It wasn\\'t a traditional sweet-chashu flavor. Just sliced pork belly thrown on a grill. The smokey flavor was pretty good, and it was well seasoned, but the high temperature made the pork belly tough and chewy. The fat/meat ratio was high - almost 50% on one piece. Tasted like a chewy, overly fatty, grilled slice of pork chop.(3.2./0) Misc Toppings: Huge scoop of fillers. Wood ear mushrooms, bean sprouts, and green onion. They didn\\'t add much to the bowl.(3.4/10) Other: The bowl looked promising.

I feel like it'd be ideal to come here with a group of like 4-5 people so you can try more items.I visited with my friend and we ordered the Boneless Fried Chicken with the honey butter marinade, as well as the Tonkotsu Sesame Ramen and the Bulgogi Plate. Every item was hearty, comforting and delicious. The fried chicken was simple but insanely crispy and juicy -- might truly be one of the best fried chicken dishes I've had. I also really liked the Bulgogi Plate. It's such a solid, balanced, umami dish, and I love the addition of the glass noodles. I feel like for the amount and the caliber of the food, the prices are very reasonable. We also got hot sake, which was such a good deal! The food does take a little while to come out to the table, but understandable because it's quite busy. I'd say come earlier on weekends if you can or make a reservation over the phone!\", 'Good service.. ok food. Clean restaurant.We were a party of 4.

Everyone working that we interacted with was super kind and attentive. 5 stars for sure. The food was a solid 4 stars. We ordered everything to share, which I think is probably the best way to go here. For 3 people we ordered: - Pork belly salad: we loved this! It was fresh and the flavors were all there. It's a great thing to order along with whatever other fried tapas you might get. - Fried Aki legs: fried octopus with dipping sauce. This was good! pretty standard- Boneless chicken wings with soy garlic sauce: Yum!! Satisfied a week long fried chicken craving. It was super crispy. - Chicken JJim Plate: Cheesy and spicy with lots of chicken and glass noodles. I liked the veggies in here too. - Kuro Ramen: this was not our favorite and a little underwhelming. The noodles were too soft and the flavors were not very strong. I would probably just stick with the plates here! Although the plate was good, I would be more interested in coming back for just the tapas and a drink :)\", 'Came here on a Friday night, they don\\'t take reservations over the phone or \"within 30 minutes\". It\\'s a sign in when you get to the door and wait kind of ordeal. It is a popular venue, we had to wait about half an hour before we were able to be seated. The waiters were nice and tentative. I would recommend their Korean dishes over their Japanese dishes like their ramens. We ordered a lot of things to try. Our favorite were the soups (oyster soup and non spicy tofu soup), and the bibimbap was pretty good as well! The tonkatsu sesame ramen was rich and creamy, it felt like an endless amount of noodles (which isn\\'t a bad thing) but i was stuffed, I couldn\\'t finish my charsiu. I always judge a ramen dish by the way they cook their eggs and they did great! The restaurant was cozy and asian Japanese/korean traditional feel, with dark wood interior and artwork of san francisco or food. we had the table near the door with a breeze coming in every so often which was a little annoying but bearable. Would come back for the bibimbap!', \"3/11/23 Saturday at 8pm. 4.5 stars Nice staff that works with you; I called them half hour before to ask for a table of six and they quickly assembled one. They allow you to put separate tabs if you started your order order off that way. It's becoming more clear as I come here more times which dishes I am very happy with and which ones less favorable to me. I didn't like my spicy pork plate (first time ordering this here) as more oily and and had a strong butter aftertaste than I want. None of the appetizers I've ordered to date has disappointed me.And hello? $5 large hot sakes and $3 for extra noodles on ramen? Thank you for being a TASTY and BUDGET FRIENDLY place.\", 'Excellent food. Service was pretty good actually quite good. Nice little place with a warm ambience.', \"I visited JIJIME for the first time on a Wednesday night because me and my friends were craving ramen. It was our first visit and the restaurant wasn't too busy so we were able to be seated immediately. Our server was very nice and gave helpful suggestions since we weren't sure what to order. Okonomiyaki Fries: 5/5Really good! I loved the crisp ones of the fries and I loved the toppings and sauce they pair with it. A really good appetizer to split with your table. Gyoza Ramen: 4/5Really filling and I like how they put a lot of noodles! I actually had leftovers that I took home because the bowl was much larger than expected. I thought the gyoza was just okay, but the broth and noodles were pretty good. Pink Lemonade: 5/5Exactly what you'd expect it to taste like, no complaints here!Overall, had a pretty good time here and the service was really good as well. Would recommend!\", 'What we ordered for 2:Sizzling Bibimbap - we got it with bulgogi and it tasted delicious. Chicken Jjim - we got the soy garlic chicken with cheese and the cheese made it extra good! must get the cheese, it elevates the dish. Service here was friendly and filled our cups of water whenever it was empty.', \"I love Jijime, it's probably one of my favorite korean spots in the city! The place is cozy and perfect for both small and large parties. They take reservations so that's a plus. I love the fact that there are so many appetizers and fun bites to choose from. The boneless fried chicken is a must try (all the flavors are quite delicious), so crispy and flavorful. I was also surprised by how well made their ramen was. Super rich and creamy broth, generous portions, and fresh ingredients.Service is super fast, and such a fun restaurant to visit with friends!\", \"I came here on a Friday night with a friend and saw a group of people waiting outside. We didn't have a reservation and worried it would be a long wait. Luckily, we put our names down and were called in about 20 mins! So don't be discouraged about walking in at a popular time.We ordered the potato croquette to share and I got myself the bugolgi bowl. The croquettes were delicious and I would highly recommend them. The bugolgi came with yummy glass noodles and was fresh and hot. The portion was generous, and I made a second meal out of the leftovers.I really want to come back here with a group and try all their tapas because everything looked super good!\", \"I went here on a Saturday around 4:30pm and there was no wait. Anyways, we were quickly seated so I guess that's good.We ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen, Bimbimbap Bowl, and Okonomiyaki Fries. Once our food came, we took some pictures of it, but it felt like the waitress didn't want us to take pictures of the food. I didn't like how the waitress rushed us since that made me feel a bit uncomfortable.Now, about the food! I really enjoyed the Okonomiyaki Fries and it was fun watching the flakes move when it first arrived. The fries also had some type of sauce on it and wasn't too soggy. The Tonkotsu Ramen was good too and I liked how chewy the noodles were. I also tried the Bimbimbap Bowl and loved how much meat and flavor it had! I'm usually not someone who orders bimbimbap bowls because everything gets mixed together, but that one tasted good.I'd recommend this place, but maybe don't take pictures of your food here when it's almost dinner time. All the food tasted good, but the service wasn't that great when I was here.\", 'Got the fries, popcorn salmon, curry croquettes, and sizzling tofu bibimbap. Fries and popcorn salmon were fantastic, highly recommend. Curry croquettes were tasty, but felt a bit pricy for what you got. Bibimbap was good, and the house made sauce was really wonderful. I do think this spot is, like all spots, struggling with \"shrinkflation\" so do be aware as you order as portions for some things feel small. Not a ding on the restaurant as this is happening to all of us.Service was fast and friendly! The restaurant is a great size--there\\'s enough room but it\\'s not so big as to feel loud or lose the sense of being an \"intimate\" venue.', \"Loved this place! Great vibe. Not too pricey. Ordered:Pork belly salad - enjoyable, unique but thought kimchi overpowered the pork belly, so i couldn't tell if pork belly had much flavor. i think there was a hint of sweetness somewhere which would have been nice to taste more of.Popcorn salmon - YUM. could have been slightly more juicy but it's fried salmon so i think that would be hardChicken jjim (spicy) - YUMM. it was v good. Perfect for 2 people. chicken juicy. flavor good. adding cheese was the right move.Would come again!...food - 4/5 (creative, fresh, yum)service - 5/5ambiance - 4/5value - 4/5\", 'Very cute and cozy Korean restaurant. After a visit to the Legion of Honor, boyfriend and I came here for lunch, and thankfully seated immediately. For appetizers, we got karaage, which was good. My boyfriend got a soup and a bowl of rice. I love hot stone bibimbap, so I ordered a sizzling chicken bibimbap. I had requested brown rice when I put in my order, and they forgot my request and brought me white rice. They were nice to swap it out immediately. For dessert, we enjoyed the mango panna cotta. Very filling, and a nice little gem.', \"Good food and friendly staff.The standout dish for me was the popcorn salmon. Very crispy and flavorful. The sauce that it came with was delicious as well.The Okonomiyaki fries were unique and tasty. The Tonkotsu Sesame ramen was good but not great. I wouldn't come back here for the ramen but it was a nice meal on a cold SF day.Overall really enjoyed my experience here!\", \"I went to Jijime for a quick & casual dinner with a friend and loveddd what I got -- corn cheese, takoyaki, and spicy boneless chicken wings! The food came very quickly after ordering and every bite was delicious.The corn cheese was on a sizzling platter and oozing with cheese, the takoyaki was so crunchy on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside, and the chicken wings were crispy, spicy, and well seasoned. I'm definitely going to go back to try more of their other plates, but I was very pleased with these three small bite items!\", \"Came by during dinnertime with friends on a weekday, and the restaurant wasn't too packed; we were seated right away. We ordered for the table okonomiyaki fries and the boneless soy garlic fried chicken. The fried chicken was moist and crispy, and I daresay its better than Bonchons! The fries were also crisp and not too salty, and the okonomiyaki toppings were unique and very flavorful.I got the Kuro ramen, which was rich and creamy as advertised, and overall it was pretty good ramen! Will definitely come by again sometime and try the other dishes~\", \"We decided to take others to Jijime since we had such a good meal the last time.  Service here is pretty attentive.  Most of the time, our water glasses were filled.  Though the water was tap and not filtered.   Food came out in a timely manner.  Appetizers first and then all the entrees came out at once which was good.    I'd have to take off a star because my entree was disappointing.  Maybe I should have stuck with my usual kuro ramen.  I had the sizzling bibimbap and they put lettuce as a veggie, which barely has substance and it was spread out on a sizzling pan but lettuce shouldn't be on a sizzling pan?  That would only make the lettuce wilt.  Bibimbap usually has tons of veggies like zucchini, cabbage, carrots, onions, spinach, bean sprouts, and one portion of meat and an egg on top.  This isn't your typical bibimbap, so if you're expecting traditional, I wouldn't order this.  I got a bit of carrots, onions, a few slivers of zucchini and bean sprouts.  The rice was crispy on the bottom as you would expect, but that was the only thing that was decent about this dish.  The chicken was chopped up into little bits which didn't amount to much either.  For the price paid, I would have expected more.  I should have gone with the regular bibimbap which wasn't sizzling.  Honestly, I want more vegetables.  Others in our party had tonkatsu ramen, short ribs, takoyaki, chicken kaarage, and the spicy pork plate.  We also ordered a couple of ACE pineapple ciders.  Crisp and refreshing as ciders should be!  The ramen, short ribs and takoyaki were good, but the chicken kaarage was dry since they used chicken breast.  Maybe chicken thigh meat would have been a better option for this.  The spicy pork had more clear noodles and vegetables than there was meat.  Here's the breakdown and rating for each:Sizzling bibimbap with soy garlic chicken  2/5Tonkatsu ramen  4/5Short ribs 4/5Spicy Pork  3/5Chicken Kaarage 3/5Takoyaki 4/5Pineapple cider 5/5I think if we were to come back, I'd order the items I know and like rather than try something new.\", 'Went here for dinner. Street parking only. They had a happy hour for some of the drinks. And we got some appetizers (fries and corn) and the main dish was Spicy CK JJIM. It was pretty good, it definitely had a kick of spice. Would recommend', \"Was craving ramen after a night out and stopped by here to try their ramen. Interior is really cute and very chill vibes with jazz music playing in the background. Service was average but our server was attentive with refilling water. Kiage Tempura (not pictured): This was a veggie tempura fried in a way that it resembles a scallion/kimchi pancake. Very unique. The tempura crunch was nice and fluffy. The dish overall didn't feel like it was oily or heavily fried. 4.5/5Kuro Ramen: Broth was very rich and possibly a little too decadent after a few sips. Not as garlicky as i expected with the black garlic oil but the garlic flavor was present. Noodles were very average and kinda look like they were instant noodles. Chashu was good with a nice sear. 3.5/5Tonkatsu Ramen: Same as the Kuro ramen, except no garlic and was a little creamier. Both were medium but the tonkatsu one felt spicier. 3.\", \"Ramen was delicious!! (I was a bit sad they wouldn't let me exchange the pork for the Goyza but ah well). Quick nice service. Would definitely recommend. There were several items that looked good that I would check out.\", \"Amazing mouthwatering food! We arrived on a weekend night and waited around 20 minutes outside for our table. The chicken Jjim with cheese was incredible, the table next to us even asked about it. I also LOVED the corn cheese. Every dish was packed with flavor and was a feast for both the stomach and eyes. The only thing was that our order did get messed up and we received one wrong dish but the kitchen closed and we weren't able to get the one we ordered.\", \"TLDR: nice hot ramen in a nice little restaurant with good service--My fiancé and I came here for dinner one day during the week after work. Surprisingly it was almost full around 5pm on a Wednesday! Luckily we got there early and didn't need reservation. However on a busy weekend, I would probably expect to wait for a table..I got the Kuro Ramen which is basically their tonkotsu with black garlic oil. If you like garlic and a bit more flavor, definitely go with this one and it doesn't cost any extra! The egg was runny, as a soft boiled should be, and the broth was nice and hot on the super cold day. The only thing that wasn't spot on was the chashu. It tasted good, but the texture was tough and seemed almost dry. The service staff was super nice and attentive and I have no complaints here. The restrooms were not very clean, so be prepared. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place to friends and family, but there are also a lot of other great ramen restaurants in the city. Some other places even allow you to choose the firmness of your noodles! If you're in this area and looking for a hot bowl of ramen, this is an easy choice.\", \"This place wins the award for the worst tofu stew I've ever had. I was craving tofu stew when I met up with a friend to dine here. Despite the fact that this place is known for other dishes, I still went ahead and ordered a tofu stew because I was simply craving it. Wow what a mistake! I ordered a pork tofu stew with medium spice. There were barely any tiny pieces of pork, and the small broken apart pieces of tofu looked like they were leftovers from something else. Meanwhile the stew was very watered down, lacked flavor, was not spicy at all, and was so lukewarm that it did not taste fresh. The tofu stew also had tons of cooked white onions in it as a cheap filler ingredient to make up for the lack of pork and tofu. In line with this cost cutting approach, I was not surprised that this restaurant doesn't serve any banchan either.Additionally, as someone with a green onion allergy, I was disappointed to see tons of green onions in the stew despite no mention of it on the menu. Had the menu description been accurate, I would've been able to ask for no green onions ahead of time. Instead, I spent 5 minutes picking each piece out myself. I highly recommend the restaurant to update its menu to help out customers with certain food allergies/intolerances.\", \"I have tried everything on the menu and I am OBSESSED with this place. My go to everything I visit San Fran. It's also next to a beautiful flower shop. It is a smaller restaurant but we've never had a problem getting a table. The happy hour is a good deal for sake. Beef Bibimbap 10/10, very large and enough for 3 people to share. Boneless Fried Chicken - garlic flavor is the amazing. Very crispy and not too much fried skin on the outside. Pork Buns if I could eat them everyday I would holy yummy. The bun is nice and fluffy with a good flavor with the cucumber and dice. We also always order the corn and dried ikea legs. Hands down I love this place and would take anyone here!!\", 'Interesting food concept Korean Asian fusion and they advertise as such & I\\'m not sure what that is exactly. Scanning the menu, it\\'s predominately Korean with a sprinkling of Japanese and maybe some Chinese influence.The most \"innovative\" dish offering was  a sizzling bibimbap--kind of gimmicky at $20, if you ask me. Bibimbap in a hot dolsot is already crispy and sizzling. Here it\\'s served on a larger scale flat sizzling skillet and you get to mix it up like you would a teppan rice platter, so what makes it fusion? The chicken jjim was sweet and smothered in cheese.  The curry korokke were 2 heart shaped pieces (for $7.50), cut in half--so it looks like you got more than you actually did. It was grease free, crispy and tasty, although the ranch dipping sauce was interesting. We also ordered the boneless fried chicken--it was 3 party wings.  The ramen in tonkotsu broth was nothing outstanding to callout.I\\'m not sure why they call themselves Asian fusion--it seems like a restaurant that doesn\\'tknow what to serve--as they serve a mix of Korean, Japanese and a few Chinese dishes and being able to order in a 1-stop shop, I would not consider it fusion.I didn\\'t think it was worth the long wait--for what amounts to a nothingburger.', \"Came here on a cold winter night, our group wanted comfort, hearty and simple. JIJIME had a great ambiance, looked very modern, menu was a fusion of Korean and Japanese. We got lots of appetizers for our group of 4 to share. The corn cheese tasted burnt on it's hot plate. Either than that, the rest of the food was flavorful. Loved the curry croquettes, popcorn salmon & the fried octopus legs. I always get bulgogi anytime I go to a Korean restaurant. My bulgogi bowl did not disappoint. The sizzling bibimbap with it's colorful presentation was delicious! My friend who who doesn't eat meat got the seafood/veggie ramen and said was really good. This is a great place to go to fill your bellies with very reasonable prices. Great for groups or dates! 4 stars!\", 'I stumbled across this restaurant after getting some plants nearby. It was almost empty when I stopped by and it was happy hour. They had $3 sake which was good. The server was very attentive and checked on me often. I had the chicken jjim with cheese. It was very flavorful and I enjoyed it. It was big enough for me to have leftovers which is always a plus! I will be returning to try their small plates.', 'Came here for a late lunch. I was greeted and seated immediately. I got the tonkatsu ramen. It came out fairly quickly and piping hot.It was very filling with lots of noodles, a soft boiled egg, some greens, and 2 slices of pork belly. The ramen and broth had a bit of a powdery feel to it, but nothing too egregious.Service was quick and the bathrooms were also clean. I would come back again.']\n",

      "Reviews: [\"Food and drinks are absolutely amazing. Service is lacking. Last time I went, after driving two hours and waiting 30 for a drink. The new server finally took our appetizer order. That was the only time we saw him all night. As the kitchen closed he asked if we were ready for the bill. That was the worst service we've ever had. But the food is great!!!!\", \"This will be a regular dining venue.  Our party had 4 different pastas. Saffron risotto ossobuco , risotto frutti  di Mara. We're excellent.  I had the rotolo which was really unique, a rolled pasta with braised rabbit bechamel and fontina just amazing. Cocktails: golden thread was similar to a  old fashion but lighter., Martinis really nice.  Gelato: Sicilian pistachio and pomegranate sorbettto had great texture and had vibrant flavornice to end the meal with.  Oh the homemade foccacia was really special, a different take than normal.  Can't wait to come back.\", \"Went here for brunch the other day and overall had a decent time! The service was nice and the venue is cute and centrally located.The polenta braise was really yummy and felt like it was good bang for your buck. It was creamy and savory, but I felt like I needed one more piece of focaccia to really soak it up.The burrata was a real rip off though. For $17, we expected to get like a whole chunk of burrata with bread and persimmon/candied walnuts on it. However, we literally got one piece of toast with a small smear of burrata. This didn't feel worth the price point at all. I did feel a bit mislead because I asked about portion sizes and was led to believe the burrata would be filling for 2 people which was just not true.Ultimately, I'd go back and try to order a different appetizer or I'd try dinner.\", \"Tldr; cold and salty food combined with subpar service. Ideally, I'd give this place a 2.5, but I can't justify rounding up.  The Tailor's Son provides both indoor and outdoor dining experiences. The restaurant's ambiance is undeniably chic, with stylish décor and a lively atmosphere. Unfortunately, when you make a reservation, you can't provide your seating preference. I made a reservation weeks ahead of time, only to be informed by the restaurant on the day of our reservation that they'll be seating us outside (in late November). Their outdoor space is covered and has heaters on the ceiling, but it's not as effective. We were fine, but I wish they had provided more info about our dinner reservation earlier. There were 3 of us, so we tried a few items from their menu. There were 2 things that were consistent about every dish that we tried - they were all (including the desserts) too salty and were served lukewarm or cold.We ordered- **Appetizers**1. House foccasia2. Carne cruda3. Mondeghili4. Prosciutto di parma**Mains**1. Agnolotti del pin2. Rotolo**Desserts**1. Budino2. Apple crostataThe bread in the foccasia and the crostini was dry. Meatballs in mondeghili were light but salty. The gnocco frittos in prosciutto di parma were a bit doughy. The sauce for the agnolotti del pin was very watery, so it wouldn't stick to the pasta. Again, it was too salty as well. And the pasta was undercooked. Apple crostata was okay. Both the whipped cream and the ice cream were salty. The ice cream was also very rich and dense. The service was all over the place. Our server did a great job explaining the menu and walking us through the popular dishes, but after that, we struggled to get the attention of the staff whether it was for getting water refilled, or asking for a menu/check. They were just slamming dishes on our table and leaving so fast that we couldn't even get a word out to get their attention. I wonder if that's because we were seated outside and there was a lot going on inside.Anyway, we gave this place a try and most likely won't be back.\", 'Came in with a reservation for a party of 3 on a Friday at 5:15pm, and were seated immediately.The interior is super cute! I love the peaceful green color all along the walls and tables. Gives off a very welcoming yet clean and chic feel.Here is everything we ordered:Crudo Di Tonno - the fish tasted a bit stale for us, gives kind of a very \"fishy\" flavor in the not-so-fresh way. I liked the grapefruit, I thought it added a nice bright acidity. Also, this dish is spicy! I\\'m not sure how the table felt about it, it\\'s an interesting touch.Toscana - my personal favorite shareable crostini for the table. You don\\'t get too much, but I liked what I got. The sweetness from the marmellata goes with the umami from the paté very well. Yum!Baccala Mantecato - salted cod, a good tummy filler.Spaghettini Nero - good, as expected. The shrimp pieces are well-seasoned, and the pasta is al-dente.Agnolotti del Plin - another good tummy filler, I think of these like veal and pork dumplings with cheese and some sauce. I liked it!With drinks and a good group of friends I think you\\'d have a fun time at The Tailor\\'s Son! The ambience is lively and welcoming, and my group had a really good time. The food was some-good and some-misses, but nothing detracted from the enjoyment of our night. I\\'d say give them a shot if you\\'re in the area and are craving some Italian!', \"This restaurant has been on my list for a while and I'm glad to finally try it. The interior was very cute and great for date night, girls night, or a small group dinner. They also had plenty of outdoor seating.We had a reservation for a weekend dinner and got seated immediately when arrived. The two of us ordered two appetizers and two pastas to share. There were some unique flavour combos such as the persimmon and burrata, and duck leg pasta and everything was executed perfectly. It was a good amount of food for two girls and we enjoyed people watching while eating.They have a pretty long wine list but I wanted to try a cocktail so I ordered the one with matcha foam (can't remember the name). It wasn't spirit-forward but delicious nevertheless.\", \"Busy restaurant! Rezzies highly encouraged. They have a good happy hour too until 7pm weekdays but at the bar only. Lots of Italian influenced options. Octopus was fresh and so was burrata. Enjoyed the squid ink pasta too.Nice indoor space with open concept kitchen. Can't complain about the service, polished and professional. Hard to park as it's on a very busy street.\", \"Wonderful! Food was great. Lovely menu. Service was kinda weird. Hostess came on strong and then our waiter never checked back in between us ordering our food and getting the back. I enjoyed the setup of the restaurant as well as the overall ambiance. I'll likely be back for the food!\", \"Brunch at The Tailor's Son was a real treat. Whenever we are visiting SF our son manages to take us to  some really good restaurants. He does not believe in taking us to the same place twice (exception being breweries and bars).Daniel opted for the Italian 75 while I enjoyed my Chef's Breakfast - not your normal Bloody Mary. We both ordered the Polenta Braise (Pork Ragu, Poached Eggs, Polenta and Foccaccia) with the Pomodoro (Baked Eggs, San Marzano Tomatoes, Pancetta and Crostini). Everything was terrific and the place was quite busy. Try it - you will like it!\", \"I love tailors son on Fillmore! We came on a Thursday for Theo happy hour and were pleasantly surprised! Their pizzas are different and unique- they remind me of a thin scallion pancake with toppings vs the traditional pizza with fluffy crust you might be used to. Regardless the ingredients for the toppings are top tier and delicious. We ordered the cannoleni pasta and saffron risotto with bone marrow on the regular menu and had no regrets! The saffron pasta was unique and creamy, and the cannoleni was warm and luscious. I'll definitely come back!\", \"I've been wanting to check out this restaurant for a while, such a good place for brunch and dinner. The interior is really pretty and laid back. We arrived at the restaurant at 4ish and they told us to wait in the bar until the tables available for dinner. Calamari: a perfect fried appetizer. It was crispy and the aioli was so good. Bucatini: Amazing! The tomato sauce is tangy, the pasta is cooked al dente and everything was just really well balanced. I'd love the guanchale to be a bit crispier but that's just a personal preference. Spaghettini: Interesting flavor. There's some spice to it and my friend enjoyed the dish a lot!  Overall we had a good time. Great food and great ambiance. I'd love the portion to be bigger, though.\", \"Really cute, modern, clean, and sleek interior. The ambience is chic with its high ceilings! The food blew us away. Something as simple as deviled eggs were sooooo packed with flavor & yummy. All of their pizzas were yummy, especially the mushroom one, which we got twice!Their cocktails are spirit forward, well balanced, and nice & strong. Tailor's son is our favorite, and we can't wait to bring some out of town visitors we have coming soon!\", \"Had a reservation for 2 for 7:30p on a Wednesday and were seated immediately. All the other tables were full and there was an air of energy everywhere. Definitely a great place for a date night or a fun night with friends.We had a hard time picking from the menu since everything looked delicious. We ended up going with:TOSCANA- 5/5 the duck liver was SO creamy like a lil bite of heaven. My picture doesn't do it justice.BUCATINI ALL'AMATRICIANA- 5/5 fresh pasta, delicious sauce. A classicAL GAMBERI RISOTTO- 4/5 didn't enjoy this one as much as the other two but still solid! Shrimp and risotto were nicely balancedESPRESSO MARTINIS- 4/5 smells delicious, goes down smoothly\", 'Humm.. I want to give this place a better review but I think given how competitive the SF dining scene is when it is also located at the heart of Filmore, Tailor\\'s son is at best \"average,\" which I\\'d argue a 3.5 star equivalent. We ordered a cocktail, of a name I can\\'t even remeber because it was so diluted with water/ice that I couldn\\'t tasted really any alcohol or flavor. I didn\\'t think it was any good.For starters, we had an anchovy little gem salad (4/5), Caprese (5/5), and the shrimp risotto/ Al Gamberi (3/5), and the Agnolotti Del Plin (3/5). The main issue of the food I believe is the seasoning, dressing, and the sauces. For the shrimp risotto, the rice was very well-done with lack of seasoning. The shrimp was alright but the rice had nothing to do in terms of pairing with the shrimp. The pasta, was a very contemporary version of the original Agnolotti Del Plin, which was like tiny Italian dumpling with filling of roasted meat (pork/veal). However, this restaurant made it in a new form in terms of the dough, but also failed on the creamy sauce that had the past sat in. It was lack of salt or literally any flavor to it. i\\'m not saying this place is bad, or to avoid completely.. I\\'m only saying you probably have better options if craving Italian food.', 'Cute outdoor seating in fillmore. Dog friendly. Pretty small menu and portions, but everything was generally tasty. Service was good, all the servers were nice.  Even gave the dogs water and some oyster crackers as a snack.  The little gem salad was refreshing, egg cooked perfectly. The duck pate was a little salty nevertheless tasty. We took a stroll to the Lyon Steps after brunch. Nice walk and fancy home viewing.', 'I\\'ve dined here twice so far and enjoyed everything I\\'ve eaten. My most recent experience was a \"treat yo self\" day.  I got a glass of rosé, the mushroom risotto, and the lemon olive oil cake. The mushroom risotto was so good!  It lives up to the hype imo.  The rice was cooked perfectly and it was full of mushroom flavor.  It was a good portion, too. I was full, but I needed to get a dessert to round out all that savory goodness.  Eating the lemon olive oil cake was love at first bite!  It was so delicious!  The cake was moist and full of lemon flavor. It also came with a scoop of lemon gelato, which added bit of tartness.  I\\'m more of a chocolate person, and they do have a chocolate dessert on the menu.  But I highly recommend the lemon olive oil cake, which will be my go-to dessert the next time I dine here. Service was friendly and I got my food pretty quickly.  The restaurant has a good space for both small and large parties.  The last time I was here, they had a parklet but I don\\'t know if it\\'s still there considering the city\\'s new rules.  Because it\\'s spacious inside, the acoustics aren\\'t that great.  It can get really noisy.  I want to come back here for happy hour. It gets really busy around that time. If you want a table, definitely make a reservation. If you\\'re there for happy hour, the bar seating is first come first serve.', \"I wanted to try tailors son..his parents were tailors  in Italy..he became a chef..I got there on a Friday during happy hour..wanted to try so called pizza and calamari..I tried to the happy hour pizza with funghi and I didn't like it..it had a strange white sauce and some mushrooms with crispy bread ..I didn't eat most of it..calamari whatever.. overpriced and not sure about this kind of Italian food..fun tailor outfits ..if u like drinking ...on Fillmore Pacific heights\", 'Great spot! Yummy drinks and great flavors for their brunch. Personally, felt like their portions were too rather small compared to other brunch spots but if you want a light plate to not feel too full, this is is it.Charming indoor decor and great outdoor patio!', \"Date of Visit: 5/13/2023There are many decent Italian restaurants opening up in San Francisco recently. We visited The Tailor's Son located on Fillmore Street on Mother's Day weekend. They just opened for about 2 years by Adriano Paganini, who was born and raised in Milan. Adriano Paganini's mother was an exceptional cook, and many of the dishes on our menu were inspired by meals she prepared for her family.We made a reservation beforehand for Saturday noon, and it was about 80% full in the restaurant when we arrived. I think walk-ins will be fine at the time.There are some light cocktails and brunch selection during the weekend lunch hours. Bramble Berry Spritz $13I got the berry cocktail with vermouth and prosecco based, with house blackberry shrub, lemon and seltzer mixed. Highway of the Sun $14I also like Highway of the Sun, which is an aperol, gin and carpano bianco based. And there was a slice of orange on top of the ice cubes. Sprezzatura $14My friend got the Sprezzatura, which is a vodka based cocktail, with peach, pineapple, lemon, mint, and sparkling moscato. The taste was fairly light. Espresso Martini $14Espresso martini is more on the sweeter side. House Focaccia $5We got the house made focaccia as a starter. With rosemary, sea salt and olive oil on top. Uova Alla San Benedettina $18This is similar to egg benedict. With prosciutto cotto, poached eggs, parmesan crème on top of the focaccia. Spaghetti Carbonara $18We got two orders of spaghetti carbonara. The spaghetti was chewy with egg yolk and pancetta, which is a good brunch selection. Panini $16One of our friends got the panini, and inside are mortadella, prosciutto cotto, and salame.Bomboloni $9Highly recommend the bomboloni! With strawberry jam on the side. it was not too sweet but tasty! Definitely a good add on or dessert during the brunch hours. Side Fruit $5We ordered side fruit to pair with our brunch. It has strawberry, blood orange, orange, kiwi, and blueberry Gelato $7The Fior di Latte gelato was a little too sweet on a warm afternoon.\", \"I've been here twice (on week nights) and both times have been a great experience.

Food was delicious (somewhat small portions) with great cocktails. Service: 4/5Food and drink: 5/5Atmosphere: 5/5Overall: 4.5/5\", 'I arrived for dinner hungry and was not disappointed. I showed up around 8:45 on a Saturday night and it was still very lively.The star of the night was the Al Gamberi, which was creamy and savory. I also liked the other plates we ordered - the Agnolotti Del Plin was beefy and cheesy, and the Toscana crostini was sweet and savory with the pâté and compote (although I wish the pâté had a stronger flavor). Our server was attentive and prompt. However, I think there was a bit of confusion towards the end because we had our plates taken away before the Agnolotti Del Plin arrived and we had to check in on our order. After doing so though, the server was apologetic and gave us clean plates and utensils. Overall, I would return to see what happy hour is like and try the other menu options! :)', \"a fun dinner spot in Fillmore/Pac Heights! it's super lively and does get busy -- we luckily snagged an outdoor booth, but it was still cozy with heaters and intimate lighting.I thought the food itself was good, not terrific; you can definitely find food of similar quality at a lower price elsewhere in the city. I did love the burrata crostini though -- super fresh olive oil and burrata, and the asparagus was a welcome burst of flavor & texture.  overall, a bit expensive for what you get, but worthwhile for a date night / dinner out with friends!\", 'My Italian friend and I loved this place.  We were happy to go to a place with homemade pasta.  Our waitress was sweet, professional and knowledgable.  She introduced us to Sformato, which she described as a spinach flan, but I think it was more like a fine quiche.  It was so delicious with the toasted hazelnuts!  They also had a unique cucumber lemonade type drink. I appreciated when our waitress asked if we had dietary restrictions, so I could request the drink to be low in sugar; the drink was unique, tasty and refreshing.  The two pasta dishes we got, Bucatini and Rigatoncini, were both delicious, albeit a bit similar to each other, both being a touch spicy. My friend got cannolis for dessert and I tasted them-- deliciously light and lemony cream!  We got there early and the place soon filled up with a lively crowd.  I would totally go back again.  A recommendation to the management: some of the tines of the forks were uneven.  When there is time, perhaps these could be straightened out.', \"A night out of town consists of two things: good food and good company. I was lucky to have both on this night. Let's focus on the food. My friend had moved from Dallas to Santa Rosa and had heard about so many good things regarding The Tailor's Son.We finally decided to try the place during an overnight trip to the city. Before heading out to our concert, we decided to grab a bite at The Tailor's Son after scouting the menu and deciding that the items would fill us up. We ordered a few appetizers and main dishes (the pasta was so fulfilling). We left very happy. The place gets super packed with people. Luckily we were able to grab seats at the bar and enjoy the view with the mirrors reflection. Our bartender paid us as much attention as he could as we were hidden behind one of the bar dispensers. The food was prompt so that made up for the delay on drinks and water refills. The area really is lovely and we highly suggest the area and The Tailor's Son. Walkable distance from many night life events but if you prefer grabbing a ride, no shame in it, especially when it's cold out.\", \"Super excited to try out this spot! I got the Agnolotti Del Plin. The pasta had a nice essence of parmigiano reggiano. There is nice comfortable interior decor with outdoor parklet seating. My party sat outside, and it was a little difficult to fet the waiter's attention at times but not terrible. I'd definitely be interested in checking out other menu items.\", \"The menu looks so fun there are food I haven't heard of in other Italian restaurants. We got the sformato which the waitress explained to us to be a spinach savory flan. I love the texture it's kind of spongy and very creamy and delicious. For dessert we got the olive oil cake. The outside crust was sweet and slightly crunchy and paired so well with the vanilla ice cream on the side. For the pasta I got the ragatoncini which was great although not super memorable for me personally. Waiter is attentive and friendly despite it being pretty busy on a Thursday evening. There are some outdoor seating and a lot of indoor seating but it was pretty full so definitely make a reservation before coming.\", \"A good Italian restaurant is hard to come by, in my frank opinion. But The Tailor's Son just knocks it out of the park and squashes and preconceived notions I had about Italian restaurants. This establishment has extremely flavorful food that stays true to it's Italian roots but adds an almost New America twist. You HAVE to get the Burrata Crostini. All the reviews here are not lying. The star of the dish IS THE BREAD. So warm, soft and crispy that holds the creamy burrata perfectly. The pickled green tomatoes and asparagus add the perfect texture and acidity all well rounded dishes have. For our mains, we order the Agnolotti and Risotto Alla Milanese. BOTH EQUALLY AS SCRUMPTIOUS. The agnolotti bursts with flavor and is coated is a light but flavorful sauce. Finally, the risotto. How would I describe it? Creamy. Al dente. And a solid dish of risotto. Is super unique? No. But is it full of flavor and meshes perfectly with the ossobucco? Yes!So what about the ambiance and service? I'll be honest...it's a bit loud in here. I could still hear my friend talking across from me (albeit with a bit of shouting) but this is not one of the establishments you come for an intimate dinner. It's definitely a vibe. Service was excellent as well. It was the right balance of making sure we had everything we needed but not being overbearing. I loved how we could pay via Apple Pay at the end and didn't have to wait for the waiter to swipe our card. Five stars all around!\", \"Definitely an amazing restaurant! Excellent Italian food, the quality was beyond great! The place was so cool, nice seating and has a lovely atmosphere. The servers were prompt and accommodating. The pastas were so  amazing, nice flavors and has great texture. The Agnolotti Del Plin has a creamy flavors. The Burrata Crostini was delicious. The dessert was fantastic. I can't recommend the food enough, it was so great.  Drinks were so cool!\", \"I really love this place. Every time I have friends visiting town, I make sure to take them here. It's great for medium and small groups, and the overall atmosphere is fun and elegant. Both the indoor and outdoor seating is great, especially since it's in such a lively location.The cocktails are delicious - my favorite is the sprezzatura. I don't think I've gone here once without ordering it. Their small veggie places are all amazing - I especially loved the artichokes. The risottos are also a go to, and big enough for 2 to share.\", 'The food was excellent. Quality Italian fare and packed with flavor. The highlight was definitely the CANNELLONI. The cheesecake was light and refreshing.Price: $$Overall: 9.5/10Must get cannelloni', \"Would come here again for the cocktails - we ordered the suit makers sour and it was the most delicious cocktail I ever had! It's also a beautiful drink and the foam on top reminded me of latte art.The agnolotti was also good although it was slightly chewier than I expected - I think if you are not very hungry you could split it with someone.The vibes were also good and the service was great! The waiter we had was new but they were very attentive and overall it was a pleasant experience.\", 'The bar is the best. Great ambiance, excellent food. Open relatively late as well. For a San Francisco water, that is.', \"Great ambiance but the vibe from some of the staff comes off as a bit snooty? Can't really explain how but that's the vibe I get. I've tried:- Calamari (small portion)- Napoletana pizza fritta - Salami pizza fritta (don't get this, super dry and not much flavor)- Bucatini all amatriciana- Cocktails: with Prosecco, Negroni alpino, sprezzaturaOf all these I would recommend the Napoletana, bucatini, and sprezzatura!\", 'Indulge in a delightful evening combining pasta and cocktails.This restaurant takes a hipster approach to classic Italian recipes, drawing in crowds with its vibrant and bustling atmosphere. Their minimalist style complements the top-notch flavors they offer, using only the freshest ingredients. Once they\\'re out, they\\'re out--there\\'s no unlimited \"soup, salad & breadsticks\" here like at some other places.I can personally attest to the risotto and cocktails, a fantastic combination. The carne cruda (tartare toast) also deserves high praise. It was absolutely delicious.', \"Visited for a Friday night date.While not my top choice for Italian cuisine in the city, it's a good pick if you're planning to hang around this neighborhood and hit some bars afterward. The food was tasty but didn't amaze us. Service was efficient even on a seemingly bustling night.They offer a great deal of outdoor seating, which we really appreciated.\", \"Man listen if you need a nice smooth Italian cuisine date this one of them ones food was amazing the wine was good. They know exactly what their doing I'll be back.\", \"Really cute restaurant but overall not the greatest experience. We went for an outdoor brunch over the weekend and ordered the polenta and bucatini. The polenta was a bit bland, but the bucatini was just UNBELIEVABLY salty. The seasoning of both dishes was off and made the food a bit disappointing for me. The service was fine, but nothing spectacular. Might try visiting for dinner another time to see if it's better!\", \"I've been really excited to try this place because each time I walk by, I always do a double take at the stunning interior! The place was absolutely packed on Saturday night. My bf and I came here for our anniversary, and they seated us at a two seater tucked away by the bar. It was lovely and secluded from the crowd. Overall ambiance is very lively yet intimate. Service is pretty good! Our server was really attentive. However, the food came out really slowly and at awkward times. We were already done with our apps for 20 minutes and the entrees were still not delivered. Food was good, but the favorite was the agnolotti pasta. It was creamy, savory, and portions were generous. Wish the sauce had more flavor though. The tuna carpaccio was ok, nothing extraordinary but the fish was fresh. The mushroom risotto was fab - a ton of mushroom, literally 2-3 with every bite. Creamy, warm, and comforting. The crostini was ok, i was not a fan of the jalapenos and bread was slightly too hard.  Overall, solid place to try for the unique ambiance, but for the price point you can find better Italian food in the city!\", \"We stopped in for early Sunday dinner on the last day of the Fillmore Jazz. Busy and most tables filled, thank goodness for Yelp reservations.I dug the several takes on the stalwart Negroni, and will continue to explore their take if we visit again. But one thing that's a minor peeve (and the reason for one star off), is if you're going to offer swordfish, don't overcook it. Dry, flavorless - meh. My wife's pasta entree was quite tasty, and to be fair the accompanying vegetables with my swordfish were wonderfully complex and bursting with flavors. Will we return? There are lots of unexplored options on Fillmore for our next visit. Service was attentive, professional, and timely given the post-festival crush, and we may give The Tailor's Son another try in the near.\", \"I stopped by for lunch on a Sunday and was able to get a table right away! I tried the polenta braise - I LOVE polenta but it's usually hard to find on menus, so I'm glad they serve it here. The polenta was creamy and complemented by pork ragu. The poached eggs were a bit overcooked and too well-done for my liking, but the focaccia was so good - I only wish there was more of it. The interior is beautiful and there is ample outdoor seating. I'll be back to try their dinner menu!\"]\n",

      "Reviews: ['The best restaurant in San Francisco. Cook knows his job   and he is so talented. Everything is amazing. Foods are amazing that took me to İstanbul.', \"Bistro Ember is one of our new favorite neighborhood spots. Every single dish totally blew us away and you can tell the chef put a lot of thought into the detail and presentation of each plate. We started with amazing fried chickpea bread served w/butter stunningly shaped as a honeycomb. The Manti Dumplings were filled with a savory lamb and beef mixture and served in a rich, oak-smoked yogurt sauce, and the Turkish Tagliatelle was tossed w/tender grilled chicken and a nutty, fragrant antep pistachio pesto. The 12-hr Slow Cooked Lamb Shank was filled w/flavor and just melted off the bone. For dessert, our Turkish Coffee Cake was moist and chocolatey w/a coffee sauce poured over, and the Burnt Chicken Pudding was a delightful surprise - a rich & creamy pudding w/goat cheese ice cream, cinnamon crumble and topped with a candied piece of crispy chicken skin. The ambiance was so elegant and cozy w/warm, exposed brick walls. I definitely recommend this place looking for a nice dinner and can't wait to come back to try their weekend brunch.\", \"Absolutely delicious, elegant, and friendly here. There are so many great things to try on the brunch and dinner menus.Try the Traditional Turkish Breakfast!  The staff are extremely friendly and very good at walking you through the different items on the menu.The decor is lovely as well.   You feel like you are in an exclusive lounge. Can't wait to come back!\", \"My husband and I honeymooned in Turkey so we were SO excited to see Ember open near us, and decided to try it for our 15th anniversary dinner. In our reservation, we asked to be seated in a quieter area away from large parties. Unfortunately, when we arrived - it was midweek - we found the restaurant to be ear-splittingly loud. And we were offered a table by a party of 18 :-(  To their credit, the staff tried to accommodate us by offering a table farther away from the large party (if we were willing to wait 15 or 20 minutes) but it wasn't going to be much quieter there. We walked away sadly, and were lucky to find a table at a quieter restaurant in the neighborhood.  I wish the designers of Ember gave more thought to acoustics (I didn't see any of those sound panels on the ceiling for instance). Or maybe they want to discourage diners over 40?  The menu looks so interesting and the space is beautiful, so we hope to try it another time, as long as we don't have to shout to be heard.\", 'As you enter this establishment...in one of the quaintest neighborhoods in SF...a warm glowing fireplace greets you.  The restaurant style is cozy and stylish with great aesthetics.  The staff was superb with attentiveness.  The menu is small in choices but packed with delicious choices, flavors and tastes.  We enjoyed all our dishes...the bread was so yummy, the salads flavor-filled with freshness and brightness.  The entrees...the tagliatelle with grilled chicken, the fillet and the lamb shank...winning.  We tried two desserts...the chocolate cake with Turkish coffee a definite table pleaser.  We all are still raving over our meals.  Bravo!!!', \"Wow! What a gem in the Mission District that provides an upscale exploration into Turkish cuisine. I am guilty of not trying many Turkish dishes in the past, but after a night at Bistro Ember I am now sold. Aside from the rock star dishes, which I'll go more into detail in a bit, the service is stellar. As cliche as this may sound, you can feel the blood, sweat and tears put into the restaurant. Each worker has a huge smile and describes each dish with pride and passion. Most notably for our dessert course, the pastry chef came out to present the dish and had so much happiness as he was describing how to eat it. The staff definitely deserves five stars for providing such high level service. Now, to the part you are all here for: THE FOOD! Our personal favorites were the Turkish Tartare, Chickpea Yeast Bread, Lamb Mutancana and Chicken Pudding. Wow was that tartare packed with flavor. It was a mix of Kofte (Turkish meatball) and tenderloin. Man, I am not sure what spice was in the dish but it was so tasty. I could eat an entire plate on my own. Regarding the bread...it was so good! Fluffy, warm and paired exceptionally with the butter. It had great bounce and you couldn't even notice it was made out of chick peas. Now to the lamb...so tender paired with a smooth and luscious keskek (a Turkish risotto)! The sauce was silky and we licked every last bit of it up. Finally, the pudding. This was a perfect ending to our dinner! It had such a nutty flavor, and you couldn't even tell there was chicken in the dish at all. The goat cheese ice cream had an amazing tang that cut the savoriness of the pudding. Overall, amazing service and tasty dishes! You need to try this place out if you're in the mood for a Turkish meal.\", \"Every morsel and bite we had was delicious! We started with a cold appetizer: Fish and Raki. Raki is the national drink of Turkey and it's twice distilled grapes. It was light and perfect for summer.Then came the piping HOT yeast bread and our hot appetizer - the couscous. The couscous was my favorite dish because of the spring onion and basil purées that are incorporated into the dish.For a entrée, we had the Lamb Mutancana, which was tender, moist and flavorful. It is perhaps the most traditional Turkish dish on the menu but it was nice to have a traditional component to an otherwise very contemporary and innovative menu.Wait, we also had coffee and dessert! We couldn't resist trying the Burnt Chicken skin pudding. It was very unique and equally delicious.The service and the wait staff were perfect. There was ample parking outside on a Saturday night. The place is brand new and well turned out. It was quiet so we could hear each other talk, but it wasn't too quiet. We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and would go back again in a heartbeat.\", \"This review is for brunch only.  I had to make a last minute reservation change to increase our large party size, so I called and the restaurant was so accommodating!  They even were nice enough to let us push the time a bit.  This place has a good ambiance.  The omelets were huge.  I ordered a Turkish coffee to try it... but didn't realize it comes the size of an espresso, albeit in an elegant tea cup set, lol.  Got to savor my three sips with pinkie up of course.  Though brief, the bold dark roast was quite enjoyable.  I would love to come back and try the dinner menu which looks much more interesting!\", \"This is a perfect place for a cozy dinner.  The food is delicious, the service charming and friendly, and the restaurant is very pretty.We started with the chickpea bread, which came with adorable butter, shaped like a honeycomb. the little holes were full of delicious seasoned oils.The Manti (from my mom) were my favorite.  little meat-filled dumplings on top of tomato sauce and yogurt.For mains, our table got the salmon, filet and lamb shank.  Everything was well-made and tasty but the lamb shank (recommended by our waiter) was a standout.My husband thought the Turkish coffeee cake was one of the best desserts he's had in awhile.We'll definitely be back!\", 'My fiancé and I were able to snag a reservation to try out Bistro Ember during their first week of opening. The waiters and staff were very professional and attentive.  Understandably since it was their opening week, the wait was a bit longer than expected. Dishes we had:EMBER OYSTER - I got 6 of their oysters which were very fresh and light. Love the sauce that accompany them.TURKISH TARTARE - fun rendition of steak tartare with a Turkish flare. I thought it was good. Personally, when the kofte and tartare were  all mixed together, that usual tartare texture got lost a little. EMBER OCTOPUS - the octopus was nicely seasoned and perfectly cooked. The sauce it came with brought it together.COUSCOUS - delicious dish! It ended up being my entrée and I really enjoyed it. The calamari dolmas were very tasty and they went well with the basil purée. LAMB MUTACANA - the cooked lamb shoulder was good and it paired well with the mushrooms and keske (resembles a little to mashed potatoes). However, not a fan of the anise and plum purées. They felt too sweet and overpowering. For dessert, we shared the TURKISH COFFEE CAKE. Solid dessert and the star of this dish was actually the berries sorbet. Overall, our meal was very tasty and the plating of each dish we had was beautiful and seems intentional. They also have a decent wine selection to choose from.The restaurant is cozy and the decor is beautiful. I would recommend everyone to check them out!Congratulations on opening in Noe ! Wishing the team at Bistro Ember all the best!', 'Fabulous and cozy, Ember is a number one date night or special occasion eatery. Don\\'t let the \"Bistro\" fool you. This place has top-notch food and service. We had grilled octopus, seared ahi, Seabass and pasta. They served an amazing  dessert to my birthday wife and took care of us the whole time. Highly recommended.', 'When we saw the new signage a couple months ago for this restaurant, we were keen to give it a try. We really enjoyed the restaurant that was previously in this space, so we had high hopes that this would be another \"Go To\". Bistro Ember is a solid restaurant! As it\\'s in its infancy, there are a couple things that need improvement, but overall we were very pleased with the food and the service was very good. First off, the remodel of the space is very elegant... not pretentious in anyway, but definitely sets the tone that this is a \"fine dining\" experience. Bringing our 3 y/o boys might have been a mistake as the atmosphere isn\\'t conducive to kids, but the staff were so nice to them, as rowdy as they can be. The only knocks we had was that the portions are small for the prices charged and that the wine list is a bit limited, Overall, the food is very good and the experience of dining here is very pleasant. There\\'s room for improvement, and that should be viewed optimistically.', 'Good restaurant in Noe Valley. Interesting food options and nice atmosphere.

This is easily the most exciting restaurant I have been to in years. I can't wait to return. Everything was stellar. Bring your friends!\", 'Walked by this place on a Tuesday night, decided to give it a try. The restaurant was pretty full around 7pm. It\\'s a little crowded due to the layout and can be hard to talk or hear conversations. We didn\\'t have a reservation but they were able to sit us in a few minutes. Our table was wobbly so I asked the waiter to help. He said, \"let me check with my manager.\" I was in a bit of a shock since my request was a simple one. I don\\'t know if he was new or nervous but after he said that I was going to just fix it myself. Anyway, after waiting for about 15 minutes finally another waiter came by and tried to put something under the table. It didn\\'t completely stop the wobbling so my date had to fix it himself. It took awhile for the water and food to arrive. We ordered the sea bass and octopus. Both were over cooked. The octopus was tough and charred, and sea bass was dry. Flavor wise they were both very tasty and the presentation was done well. There were a lot of waiters that evening (5-6) which should be sufficient but the service was very slow. I think they need to have better training. It\\'s still relatively new so I am hoping the service and food quality would improve over time.', 'A wonderful Neighborhood Restaurant with relaxing Ambience friendly service and delicious food.

What more could you ask for?', 'The food was delicious. Every single item that we ordered was done really well and presentation of food was impressive.Service was quick and friendly. Loved the ambiance.', \"An astonishing, delicious meal at Bistro Ember, which has taken over a former Burmese restaurant. The dishes are billed as Mediterranean but there was a strong Turkish undertone to our selections. We started with the Fish & Raki salad, a refreshing combination of sweet melons and finely sliced kampachi. Our main course were the fried squash blossoms and grilled octopus tentacles. Both were delicious, with each ingredient not overpowering but complimenting the whole. We chose the burnt chicken skin pudding for dessert. I've had chicken cooked as dessert in Turkey and was delighted to see it on the menu. The portion for each dish is constrained - we much prefer this to the massive pile-up served in many restaurants. We look forward to returning and trying other items on the menu.\", \"A very special spot with warm and friendly service. Chef Deniz has brought the best of Mediterranean cuisine yet with a creative Californian touch. We had the Tomato & Watermelon, Little Gem Salad, and Fish and Raki as starters.

Overall, Bistro Ember is our favorite spot\", 'This place is so good!  I went with my friend who knows the chef or owner.  The food presentation was so good, the service was very attentive and the food was also very good, lots of variety and great portions, not too big or small!

The butter presentation alone was worth it.Squash blossoms and grilled octopus were a delight. So many deep flavors. I could eat 10 fried squash blossoms and still want more. dessert was a delight. When our daughter had a taste, she melted in my arms and swooned. Such a sweet place, we will be back!', 'Although we saw great reviews in the press, we were really motivated to go to EMBER based on the recommendation of a foodie friend. Rarely do we leave a restaurant thinking everything was 100% perfect but we definitely felt 100% satisfied at EMBER.

We wanted to order everything on the menu but decided to follow the suggestions of Emir who guided us towards his recommendations. We were not disappointed with anything we ordered.

If we had to pick one word to describe our experience, it would be --- flawless.', \"Upscale Mediterranean with very good food and service.  Our party tried 5 different starters to share.  All were unique, and delicious.  The beet salad was my favorite.  Our main courses were also amazing.  The eggplant was so tasty, and the lamb portion was hearty and perfectly seasoned.  All our dishes were presented beautifully on the plates.  Now let's talk dessert.  The Baklava was some of the best I've ever tasted and it was accompanied with an ice cream that vanilla heaven.  The Turkish coffee cake was also wonderful.  I really enjoyed the decor of the restaurant...very pleasing to the eyes.  The chairs were so comfortable and it has a cozy vibe.  I would definitely go back for the beet salad, manti and the eggplant entree, but saving room for the baklava.\", 'Ambience, food and service deserve a five star.  W e have been Bistro Ember twice and looking forward to our third visit soon.', \"Beautiful interior and outstanding service! Food was excellent, especially the green couscous and that divine lamb dish. I noticed a delicious, sultry umami flavor in these dishes whose delicate and balanced approach I've only ever encountered before in Japanese cuisine. Superb! The only reason for 4 stars is the lamb portion was quite small for the price\", 'Great food great and kind service. Good addition to the Noe dining scene. The couscous was bomb! My only recommendation is to hire an additional server, as when the restaurant was full there were only 2 servers. Dessert good as well, though took a bit to come out from the kitchen.', \"Terrific service, wonderful comforting food (slow-cooked lamb, polenta, etc.) from one of my favorite parts of the world, and perhaps the worst pinot noir I've ever had.

A crêpe or galette made with buckwheat, yummy and authentic.The restaurant is super cute, and it really could be a little neighbor place in France. They nailed the decor.I ordered the pariseinne, and it was delicious. My only wish is that they had a forestière so I could relive my year abroad. I wonder if they allow substitutions? I'll find out when I go back.\", \"I'm surprised this place isn't filled to the brim. The crepes are delicious and reasonably priced. I had the crepe with salmon and it was delicious! My friend got a strawberry crepe with icecream and chocolate sauce and that was my favorite! They have a wide selection of sweet and savory crepes and the service was amazing! Very tentative and the crepes came fast. The ambiance was nice and the tables and chairs were nicely selected. I would come agajn\", 'Got a question about La Sarrasine? Ask the Yelp community!', 'I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. Parking was fairly easy on this street, but I suspect we got lucky. It was great weather, so we opted to sit outside. The service is friendly and attentive. My group ordered 3 crepes to share, and I highly recommend doing so. My favorite was the smoked salmon one, but the florentine was also amazing. The sweet banana crepe was a great way to end off our meal. When we had our first bite of the sweet banana crepe, my first thought was \"oh wow, this is REAL chocolate (none of the fake stuff)\". Overall, I had an amazing experience.', \"I don't think of myself as particularly liking savory crepes, but my girlfriend and I needed to grab a quick bite before a nearby event and the place we'd originally planned on was closed, so we popped in here. I don't love fried eggs on my food either... but I got the Florentine and I LOVED it. The provencale salad was solid too. Plus we were in a rush and asked them to be quick, and managed to get in and out in just half an hour!\", \"Tried La Sarrasine for the first time today and I was really happy to find a solid creperie nearby. My husband had the signature Sarrasine crepe with the homemade merguez. He's a big merguez fan so it was his perfect crepe. I ordered the poulet, which tasted like a french onion soup with chicken and spinach. Service was great, we came around 3pm so it wasn't too busy, great location if you're hanging out at Alamo Square. I am adding this spot to my lunch/brunch rotation.\", 'I ordered the \"parisienne\" ham, egg, cheese crepe, as well as the banana crepe with nutella. The crepes are pretty good. One was not gonna be filling enough. The crepes are not inexpensive. For two I paid around $36. I got a coke as well. They have cafe drinks on menu. It\\'s a new creperie on Divisadero. I would come back. I love crepes.', \"Fantastic authentic French-style crepes -- savory buckwheat (blé de sarrasin) galettes and sweet crepes -- AND amazing French cider. This place is a real gem on Divisadero. The owner is really friendly, and the food is top-notch. We've been missing a good crepe-focused restaurant since the closures of the likes of ti couz & galette 88.My go-tos are the Provençal galette, the Niçoise salad, and the crispy fries.\", 'One of the best crepes I had was in Paris, two years ago, and I have finally found something just as good here in San Francisco.  This is a very cute small restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating.  My server was very nice and got my order right away.  I enjoyed every single bite.  I will be coming back again !!!', 'Nice ambiance and enjoyable mealService was warm and friendly I would recommend it', \"Service and food and ambiance is nice. Was hoping to try the new udon place but didn't notice it was closed Sundays so decided to try this new crepe place. Unfortunately they opened right next to the bean bag cafe which also serves crepes but hopefully everything works out ok between two creperies located next to each other. At times the bean bag cafe is a little too busy so hopefully there will be enough business for both. The smoked salmon crepe was good with salty capers and tangy fresh squeezed lemon. The cider was not as sweet as I'm used to but it was nice.\", 'So excited to have an authentic creperie in town. The galette was excellent. Felt like being back in small town France. Will definitely come back', \"A friend and I were seeing a show at The Independent and looking for a place to have dinner. We settled on crepes at La Sarrasine and loved them. We ordered the Sarrasine and Florentine and split them so we could have a taste of both. They were delicious, crispy (but not too crispy) ,and airy with flavorful fillings. Service was friendly, inviting, and prompt - we didn't wait long at all for our order. I enjoyed a glass of French cider. If we didn't have the show to go to, we would have probably stayed for dessert. I will definitely be back!\", 'Got a question about La Sarrasine? Ask the Yelp community!', 'A welcome addition to Divis! We happened to pass by on our way to Alamo Square Park and decided to soak up some sun here in the outdoor seating. I had the \"Parisienne\" buckwheat crepe which had a nice crisp and delectable egg yolk in the middle. Not sure how authentic the crepes are here, but they are for sure tasty!', \"What a neighborhood gem! Great wine, cider, espresso, and great authentic Brittany crepes - if you can't make it to Rennes, make it to La Sarrasine! Staff is so friendly and speaks French (bonus for Francophiles!) Enjoy your crepe on their parklet and watch all the neighborhood buzz on Divis at happy hour, brunch, lunch, or dinner. BTW - Sarrasine is buckwheat, aka these Brittany crepes are gf.\", 'We ordered two savory crepes. The crepe it self is very crispy not oily or soggy at all. And the center part added so much flavor. I love both of the crepe especially the Scandinavia - it is smoked salmon with crème super rich flavor, at the same time capers and lemon make it very refreshing. Would love to come again!', \"EXCELLENT! Finally an exceptional crepe place in San Francisco-the crispness and flavor are delicious. Cappuccino was top notch. The Bay Area has some pretty laughable crepes-happy that this place puts them to shame. These are true Parisienne crepes and they are just as delicious if not better than the ones you can get there. The crispness is really really special as buckwheat crepes can end up mushy. Outstanding! Nice french music playing, cute place-they just need to make it cozier and warmer, on a cold Sf day the door was wide open and they server wouldn't close the door so it was pretty cold.\", \"Honestly wasn't sure what to expect but the crepes are super. They're very French - presented flat to the plate, folded over the filling in the center with a wonderful gooey egg yolk at the center (depending on the dish you get).The buckwheat crepes are soft and light but also buttery. They're cooked to have a thin crispy exterior that gives way to a satisfying chew. I went for the Sarrasine - it was perfect. Spiced and flavorful without being overpowering. really took me back to the little creperies I visited in Paris\", \"I just tried La Sarrasine for lunch. I tried the Parisienne crepe with ham, eggs and cheese - it's a classic. They make it with bucketwheat flour which made the crepe taste absolutely delicious. Everything was well cooked and well served too - very fresh. My wife got the florentine crepe which was different as there was some sauce. I had a few bites after she got full and I was pleasantly surprised - very diff style but still very delicious. If you're looking for crepes I highly recommend trying this place. It's an easy place to pop in, have a good bite, and to boot you could go to bi-rite and chill in Alamo after. Great addition to the neighborhood!\", 'I liked the food.  Especially the dessert crepes. Service was decent. Ambiance was small and cute.', \"Nice to have a new breakfast/brunch option in the neighborhood, but not something I'd go out of your way for.I got the Parisienne crepe, which had good buckwheat flavor but felt a bit thick and soft - it wasn't quite crispy enough (the version at Le Marais is better).My friend got a ham and cheese omelette which she thought was okay, but wasn't particularly impressed by. Given how busy a lot of spots are on this street during brunch, it's a welcome addition as a rare place you can get seated immediately without a wait.\", \"Fantastic little neighborhood spot. Wonderfully made crêpes and Breton galettes as well as a handful of stellar North African dishes. Feels like an authentic little Parisian place. Good friendly service, breezy atmosphere, great outdoor seating with classic cafe chairs (gotta have 'em). A gem in the neighborhood.\", \"Boy do I ever miss Ti Couz, back in the day there was that astonishing little place of Breton, my first taste of buckwheat crepes, flat and folded over with delectable fillings, and  it was most known for their mushroom sauce. There's a ton of places serving crepes, but not buckwheat, and my last memory of it was when we were in Aix de Provence, but here in the Bay Area? Nope. Till yesterday when we came here and got a Niçoise salad and boules frites plus their Florentine/sofrito sauce/egg/cheese/mushroom crepe, and their Parisienne with ham, Swiss cheese, and egg. I'm super picky about salads, and this was not a home run for me. I won't go into details, other than to say their mussels were fresh [lump, and beautifully done. Their fries? Out of this world--not those awful should be illegal skinny hard shoestring fries, and not those godawful wedge cut ones. These were the absolute pinnacle perfection of what every French fry aspires to be in its French fry life. They're cut precisely, not to thick or thin, in perfect rectangles, crispy exterior and pillowy soft potatoey fluffy goodness inside--divine and soooo addictively good, did I mention they're perfectly salted? They're so freakin delicious, you will not need to dip them in anything, no condiment, no more salt or pepper, and even if you get the mouse, you likely will not find yourself hunting for the sauce for dipping, Seriously, they are that damn good. The main and sole attraction of this charming little spot is the buckwheat crepes: a generous serving with all sort of options from their classic ham egg cheese or more Americanized versions with Angus beef. Very hearty and beautifully cooked fresh fillings which comes away easily without a knife. I cannot rave enough about their crepes and would I go back here for them? In a heartbeat. There are not many places in the Bay Area for buckwheat and though I am not gluten free, it's a perfect option for those who are, hearty and filling, healthy. Btw., though we didn't ask, I'm sure they can likely customize a crepe for you, with fillings of your choice, I don't imagine it to be too difficult, especially when their kitchen is not slammed. We went in on a late afternoon, straddling peak times between lunch and dinner, when only one customer came in after us, so we had the entire little place to ourselves. The customer service was fantastic, our server (not sure if he's also the owner), was super attentive, and when he saw that we'd ordered more food than was going to comfortably fit on our small round table, he came forward to proactively slide the next table over, so we'd have more room. Very sweet. It's a quiet and very authentic little place, few round bistro type tables, with an easily accessible bathroom. Parking is a bear, but where is it not in S.F. The prices are way reasonable, especially for their generous portions. What I looooove so much about this place is they're continuously open, throughout the day, you can pop in anytime and they don't close., not one of those restaurants that are open for a rigid schedule for only a few hours during lunch and then for dinner ... or heaven forbid, they're not one of those place that's open only during dinner, and not for lunch. So this is just the epitome of freedom, e.g. go in whenever you're hungry or want to get together with someone!\", 'Got a question about La Sarrasine? Ask the Yelp community!', \"We finally have an authentic crêpes spot in the neighborhood.My partner and I are big fans. We've gone twice in two weeks.

Will definitely be back to try some more.', \"It's a brief trip to Paris without the hefty airfare! The moment I looked at this cute neighborhood eatery, I thought I had been transported to across the Atlantic. The tables and chairs are just like those in every corner of Paris. And the buckwheat crepes are the best I've had outside of Paris, even better than the ones I had in Quebec City, Canada. My faves are the Florentine and Poulette so far. Plus, save room for dessert crepes like the caramelized banana with ice cream. Can't wait to go back to try other flavors. I'm salivating just thinking about it... service was attentive and accommodating!!\", \"Just returned from a great meal at La Sarrasine.  Like other reviewers, we have been looking for a great creperie since Ti Couz closed - and La Sarrasine fits the bill.  Nice neighborhood feel, friendly staff, delicious authentic savory galettes, great sweet crepes for dessert and good cider.  It's a winning formula and we can't wait to return.\", \"The burger was crazy good. Grilled onions, a really delicious umami sauce. I also really loved the Parisienne crepe.

We were seated on the balcony, very comfortable, great ambiance. Loved the emphasis on fresh quality and rotating menu, which was excellent. We ordered several appetizers (loved the pork shoulder) and chose the duck breast, vegetable tagine, and pappardelle as our main. The duck breast was exquisite, tender, and wonderfully flavored (also quite a large portion size!). The pasta was also a stand-out for me, perfectly cooked. Loved the cocktails as well - eager to come back again for drinks.

The space if nice and the bar is a great place to eat and drink.  Although the bartender that serviced us had a flat personality we did see other staff who interacted well with customers and were friendly.  I would return but definitely would not recommend or try the burger again. Burger - 2.5/5 - I am admittedly not into thick patties on a burger, so Nopa's burger was an immediate turn off.  Still, I can appreciate a good burger but Nopa's just did not do it for me; at all.  Aside from being two inches thick the patty seriously lacked flavor.  Oh, and we asked for medium rare but got medium/medium well.  The meat dry and the bread did not hold together well.  Huge disappointment for, especially at a cost of $28. Fried Chicken - 3.5/5 - Tasty spices coated the skin exterior and the quarter bird was a great value.  However, the coating was fried to the point of being hard and the interior was not moist.  Maybe Nopa does not brine the chicken or maybe it was left in the fryer too long, either way the meat was dry and the fried chicken was okay at best.Roasted Cauliflower - 4/5 - I liked the texture and seasoning.  The beet purée was a perfect accompaniment.\", \"My sister and I travelled to SF for a siblings trip and my other sister suggested this restaurant. She has lived here for about 5 years and this is one of her favorite restaurants. I went here a few days ago and this is my favorite restaurant in SF. It is more expensive, but I understand why. Let me start out saying that this was the best broccoli and burger I've ever eaten. I was reaching for seconds and thirds of the broccoli. No broccoli or burger will ever compare to what I have tried here. The fried chicken was good and the crunchiest I've ever had. The pappardelle bolognese was tasty and filling. Really, you can't choose wrong here. Our server was very attentive and explained the menu well. There was never a time we needed something and didn't receive it. The food arrived about 45 min for the food was ordered. I will be back the next time I visit my sister. I cannot stop telling my local friends back home about the broccoli and burger.\", \"We really enjoyed this restaurant. The cocktails were the best part. They're a little expensive, but they are so cute, colorful, bright and delicious that it's so worth it! The food was excellent too. We got the duck breast and the pork chop, and those were both really tasty. It was busy and lively. Service was good too. You may need reservations, especially on a weekend.\", 'It is a sleek and cool restaurant with an upscale vibe! the cuisine was well made and delicious! The only negative was the Brussel Sprouts we found too salty.', 'Excellent food and excellent service at San Francisco prices.Firstly, make sure to make a reservation for this one as they are consistently booked up. I love places that are heavy on the shared plates so I can try a whole bunch and also love rotating menus. Every bite was delicious from the eggplant parmesan to the squash and corn flatbread to the peaches and stracciatella. Waitress had great recommendations. They used to have brunch which I heard was delicious and wish they would bring that back! As expected, it is not cheap but it is not outrageously price withers. Shared plates are around $20 and mains are $30-45 and I would recommend 3 shared places or one main and one shared for 2', \"A fun spot! The ambiance was excellent! I really loved the latke appetizer. The fried chicken entree was good for what it was. I'd love to come here to sit at the bar.\", 'Best burger in town.  Great chicken. Amazing martinis  Fantastic service,  recommend having a reservation or you will wait.', 'We were really looking forward to trying Nopa since some friends had spoken so highly of it, but it sadly did not live up to the hype. The pros: the food was yummy and the ambiance of the restaurant is great. Everything from the dining room to the bathrooms were decorated nicely. The cons: super expensive and overpriced for what you get, in my opinion. Our bill came to almost $140 for 2 apps and an entre, 1 cocktail, and 1 mocktail. We know pricing in the area is high in general, but compared to other meals we had for the same price the portions were super small (i.e., 1 slice of eggplant for $18), which was disappointing since it tasted great.', \"Made a reservation ahead of time on a Monday night, place was completely packed. Tall ceilings really helped with the sound control. Duck rillettes - well done dish, duck paired well with the breadCorn soup - in season corn was perfect for this soup. Perfectly smooth, good consistency, flavorful. Fried chicken - batter is flattened and tough, maybe that's what makes it Moroccan? Honey was a nice touch for more flavor. House pappardelle was also pretty good.House bread was disappointing and would be better if warmBurger was probably the most hyped and also most disappointing out of all the dishes. The patty is excellent but everything else was lacking.\", \"Had dinner at Nopa before seeing a show at the Independent. We sat outside and the parklet was heated, perfect for San Francisco weather. All of the food was delicious with simple, seasonal ingredients. One of my favorite ways to eat during the summer. Highlights were the corn salad side and the straciatella with grilled peach. We ordered a side of bread to go with the straciatella as well. Don't miss the bread, served with salted butter and was perfect. My only negative is that I feel it's a bit overpriced. Definitely recommend coming with a larger group so you can split and try more things. I'd make this a weeknight spot if the prices were a bit lower.\", 'San Francisco institution with some of the best Manhattan and burger combo in the city!', 'Nopa is def a local favorite and I totally understand why. Despite there being tons and tons of restaurants on Divisadero St, Nopa is unique in that you can tell they are really careful about their menu to make sure everything is local farm to table. The food screams \"California\" but is also more than just plain healthy food. We got this really good salad with peaches, walnuts, honey, and chunks of Stracciatella. We also got this flatbread with eggplants, zucchini\\'s, balsamic, and arugula. The sweetness from the eggplants and zucchini\\'s with the acidity of the balsamic worked really well together! We also got these lamb legs that weren\\'t my favorite but were cooked really well. This place is great for group dinners, service is great we chatted with our server for quite a bit- such a great vibe! Will be coming back soon', 'Solid burger consistent every time. The quality of the ingredients is what I love most.', 'This restaurant is top-notch worth visiting! The food is extremely fantastic, the wait staff very knowledgeable of their food. You can tell they are well trained and know how to create a verbal visual of their dishes. If I remember correctly, our server was Viv, and she took great care of our table of 6. It was a late reservation, so the dining area was scarcely filled w patrons. Nice high ceilings complimented the decor of the place -- it looked fancy, but at the same time, prices on the menu were affordable. We were all famished and knew exactly what we were having for dinner. The food and drinks were very quick to come out once  we ordered -- my tagine was just too big for me to finish it on my own, but the flavors were all there. I had a side of artesian bread and freshly made butter. The highlight of the meal was the dessert --- just decadent! Highly recommend!', \"Came here for dinner on Sunday at 6 without a reservation and was able to snag a table without any waiting. I got the pear and stracciatella, cheeseburger, and salted honey tart. The appetizer was pretty good, but wasn't anything too special. However, burger and fries was very good. The burger was cooked to perfection and incredibly juicy. I really enjoyed the fries as they were deliciously crispy on the outside and nice and fluffy on the inside. Dessert was pretty good as well. It was quite sweet but not overbearingly so. Overall, it was a good meal, would come back!\", \"What a delicious evening! While an expensive place, the portions were massive and quality was without a doubt amazing! Our server Max was super nice, in addition to fun costumes all around for Halloween. We ordered sooo much, and nearly fell on the floor.We began with drinks, the 50/50 Martini and the Hotel Nacional- both really good!In order of least favorite to favorite dishes (and all were delicious):5) WOOD BAKED GIGANTE BEANS, BREADCRUMBS, OREGANO PESTO AND FETA - very tasty, but wouldn't order again.4) PAPPARDELLE, NINE HOUR BOLOGNESE, BUTTERNUT SQUASH AND PARMESAN  - also delicious, but cold and didn't stand out that much to me.3) SMOKED BRISKET, LENTILS, ROASTED TURNIPS AND HORSERADISH CRÈME FRAÎCHE - tasted like hot pastrami that wasn't sliced, which was good and soft but not what I was hoping for.Please note that 2 and 1 were both legions above the rest and were amazing!2) WARREN PEAR, STRACCIATELLA, WALNUTS AND NOPA ROOFTOP HONEY - the cheese and honey and all in one mouthfuls were amazing!!1) MUSHROOM TOAST, FRESH RICOTTA, CARAMELIZED ONION AND BALSAMIC - just WOW. INSANELY GOOD!!We were unfortunately too full to order dessert. However the birthday girl got a complimentary brown butter cookie ice cream which was unbelievable!\", 'Super good food! The highlights were the fried chicken, mushroom toast, and persimmon appetizer. The chicken had an unbelievable crunch to it with a really unique flavor blend that we loved dipped in the chili honey. It was also a very generous portion! The mushroom toast was so flavorful on delicious bread that was so crispy and buttery. The only thing was our appetizers got pretty messed up and they didn\\'t do much to fix them. We ordered the mushroom toast and smoked trout appetizer and wanted a third option. We were deciding between three and asked the waiter, who wrote down all three appetizers, though we just wanted one of the three options. When we explained this to him when we got the appetizers that we did not order he only took off one from our bill as a \"gift\" to us because we were celebrating, rather than not charging us for 2 appetizers that we did not order. He also forgot the smoked trout which we really wanted to try but were so full by the time we could have it because of the extra appetizers that we couldn\\'t order it. Overall we totally understand that people make mistakes and our waiter was nice, but we didn\\'t feel that he adequately resolved this mistake which is why I took off a star.', 'Great food and menu. Really enjoyed the atmosphere. Definitely a place to go. Order the fried chicken!', \"I was delightfully surprised by Nopa's veggie forward menu. There's not a thing I would've changed about our meal. We started off with an order of bread - the butter was so fresh, delightful, and perfectly salted. Then, we got the smoked trout which was such a fun and playful dish - think Asian and Jewish fusion. The eggplant Parmesan was perfectly crispy, and the mix of pesto was just enough to elevate the dish. The gigante beans had such delicious breadcrumbs, and all the flavors slapped. The vegetable tagine had so many different veggies and tastes packed into one - the tartness of the yogurt, the salty/savory olives, ugh all of it came together perfectly!We ended with the chocolate budino which had cream, plum, and cocoa nibs. It was rich but the texture was light and creamy enough to not overdo it. The service was a bit slow and it was already pretty packed at 6:15 on a Friday, but if you're willing to take your time then you're in for a treat!\", \"Consistently rated one of the best burgers in San Francisco, I had this burger in my own Top Ten list from 2019.  I went back tonight and I'm glad to see some things have not changed post-Covid. The burger is simply fantastic...thick, juicy smokey burger...pickled red onion, butter lettuce and I added the bacon to put it over the top.  The fries were crispy and salty.  Perfection. Do your stomach a favor and go here hungry.Side note:  I had a 8:30 reservation for two, but got there at 7:30 and they were able to seat us, which was a pleasant surprise given the popularity of the place.\", \"My family reserved Nopa as a surprise dinner for my birthday and I loved our meal! They heard my many hints that Nopa is one of my favorite restaurants. This was my first time here with kids. They are generally kid friendly. I can't comment if they have high chairs or boosters (we didn't need any), but our kid's pasta came out very quickly and I saw other families there. We had a table on the first floor and the spacing was a little tight; they asked very nicely that our kids don't wander in the walking corridors between the tables. Totally understandable, but other restaurants might have a little more space and they would't be as strict about this ask.* Golden Fleece/Other Side Envy cocktail ($17) - 4 stars, nicely balanced, subtle, and tasty!* Little Gems, Strawberries salad ($20) - 4 stars, this looked simple but all the ingredients were insanely fresh.* Smoked Trout ($23) - 4 stars, a great array of flavors! * Moroccan Spiced Friend Chicken ($29) - * Country Pork Chop ($39) - 4.5 stars. This was insanely juicy, probably one of the best pork chops I've ever had.* Kid's Pappardelle - this came out very quickly, and our kids enjoyed it! The pasta was perfectly al dente and the sauce fresh.\", 'Everything was so delicious! The grilled peach appetizer paired so well with the honey-drizzled cheese and walnuts.My partner has had the burger here before and knew it was a stable and always a solid choice and never disappoints.I enjoyed the pork chop, and it was perfectly crisp on the outside while staying tender and juicy on the inside. It went super well with the sides which were really light veggies and tasted so refreshing together.The service was great, wine was smooth, vibe was awesome, definitely top notch experience.', 'Hands down, the best pork chop I\\'ve ever eaten! I was with a small group and we ordered the aforementioned pork chop, duck leg, fries, brussel sprouts, goat cheese, and potato latkes. The stars were easily the pork chop and the latkes (with smoked trout). The service was fantastic. They were very friendly and accommodating. Also, the vibe inside was ::insert the latest slang for \"cool\"::.', \"I came here on a Tuesday night and it was super busy! Really beautiful restaurant in a great location, we were seated on the upper area which gave a really nice view of the entire restaurant. Great location and really nice ambiance. For food, we started with the sausage and the rigatoni, and for mains we shared the flatbread and the Porchetta. Honestly I do not think any of these items stood out to me, everything was good but not very memorable. For dessert, we had the chocolate chip cookies and a chocolate pot de creme (not sure what it's called on the menu), which were really great! I honestly think the most standout thing was the shortbread that came with the chocolate pudding, it had a really delicate yet balanced flavour. Overall, I would return to nopa for the ambiance and since it's in such a great location, but not for the food itself. It was quite pricey for the items we got, but it is a really great spot for drinks.\", 'NOPA has a special place in our heart as we used to live in the neighborhood and came here for date nights. They always have the best pork chop. And funny when I text a friend we were dining there, she replied with \"best pork chop in SF.\" See, everyone agrees! The pork chop was cooked medium and came out juicy and so tasty. We started the evening sitting outside sipping cocktails and sharing French Fries and the Moroccan Fried Chicken entree as an appetizer between the 2.5 of us. Then we had the wine with Pork Chop, NY Steak, and Corn with Mushrooms and Tomatoes. Everything was tasty. Service was really good and we enjoyed our evening a lot. It was  busy for a Tuesday night but our server was attentive and checked on us. We always had a drink or sparkling water, and we didn\\'t go thirsty. We ended the night with a cocktail to accompany the Malted Milk Chocolate Ice Cream and a glass of wine to go with the Rhubarb and Lime Sorbet.', \"Wish I could give 4.5 stars because there are many excellent things about this place. The service was outstanding! Servers were knowledgeable, friendly, quick and not intrusive! The ambiance is fun and airy and considering the crowd, not terribly noisy. There were six of us so we got lots of different items from the menu. We ordered the bread and butter - exceptional, the dungeoness crab toast - generous and well seasoned, salad with avocado, oranges and nuts - fabulous! We also ordered the broccoli, and the cauliflower sides. Both were well prepared, tasty and generous. For the main courses we ordered the lamb meatballs, the pork chop, the pappardelli and the fried chicken. Everything was very good. Here's why I can't give them a 5. The fried chicken was perfectly fried and deliciously crispy but by itself was very under seasoned. It did come with a chili honey sauce but it was just too sweet for me. I found the menu here to be a bit limited. In other words if anyone in your party is a picky eater they may have trouble here. Be aware that the menu changes daily but they do seem to have some items consistently.\", 'Always a solid experience.I came here once in the past, but managed to get a dinner reservation for our group of four, which we were pleasantly surprised by. One of our party was vegetarian, but the rest of us decided to go family style on the recommendation of the waiter, who was super helpful and gave us super suggestions all throughout our meal.Starters:Tomato Soup - didn\\'t try this personally, but the table loved it!Josey Baker Bread + Butter - I mean if you have had this before, you know.Albacore - this was amazing. Our waiter described it as a \"deconstructed nicoise salad\", and you know what, he was pretty spot on. The albacore was perfectly seared, and the potatoes, peppers, olives, aioli, and green beans were just the right complements to the fresh fish.Mains:Moroccan Spiced Chicken - Super crispy, flavorful, and a generous portion for the table to sharePappardelle - Also really delicious and always a reliable option Cod - Looks like they don\\'t always have this on the menu, but this was perfectly seared and came with a generous side of broccolini - great lighter entreeThe above was a ton of food for three people to share, portions here are sizeable! We also ended the meal with a basil ice cream / stone fruit granita situation that the waiter recommended. This is one of those desserts that I think I\\'d be happy to come back just for. The phyllo bits in the granita were the perfect texture. Highly recommend!', \"Truly a delicious dinner experience! We made a reservation for a Tuesday evening and the place was poppin' even outdoors. The hosts were very accommodating of both our dogs and gave us a spacious yet tucked away table in their heated parklet. FOOD:We ordered 3 appetisers and an entree, which was ginormous and enough to leave 2 people stuffed. Overall delicious food focused on seasonal and local ingredients. I know this sounds like typical California cuisine but the execution is way above par!Fries (5/5): they're fries -- I was expecting them to be delicious but the aioli really put them over the top.Nectarine and stracciatella (5/5): This was the best thing we ate! The nectarine was almost stewed???? yet had a delicious char that complemented the milkiness of the stracciatella impeccably.Gigante beans (4/5): these were like a stewed bean dip with an oregano pesto. I liked it but it wasn't mind blowing (not that it had to be)Moroccan spiced chicken (5/5): SOOOOO crispy and juicy! There was probably 2 chickens' worth meat in there and it came with a yummy chili honey Overall I was really impressed with the place! Will go back and try dessert next time :)\", 'I\\'ve heard about this place for a while and finally got reservations to this place through Open Table and I will say the food is good but not absolutely \"amazing.\" Over all hit or miss for us and this is why: I will say though that the cocktails were indeed AMAZING, pricier price point but amazing for sure. So u would recommend going here for nice drinks if you are looking to take someone out somewhere with an elevated ambiance and innovative drinks that is worth the bang for your buck - this is the place. Food wise like I said it was good but wasn\\'t better than some other places I\\'ve been with a lower price point. The pork chop was actually kind of salty, moist, perfectly cooked but salty for sure. I liked the house made pappardelle actually but I felt like I had better at other more authentic Italian places in the city. The desserts though - AMAZING, they used very creative flavors and the guava tartlet we had with the scoop of cream cheese ice cream was sooooooo good! I still think this place is worth a try and would probably come back to try their other dishes.', 'I absolutely Do Not recommend this place.I came here with friends for my engagement dinner, We brought a cake we made ourselves and they made us pay $40 to let us keep it in their fridge. (But who cares)Everyone who worked there was very sweet except our waitress who was rude and greedyShe then asked if she we were ready for her \"to bring out the bread\" trying to deceive us that it was free but we realized it was in the menu and not complimentary or aka $7 for 2 pieces of bread and there was 8 of us. After we declined because we decided we didn\\'t want to spend $28 on bread for the table she acted disgruntled and annoyed!Back to the cake, they decided to charge us $3 a person to cut the cake and No they wouldn\\'t let us cut it ourselves, so we agreed.To conclude, be aware the 20% tip is already factored into the check which I would not say was deserved. Having us wait sometimes a good 15 - 20 minutes for a refill Can\\'t forget the 15 minutes for hot sauce that wasn\\'t needed by the time it arrived because there wasn\\'t any food left! Do not recommend Cool ambiance though.', 'I decided to get a reservation for Nopa as I was visiting SF and the Yelp reviews had the highest remarks. I was easily able to get reservations on Opentable a week or so out with no issues. A friend in SF told me Nopa was just fine and not worth it, but I didn\\'t listen. Mistake from me. On a cold night, I\\'m so glad I chose an indoor reservation for my party of 2. We did show up 4 minutes early, but we were not seated until 15 minutes after our reservation time at 8:15pm tonight. For a place that consistently gets super booked up, you would think they have a good pattern down. It was even more disappointing to know when I walked to the back of the restaurant to the restroom and noticing 4+ empty tables that were cleaned off and the table set. Once we were seated, the manager came by and apologized for the seating delay and told us there would be a gift from the chef. Great service (or so we thought).We decided to order the braised lamb shoulder and bread for our appetizers and a cider. The gift from the chef was the potato latkes. The lamb dish was so yummy and flavorful. I did wish there was more meat, but so delicious. The bread was good as well but the plating was odd as it tried to maintain a more modern approach. The potato latkes were so good and I enjoyed every bite. Potato latke itself might have been a smidge over fried but I love extra crispy potato. After finishing our appetizers, we waited more than 30 minutes for our entrees. At this point, we were both ready to go elsewhere as the delay was so long. Also, the server I had took my cider glass I had away while I still had several sips left in my glass?? He never asked if he could take my glass or if I was finished? I was just rather too shocked to stop him in that moment. I don\\'t know how this would be classified as good service especially as I paid for my full beverage and I expect to have it in its entirety. For our entrees, we ordered the cheeseburger and the New York steak. My boyfriend got the avocado and bacon on his burger as well for an extra $6. He liked the burger and overall said it was good, but he noticed the patty itself was not cooked evenly. The New York steak for me was the BIGGEST disappointment. As a big steak lover, this was a miss. I always eat steaks a medium rare and this steak was easily a rare in the very center and really blue. The steak and potatoes lacked salt. Potatoes seemed to be an afterthought with no flavor. The cilantro and herb blend they put on top had an incredibly weird and off putting flavor. It seemed they were trying to go in the chimichurri direction and missed. I\\'ve truly had better steaks and more enjoyable at Longhorn. I had maybe 4 bites before getting it to-go for anybody else to have. We planned on getting dessert here, but I was really so over Nopa at this point. I asked for the check, signed, and left before seeing the amount charged onto my credit card which was over the amount I estimated mentally. I called Nopa and asked for my receipt to verify my receipt. Nopa charged my table with the \"gift from the chef\". Mistakes happen, but this \"gift\" actually was more of a inconvenience for me. All in all, I won\\'t be back here and can\\'t recommend it given the other spectacular places in the area.', 'I call this robbery by the bar.  No one disclosed, no one asked. I ordered a vodka and cranberry. They overcharge me $3 to MAKE THE COCKTAIL (see attached photo).  Please, refresh my memory: isn\\'t that what any bar and bartenders do?  Well, at NOPA apparently not.  I went and spoke to the manager who obviously couldn\\'t care less and was dismissive (and walking away with my receipt) saying for me to \"feel free to post\" when I asked for my receipt back and said that I was going to post.  By the way, the bartender was also dismissive when I asked what was the \"cocktail charge\".  IF I knew, if I had been told in advance, I would have done the mixing myself or I would have simply left.  All those extra charges in the restaurants in the city are sickening and an utter abuse of the patron\\'s good will and tolerance.', \"I am leaving a review for the dessert and interior alone since me and my partner came here for a dessert date. Selfishly, I ordered the persimmon cake which, from reading on the menu, looked like nothing my partner would eat, but alas I persisted and ordered it anyway. I got myself a tea as well and while we waited we watched the kitchen work its magic. I've always enjoyed seeing the organized chaos of an environment but never knew a chefs table seat was something real. I know its not for everybody but if you care at all about a professional kitchen, get yourself a seat and enjoy! The relationship between all the cooks and the main chef, as well as watching everyones individual stations was such a sight for me. Honest to god would come back here just to watch these talented people make food.As for the cake, as predicted not loved by my partner, but I absolutely enjoyed it. The pomegranate with the delicate cake and vanilla ice cream all brought together for such a wonderful dining experience. One of the best desserts I've had in a while. The interior is truly lovely and I wish I remembered our waitresses name but she was such a joy. We got to speak briefly to the chef and I completely embarrassed myself as I was still totally entranced with the entire place. I'd love to come again someday.\", \"One of the best pork chops I've ever had! The ambience is phenomenal. The service is exquisite and their seasonal and ever changing menu Never fails to Disappoint. It is one of the safest bets if you're in San Francisco for a restaurant to go to!\", 'I brought some friends from out of town here last Thursday night. Due to the weather, we were lucky enough to get reservations the night before. We got there 2 hours early since we were already in the area, and they did not turn us away and took such good care of us! We even got seated an hour earlier than our reservation. Hands down, the service is phenomenal here. They took care of our coats and did not rush us during our dinner (which tends to happen a lot close to the end of the night) The meal was obviously great, the food here is so fresh and simple and executed so well.', \"We walked by Nopa and decided to stop for a late night meal. It is a beautiful restaurant and the food was phenomenal! Everything that came out was gorgeously plated and tasted even better than it looked. The lamb tartare was a prefect starter. The house made pappardelle, nine hour bolognese was the best pasta and bolognese I've ever had - my mouth is still watering for it. The duck leg paired perfectly with the sides. We rarely order dessert but had both the strawberry tiramisu and blueberry pie and WOW! They have dessert wine pairings as well. Our servers were attentive and friendly. I'm sure everything else on the menu is great but I would go back for the same exact order again and again! You don't want to pass up this palatable meal.\"]\n",

      "Reviews: ['Great spot for large groups. Food and drinks are good, would recommend the spicy pork belly', 'Great local spot, service is good and an especially good venue for a group lunch or dinner!', 'Delicious neighborhood spot with authentic Korean fare. Speedy service even during busier times!', \"We had a craving for Korean food on a random weekday and were gonna go to our usual 707 Sutter but found this new place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. So happy we did because we found our new spot! Apparently the owners here were a chef and a waitress at 707 and they decided to start their own thing (and the chef came up with a lot of dishes at 707!)Food hit the spot - we got kimchi jjigae, kimchi fried rice, bulgogi, and a soufflé egg. My fav was the kimchi jjigae, I fkn love soup and this was so flavorful and had plenty of tofu, pork and green onion  my boyfriend's favorite was the bulgogi. The kimchi fried rice was not too salty and came with an egg pour over that went well with our bulgogi. Aside from the amazing food the vibes were great and our server Taylor was the best!! I see some beer towers in the back so we'll definitely be coming back on a weekend especially since we live like 5 minutes away.\", \"The restaurant was pretty full on a Saturday night but we were able to get a table for 4 with almost no wait! Upon walking in, the vibes felt similar to 707 Sutter (a Korean restaurant in nob hill), with a giant kpop video projection on the wall as well but was significantly smaller in size. We got the army stew, bbq short ribs, bibimbap, and two bottles of the small soju cocktail (we should've just gotten one large one but it was so delicious we had to get another!) The food was great - army stew was very flavorful, bbq short ribs was very tender and juicy, and both the mango and lychee soju cocktails were fresh and had bits of pulp too. The reason I am docking a star is because of the price of the army stew - almost $40 for ingredients that probably sum up to less than $2?? I think that's a bit much, but hey, I guess suckers like me still go for it.\", \"'Oh looks pretty good''Oh it tastes really good'My friend and I went to this Korean restaurant on Polk street on a Tuesday night. We didn't have much expectation initially but we were really surprised by it.The BEST of the BEST is the seafood pancake!!!  It's a seafood pancake fluffy inside and crispy outside , and packed with many seafood and veggies. It totally satisfies my craving of Korean pancake.We also order bulgogi and Korean rice bowl. All dishes tastes good and comes in big portion. Personally I prefer the bulgogi to be less sweet and more spicy. Overall it's a neighborhood gem that I'm glad that I found it!\", \"If you're in the mood for some spicy comfort food, try Korean army stew (aka budae jiggae)! This dish is made up of an assortment of comfort foods like spam, sausage, ham, rice cake, beef, kimchi, ramen & and whole lot of green onions. I opted for no beans and added tofu for $2. The flavor was packing, but the broth/sauce was just way too salty. There's no way I would've been able to eat this without a bowl of rice! Ive ordered army stew plenty of times before at other Korean restaurants & it's never been this salty. I ended up adding a ton of water to the pot and letting it come to a boil to dilute the saltiness lol. I would come back and try the other dishes for sure!Service was quick and to the point on a Saturday afternoon, but there was only 1 server taking order & serving dishes while also packing up delivery orders. It wasn't too busy when I was there though so it was fine. The vibe is definitely casual, and I can see it being a bustling dinner spot to have some drinks over food.\", \"Summary:Solid Korean eats within city limitsDetails:TBH I wasn't expecting much from a Korean spot in this part of town, but was pleasantly surprised! Their menu is comprised of a good selection of KBBQ, and your other typical Korean fare like various pancakes, tteokbokki, KFC, and so on, with parties given the usual banchan at the start, albeit with a smaller (but refillable) than usual options.Their kimchi, seafood pancake, and short rib soups were the highlights of our meal, with the bibimbap being the least notable, and pretty lacking in flavor, though you can address that somewhat with the provided seasonings.As usual, not as good as what you can get in the East Bay, but certainly not a bad choice if you want to stay within SF proper!Accessibility:A spacious enough venue with your standard height tables, so accessibility shouldn't be an issue!\", 'Thicc galbiThis place does comfort Korean food for right. Was able to get a table with a short wait on a Friday night. We went for the budaejiggae and the galbi. Galbi was so good. Tender, hot, and juicy and sliced especially thick for maximum tenderness. The buddaejiggae was done right with all the classic ingredients and well seasoned broth. Prices are reasonable and service was excellent', \"Came to the city with wife and couldn't really decide on a place to have dinner... so I decided to come to Polk St and pick one from the wide selection off eateries here. Liked the pictures of Ollei on Yelp so we went there Ollei is a nice little place.  Around 11-12 tables and the ambiance is a comfortable one with dim (but sufficient) lighting. They got a projector playing k-pop music videos on the wall and the music level is just right. We ordered bulgogi soup, lettuce with miso, and seafood pancake. The staff was quick to take our order and bring us the food. The soup was a bit on the sweet side but very tasty; and my wife loved the lettuce and used it to wrap the miso and bulgogi. Personally I loved the pancake as it got a nice crispy skin, full of fillings inside, and paired nicely with the sauce.  I love Korean pancakes in general  We dug into the food right away and forgot to take pictures!  Snapped a pic of the outside though. Price is reasonable and place is clean. Highly recommended.\", 'No Fees', \"I'm so happy there's finally a solid Korean place in the Russian Hill district! It's a small place, but the vibes were nice, the service was really good, and the food was honestly tasty as well. The ambiance is more night-themed so the vibes were really chill, and they play k-pop music the entire time too which is always a plus.I came with family to try it out and we ordered a couple items. We got the Seaweed Rice Balls, the Corn Cheese, Korean Fried Chicken, Korean Army Stew, and as well as the Egg Souffle. Overall, I thought everything tasted like a really good comforting Korean meal. My favorites were the egg souffle and the korean army stew. The souffle was really soft, jiggly, warm, and it was seasoned really well. The Korean Army Stew, which is basically a bunch of things like top ramen, sausage, onions, mushrooms, spam, etc... stuffed together into one giant pot, was also pretty good. You let everything in there be boiled in their spicy soup broth that they make and just let everything cook inside. It's a fun experience and a great way to enjoy it with a big group of people. I like the convenience that's in the Russian Hill area which I live in, and I love that it's a Korean place that I can say I would come back to time and time again. If you're in the area, come try it out!\", \"I recommend Ollei for good, comforting Korean food. They have soups / stew, meats, noodles, and rice dishes. The price is very reasonable, good portions, and most importantly it tastes healthy and delicious. I recommend the grilled mackerel. It's not preferred to make it at home because of the smell but it was cooked perfectly and did not have the fishy taste or smell. It's a healthy dish that is rich in high-quality protein, Omega-3, and fatty acids. I also got the spicy squid dish. It was surprisingly very good. The sauce was delicious with fresh squid and veggies (onions and zucchini). And it is not too spicy. I would pour a spoonful of the sauce and squid over rice and mix it. The food took a while to come out but I was very satisfied with the quality of the food and great service.\", \"This spot on Polk has been a quick favorite after moving nearby. I appreciate the great food and how late they stay open. They do project and blast kpop throughout the evening and night. The servers are nice and quick. They also do have a great happy hour deal that covers later at night and not the usual timings when I'm stuck returning from work. All their dishes have a great spice level and they definitely can kick it up way high, made a slight mistake of overconfidence once. The most unique and one of my favorites is the creamy tteok and spaghetti. It doesn't seem like something that would work but it really does and it has a mild kick to it that goes great. I also really like the kimchi fried rice, being able to mix the egg in and then lay it flat to try and get some crispy bottom rice like a bibimbap. They do also have larger style Korean soups that I am still looking to try. They have great soju cocktails that sadly are not part of the happy hour deals they have but are still delicious regardless.  Definitely will be back soon!\", \"Had an excellent- and super filling- dinner with two friends here on a Friday night. The place was busy but not too crazy packed. Our waitress was super friendly and helpful on recommendations. We did find it funny that she apologized that the food would take a bit of time because the kitchen was backed up... only for the food to arrive within 15 minutes!The food:- Budae Jjigae (Army Soup): this was the star of the dinner and actually the main reason we came. My Korean friend was excited to see this on the menu and non of us were disappointed. The presentation was beautiful and the flavor and heartiness of the stew was excellent. All I can say is make sure you have a few people with you when ordering and definitely order this!- Grilled Pork Belly: wow. We ordered this on a whim in case the stew wouldn't be enough (it would've been) but man am I glad we did. The grill on the pork belly was perfect and the flavor had a delicious mix of fat, salt, and char. I'd honestly come back just for this + rice.- Kimchi Pancake: this was a pretty hefty pancake! I'm so used to thin kimchi pancakes but you're definitely getting your money's worth of ingredients here. And to no detriment to the flavor. This was a welcome addition as a side dish.Don't plan any strenuous activity after this place- you'll be moving very slowly, but happily fed. Will definitely be returning.\", \"A big group of us came here on a Saturday evening for some soju and food, and I'm really grateful they could accommodate us. I added us to the waitlist maybe like 20 minutes ahead of time, and our table was ready when we got there. We all got some bottles of Jinro is Back Soju to share, and for food, a few of us shared the Spicy Pork Belly, Kimchi Pancake, and the Japchae. All the food was solid, and prices were very reasonable from what you'd expect at a typical Korean restaurant. My favorite was probably the pork belly -- this was so flavorful and tender. The servers were sooo nice and friendly. So so grateful to have found this spot.\", \"The mackerel was delicious! Enough for 2 people too, just order a second side of rice and maybe an appetizer if you're hungry. Would definitely come back.\", \"Fast and friendly service. The plates are shared and decent portions and prices. I really enjoyed the dumplings. They're not too filled which is a bit of a let down but really good flavor. They also have a small selection of soju including this soju+tonic which was delicious and I recommend\", 'Ordered seafood pancake, spicy pork belly so review is based on that:Food: - Pancake 4.5/5- Pork belly 4/5Service: 4/5 - food came out quick- service was a bit slowerAmbiance: Casual Banchan was 4 dishes but it had everything I liked. Fish cake, kimchi, radish. Not as creative on the Banchan front compared to some of the best I\\'ve had, but good. The seafood pancake was fluffier than most places and seemed \"heartier\" because of that. Pork belly was good, but average if you\\'re going to compare. Sauce was good, felt like it had a honey glaze. Would come back again', \"This was absolutely destroyed in every aspect. We finished everything. We were a little afraid we ordered too much but it turned out to be the perfect amount. We saw the reviews on yelp and it's near a friends so I knew I had to try it. Walking in, I thought it would be a little fancier since it has such great reviews and the spot is honestly very cute and a casual eat out I would say. If your going somewhere for GOOD KOREAN FOOD. This is your spot. I came here with my boyfriend and a friends and it was one amazing time. Leichi soju: 5/5 would get again, super delicious and flavorful with actual leichi in it. Not the cálcico stuff. Chicken wings: 5/5 MY GOSH SO GOOD. perfectly flavored, cooked, amount of crunch but soft juicy inside, I would 100% come back for these. BBQ short ribs: 5/5 BEST SHORT RIBS I HAVE EVER HAD. GOOOO!!! Try these!!!! SO WORTH. Perfectly cooked, not that chewy, perfect seasoning and just so flavorful we couldn't stop eating it. Dumpling soup(veggie)(4/5) delicious. Just a solid soup with delicious veggies and veggie dumplings. We got the rice cake add on that was definitely a move. Clean light broth. Bi bim bap: 4.5/5 perfectly cooked, delicious. Very solid and tasty meal. Definitely recommend and if I'm ever craving it I will deff come back for this. Service was kind. Nothing out of the ordinary but the food really speaks for itself. Would definitely recommend this spot. already planning my next trip here, there's so much more to try!! All of this was $150 and I would say, for the amount of food and drink we got it was pretty reasonable and justified giving our experience with some DANK food. Super pumped to try it again.\", 'What an amazing lil slice of Korea on Polk St! Awesome service & even more awesome food. The pork belly was the perfect texture with an incredible spicy sauce. Prices were very reasonable which is always a plus in SF. The atmosphere is vibrant with kpop videos projected on the wall.', 'No Fees', \"Solid korean food in the Russian Hill area, with solid service and casual vibes- Tofu Stew: Very flavorful and nourishing! Better than most tofu soups I've had, although it was a bit spicy - Chicken wings: These turned out more saucy than crispy, and I would've liked more of a crunch and more batter. Still tasty and the meat was juicy!- Corn cheese: flavor and cheese pull was immaculate, would recommend\", 'I just got to try this place on sunday afternoon when my friend and I got hungry around 4pm. It seemed to be newly opened, right next to Teaspoon! We tried the seafood pancake and the wings (spicy and soy garlic). Both those dishes along with the ban chan were delicious! It looked like they had happy hour on weeknights as well, so it seemed like a good place to come after work to get a few drinks and munch on some food. The environment definitely reminded me of the korean bars like 707 Sutter. I definitely want to come back to this place for some drinks and to try their kalbi and other dishes!', \"TLDR: Solid Korean place on Polk Street close to Berber. Everything was a little sweeter than we thought it would be (could be a good or bad thing depending on your preferences), and the portions were large. I might be back if I need to find a place in the area and am craving Korean, but probably wouldn't go out of my way.------FOOD:1. [MUST TRY] Seafood pancake (5/5): Yeah this was awesome. Huge pancake with 6 large slices so a great thing to share with a big group. Thought it was nicely crispy and came out piping hot.2. Spicy pork belly (4.5/5): Delicious, definitely noticeably sweet, and spicier than expected, though not unbearably so. 3. Soft Tofu Soup (4.5/5): Large soup that could probably feed 2-3. Really really flavorful, and it's great that it comes with both tofu and your choice of meat. If you're a soup lover, order this. The spice is real though, so eat something else before you start on this.4. Bul Go Ki (4/5): Lots of sweet, thinly sliced meat. I thought all the meat dishes had very generous servings. Didn't blow me away or anything, but very solid.5. Egg souffle (4/5): Large serving. Nothing special and wish it had just a little more flavor (soy sauce? something else?) but does remind of simple, comforting home cooking. 6. Cheese corn (3.5/5): I've seen this in tv shows before so I always wanted to try it. I have no benchmark to cheese corn dishes elsewhere, but while I thought it was good, I probably won't order this again. Just not for me, but definitely an interesting combo of sweet (corn) and savory (cheese)!We also got served rice and banchan for the table with some of our dishes I believe, and the rice actually wasn't bad. The banchan was ok but it was nice that they gave refills. ------SERVICE:* Our food came out really fast when we ordered around 6 pm, but to be fair, we were one of the first groups to order so maybe that's why. * You scan a QR code at the table for the menu and then someone comes around to take your order. * Our waitress didn't seem as knowledgable about the menu and didn't seem as patient when we asked about it------ENVIRONMENT: * Casual place with lots of tables for 2-4 people. Not full around 6 pm on a weekday but definitely got a little busier by the time we left* Random, but they don't have a great bathroom in case you care about that :)\", \"New fav Korean spot lately! Feels like Ollei hit the spot for me in terms of authentic Korean food that's in between late-night food and normal Korean food haha. I ordered their japchae, kimchi pancakes and dumpling soup and they were all pretty good.\", \"8/2/2023Decided to venture out and so glad !We had Taylor as our server..was friendly and very informative and very sweet!We were moved to another table due to a party of 8.. and she was so apologetic-We received complimentary dumplings- and they were outstanding!They've only been opened three months, and if I lived here this would be my go to spot..Ordered the galbi ribs- so flavorful and not fatty at all..Also got the fried mackerel and it was perfectly cooked and the dipping sauce matched with the flavors.Great to see a full house !Went with the galbi ribs- seasoned just\", 'They say a picture is worth a thousand words. Well guess what I\\'d either need 40,000 pictures or 40 million words of praise to do this place justice. Also, get the \"bul go ki\" Brb walking into the back and telling the chef congratulations on nailing it', 'Food tasted decent. Kimchi pancakes and the fried chicken were the best from what we ate. Service was excellent. They were kind and brought an endless amount of side dishes for us! Ambiance fit the theme of Korean food. I also love how they open till 11pm!', 'I was so happy to see a new Korean restaurant in Russian Hill because there aren\\'t that many in this area. The only other one I can think of is Korean Soul Chicken down Polk Street! My husband and I came to Ollei on a Saturday evening and it was packed! We had to wait a little to be seated, but i\\'m glad they\\'re doing well. I loved how they played kpop videos on the wall with a projector too.What we ordered:- Ollei chicken wings with soy garlic sauce: The soy garlic sauce was delicious! However, the chicken wings weren\\'t crispy at all. T.T I didn\\'t expect them to be super crispy since they were sauced up, but I did expect a little crunch like usual with Korean fried chicken.- Seafood pancake: The pancake was good, but thinner than i\\'m used to. Also, there\\'s not a lot of seafood in it. Still a good pancake though!- \"Beef\" and vegetable japchae: The japchae was delicious with a sweet and savory sauce. I put quotes on the \"beef\" because though it states there\\'s beef in the menu description, there was no beef to be found in the dish. I liked the shitake mushrooms though. Maybe they forgot it? Or they should take beef out of the description.Service was good, but since they were busy, the food took a while to come out--totally fine with this since it\\'s a new restaurant and they were super busy, but just writing it so other people are aware! Overall it\\'s a good Korean restaurant for Russian Hill, but I have other favorite Korean restaurants across the city.', 'So excited for a new Korean restaurant to open up in the neighborhood! Polk street lacks a bit in Asian food and not only does Ollei add to the diversity but also it elevates the food quality. I went around 7:15pm on a Monday and every table was filled except for one, with a trickle of people grabbing take out as well. The vibe is lively and casual with kpop blasting and music videos playing on the wall (similar to 707 or zzan). Banchan- 5/5 delicious!Kimchi pancake- 4/5 perfectly crispy on the outside and so so soft on the inside. Could have used a bit more kimchi flavor but still so goodBeef Soft tofu soup- 5/5 you have the option of ordering the tofu soup with beef or seafood. The soup base is on the thicker side and pairs perfectly with rice. Beef ribs- 4/5 a little salty but amazing flavor Service- super nice and attentive staffLooking forward to trying the rest of the menu :)', \"It's always exciting to hear of a new Korean restaurant in SF since there are so few! I came to get takeout, and the workers seemed really nice when I picked up my order.I got a soft tofu soup with beef. I thought it was just ok, far from the best I'd had. It was a bit bland/watery, and lacked the umami and dimension that I was expected. Also, I'm not sure if it's normal, but they cracked the egg into my to-go container and didn't stir it, so my egg had already cooked when I discovered it at the bottom.I did like that the order came with banchan and rice though! Maybe I'd come back to try a different dish if I'm craving Korean and in the area.\", 'No Fees', \"It's been hard to find a restaurant open late now days especially in the Polk Street area. Luckily I found out about this spot through Instagram which is conveniently located in my neighborhood.The staff is super pleasant and attentive. The food is tasty and great for groups to share. You can't go wrong with their fried chicken, Korean pancakes, or stews. I hear that they are attempting to try some new things on their menu in the future, so I am excited to see what is to come.\\xa0Overall, I had a great experience here. I will definitely be back especially when my friends and I need a bite to eat later in the evening. I'd also say this is a great location as there are not many restaurants open late on Polk Street for those hitting up the bars.\", 'Came by to this restaurant because we had friends in town and it popped up on Yelp. We got a resounding and validating comment from our friends after eating here about how \"we know good restaurants,\" -- Yay!The army stew was sooooo good. So good we asked for more ramen and soup to fill it in. I\\'m craving it as we speak. The flavor wasn\\'t overly salty, it was robust and the ingredients -- spam, veggies, etc. we\\'re delicious.That dish and the toppoki were my favorite standouts. In that dish, they had a skewer + fish cake which had me holding back to be cordial the greater crew.The ambiance was nice; not overly crowded / busy. It\\'s new and clean! High ceilings btw. I liked how the tables were spaced out. This will be the go-to spot to ask my boyfriend to go to when we\\'re craving Korean :)Excited to come back!', 'Wow! Cold noodle dishes were sooo good here. A relatively new addition onto Polk, we were searching for some cold noodles and stumbled upon this Korean restaurant. We ordered the cold buckwheat noodles and the cold kimchi noodles as well as a bibimbap. The place was relatively crowded and this was on a weekday at around 7:30 PM so we luckily got seated at the last empty table in the small restaurant. The food came out pretty fast, and we also shared a kimchi pancake as an appetizer, which is very different than the seafood pancake that you normally get at a Korean Restaurant. The cold noodles were really good and very typical traditional cold noodles, the flavor was sour compared to what one might think, but it was delicious. I would definitely see myself coming here again to try there different dishes.', 'Great service, and food was excellent. We ordered happy hour drinks, which runs from 9-11pm Sunday to Thursday.', 'My party got the Ttok Bok Ki Plate and the Short Rib Soup. These two dishes can feed a party of three and be satisfied and not overly full.Upon entering around 7:30pm on a Thursday night  it was surprisingly empty. We stayed until around 10pm and there was always a table available. Which is great, because honestly this place is underrated. The environment was nicely decorated and it was never too loud.The sauce for the Ttok Bok Ki Plate was spicy (a good level I would say I have a high spice tolerance too) and slightly sweet and the Short Rib Soup was very flavorful and the meat was tender! Hack ask them to melt some cheese for you for the Ttok Bok Ki to dip!Service here is prompt, and they seem to know their menus and popular items well.I would definitely come back here, my only regret is I wish I took pictures of the meals!', 'Excellent, Affordable as well, strongly recommend The service was great and the food delicious.', \"Ollei is a good new spot on Polk. The food is flavorful and is good to share with a lot of people so you can try different things. Their corn cheese is one of the best I've had. It is a bit on the pricier side.\", \"This is my Korean food spot whenever I'm in town! The food is so savory and delicious! The servers are always kind and attentive, the place is a little small but it's still pretty cozy!\", \"Food was great and service by Taylor was excellent.  We had the Mackerel and galbi ribs - so delicious.  We had to move tables due to an unexpected reservation and they comped us an appetizer of pot stickers which was very good, especially the sauce.  We'll be back for sure.\", \"This is the way Tteok Bok Ki ought to be. Huge bowl of it. Loved the veggie pancake and tofu soup as well. All around solid experience.

      "Reviews: ['Dolly was such an amazing bartender/server! She made us feel welcome and took great care of us -- not to mention, her music taste is impeccable! We love Dolly and we love Fermentation Lab! uwuuuuu', \"Pretty nice venue smack dab in the middle of Japantown. Service was super friendly and we were checked on often, although we were there right at open so it wasn't very crowded yet. We came here for SF Restaurant Week though we ended up ordering off the regular menu while our friends ordered the RW tasting menu. Overall we thought the food was pretty good and reasonably priced. It's a bit of an odd mix of cuisines with Loco mocos sitting on the same menu as churros, gochujang tartare, and duck confit salad. Pan-asianish, I guess?What we had was good though. The fried calamari had other fried goodies like artichokes, shrimp and jalapeños as well. The breading was light, which is the way we like it. My companion liked the Pina Verde a lot. The standout to me was the Loco Moco. I really liked that they breaded and fried the patty. Definitely my favorite dish. We all shared the oysters and personally I preferred the poached over the fresh ones which came sprinkled with ice crumbles. The deviled eggs came with two different kinds of- a bacon based one and a smoked salmon one. We both preferred the bacon one. Portion sizes were much bigger than we expected too, given the prices. We'll definitely be back!\", \"My friends and I came for SF Restaurant Week on a Sunday night and it was pretty packed! This menu is significantly different from their location on Market. They have more items and also seafood as well! It isn't a typical restaurant and more of a bar/restaurant combo as they have lounge seating and a stocked bar. You seat yourself when you enter and a server will hand you the menus. Service was pretty good, but they seemed a bit understaffed for the Restaurant Week rush. The Restaurant Week menu was a good deal at $45. We were able to try a few of their appetizers, an entree, and also a dessert! Half of our table picked the Uni Pasta, but hey had run out of the squid ink pasta unfortunately. The lemon pasta substitution just didn't taste as good with the flavors as squid ink! We also ordered the duck fat fries and brussels sprouts as appetizers in addition to the prix fixe menu. Both were just okay and the brussels sprouts were ridiculously tiny! I probably wouldn't either of these again. Overall, it was a pretty good dining experience and parking is easy at the Japan Center lot!\", \"*restaurant week*This new spot was excellent. It's so hard to pick a favorite dish. We don't even know what the soup of the day was, but it was perfect! The tartare was delicious with wonderful flavors. The loco moco is rich with a hint of cinnamon. The devils egg, cucumber & hummus, tuna, fried chicken sliders, and churros were great too!Bonus: the staff was so nice\", 'Cool vibe with delicious food! We went near opening and sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly and attentive.', \"This place is such a chill hangout spot to go with friends. It's a self seating area that has tables, couches, as well as a bar. It's dimly lit with a nice modern aesthetic, and they even play a movie through a projector on one of the walls (oceans 11 and John Wick 2).We started with cocktails - all of them were great, but I have never tried something like the wasabi margarita. It has a kick to it, but it's pleasant and works really well in the drink. If you don't mind a wasabi kick in your drink, I would very highly recommend it. They also had a wide variety of beers on tap. For food, we started with tapas. The Duck Fat fries were absolutely delicious and it came with an awesome scallion aioli - I just wish it came with more sauce! They also picked vegetables which were juicy, tangy, and crunchy. We also had the poached oysters and deviled eggs, but the first two were delectable. For mains, we all got the Fermlab burger, and none of us were disappointed. My friend, whose review is probably close to mine, said that this was the best burger he's had in SF so far, and I think I agree. For dessert, our group was indecisive so we went with all three options - the churros, the brûlée, and the pear bread pudding which comes with ice cream. All three were delicious and group-friendly. Our service was great, our waitress Dani was so nice and made sure all of our needs were taken care of. Overall, this is a great spot and I can't wait to try the original one by mid market!\", \"Fantastic cocktails and delicious small plates. Bartender is the best of the best. The place has a great vibe.We ordered the fries, poached oysters, calamari, burger and pickled vegetables. Everything was delicious, but I especially loved the poached oysters which I've never had prepared that way before. Will definitely be back!\", \"If Dolly's your bartender, you're in for a TREAT! My friend and I came here for a girls' night ~catch up~ over drinks; we came for the beers (which I have to note are very well priced!!) but seriously fell for our bartender. It was a slower weekend night, so we got to sit at the bar and chat with Dolly. My friend needed an energy boost and was debating ordering a coffee/espresso, and Dolly instead whipped out this seriously addictive take on an espresso martini--adding her twist with UBE!!! Absolutely sickening. I told myself I wasn't going to have more than one drink, but that cocktail was seriously one of the best I've ever had. Love the ambiance, the staff, the drinks. They also projected a Japanese(?) movie on the walls when we were there, which just added this very cool vibe. Will def be back to try the tartare which we saw on the menu and were intrigued by, but wasn't available just yet!!\", \"My friends and I saw this restaurant featured on the SF Restaurant Week list and wanted to give it a try. The workers were friendly and the interior was polished and cozy.  We ordered off of the pre fixe menu and it was good for the most part. The only dish that was disappointing was the uni pasta, as I was expecting an umami, buttery, and creamy flavor profile. I was pretty surprised by a strange sour taste in the sauce, like there was either spoiled cream or a white wine sauce that was not cooked all the way through. However, I don't think the uni pasta was supposed to taste like that so maybe that was just a bad fluke. My other friends who ordered this pasta and myself all reported that our stomachs were a little upset later that night.Tldr: the service deserves five stars, but the uni pasta was unfortunately unforgettable\", \"Hey, I recognize that logo! Great to have a chance to try Fermentation Lab's new location in Japantown. Chill lounge vibe with a solid beer list and a short but well-curated wine list. Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Looking forward to coming back to try the food next time.\", \"A former Denny's (really!?) that has been the F.L. for about eight weeks, as of this review.I'm new to J-Town, and was looking for a good cocktail bar without karaoke, near the AMC Kabuki. This fit the bill nicely. I arrived alone around nine thirty, and there were free tables and some places at the bar, where I perched. The cocktail menu has some creativity - I always look for drinks based on whiskey and/or mezcal, with ingredients I don't have in my home bar, and this place has a couple.The bar bites menu had fresh oysters with pear, that tasted mostly like fresh oysters with vaguely flavored ice chips on top, but they were oysters all the same, so fine. There were vegan potstickers which I love, but fail to cook properly at home. They were served with an interesting lattice on top, that my picture fails to capture. Hugo, my bartender was very entertaining, and tried to psyche me out about the potsticker spiciness heat (there wasn't any). The signature cocktail menu was all $16 each, and there wasn't any real high end liquor or wine on display. No liquor menu either. Behind me were two areas with projected video, placed in such a way that only the bar staff could see it, which was odd. Some dumb movie playing. Anyway, nothing terribly special, but very clean and tidy, a very classy interior space, fabulous non-gender bathroom. I'd probably come back. They oysters were priced less than $4 per, which is a big yardstick for me.\", 'The food was delicious. Stopped by for SF restaurant week and glad I did! Service was also so amazing. The waiters were so kind and gave great recommendations. The vibes were also amazing with the lights and movie playing in the background.', 'Tried the duck fat fries, uni pasta, makgeoli braised pork belly, and the beef tenderloin tips with friends. I would recommend everything besides the pork belly as the portion was astoundingly small for an entree but the server was nice and was able to accommodate for it. The ambiance was nice for drinks with friends with movies being projected onto the wall, would come back.', \"I've now been to 2 Fermentation Lab locations and at both the food and service were great. I love the tasty combinations on the menu and the selection of beers was good. Our server, Trinity, was friendly and engaging and quickly took care of an issue that brought us the wrong beers.  This is a great place for a drink and a bite before a show at the Fillmore!\", 'New gathering place in Japantown! Tasty, creative small plates and drinks in a cozy space. Ive been to Fermentation Lab twice with 2 groups, both times the food and service were excellent. The menu is eclectic, with oysters, French fries, burgers and kimchee!  The hamburger was a generous portion, duck tacos flavorful, and shrimp/beef skewers grilled just right. Great for groups or corporate events. Proud to support a local AAPI female owner! Highly recommend and will be back.', 'The servers are liberals trying to force their thoughts into mine. I dont apreciate it. It was very unpleasant...', \"Great place for getting some small plate food. Was there for a meeting with about a dozen of us, and we had pretty much the menu !  Everything was tasty and well prepared. The service was great. Was a roomy atmosphere. But it's a bit dark due to the black decore, but it was comfortable there.\", 'Excellent service and food. The burgers, brussel sprouts, chicken sliders, and all of the other dishes we ordered were top notch.', 'The staff were so friendly and fun. The cocktails were delicious and innovative and I was a huge fan of the kimchi potstickers. Lively but not overcrowded. Great ambiance for group gatherings or a one-on-one catch up or date.', 'Great new bar in our neighborhood, so many tasty options to go along with our beer. Beer battered onion rings were delicious, calamari misto was a generous portion and went perfectly with the double IPA, wine poached pear salad was also great. We look forward to dining here again, more dishes to try.', 'Great service, great cocktails. Seafood pajeon and sliders were great, and so were the duck fat fries. Chill fun bar, nice addition to the neighborhood', 'Wonderful experience!!! We came from out of town to visit and we stumbled upon this cute place. The staff was amazing and super attentive.', \"Great drinks and great service! A new place for us. My friends and I picked a few of their signature mixed drinks on their menu.  Only one friend didn't like his drink and he didn't even have to say a thing.  The waitress came by,  noticing he wasn't into it and immediately offered to get him something else.  He decided to go with just an old fashioned.  The bartender delivered it himself, said he made it and was sure my buddy was going to like it.  My buddy said it was one of the best old fashioned he's had.  Through the night they continued to check on us and were never pushy.  It was a great first experience.\", \"Love the drinks! Great service at the bar. Insanely knowledge bartender and attentive service. Didn't get to try to food, but enjoyed the ambiance and decore!\", 'Wow, what a surprising find in Japantown.! Great ambience for a drink or cocktail with wonderful service and yummy bites!  We will definitely return', 'Such a great addition to the neighborhood!

      "Reviews: [\"The freshest in SF and the prettiest!O R D E R E D - Deluxe Box- Truffle Chirashi Box- Thai Tea- Matcha BobaV E R D I C TI can see why fish in the box is so popular! Every box is made so beautifully and tastes delicious. I haven't found another stop in SF to top them in terms of taste, aesthetic and price. For the amount of ingredients they give you in each box is so worth the price they charge. If you feel otherwise, go make your own hahaParking isn't horrible, if you choose not to take public transportation or uber, there's usually parking on the residential area and its not too far from their shop. Service is also very quick and easy to order from their kiosk.\", \"Thanks to DoorDash, I got to skip the lines and pick my Deluxe Box very quickly. This box is SUPER luxurious - it's ladden with fatty salmon, ikura, sweet shrimp, scallops, toro, and real crab meat! The proteins were also very plentiful and I especially loved the generous amount of real crab meat. Although, I do think their sushi rice could have some improvements - it has way too much vinegar that drowns out the sweetness of the fish. It was also not a toothsome as it could be, more mushy. I got an Ube milk tea as well, which was not my favorite. It was super sweet and the flavor of Ube barely came through - mostly just sweet purple milk. Skip the drinks and go somewhere else in my opinion!Overall, I think Fish in the Box is making great chirashi bowls! If you have some sticker shock from the price (as I did), I would definitely get this again and split it with another person since it is more than enough. And by girl math, that's 50% off the price of the bowl so it is a good deal. Pro-tip: if you do take out, you can eat this with some seaweed snack packs for mini hand rolls!\", \"I go here sometimes for their poke bowls, which are always solid in taste. I get their vegan shiitake one since I am vegetarian and it always hits the spot. their sauces are good and ingredients are fresh. The dishes are a bit on the smaller size so I think it's a bit on the pricey side. However service is fast and it has a cute ambiance as well.\", 'Okay, so they don\\'t have a brown rice  option for the Spring Bowl, but it came with a decent amount of fresh, tender salmon and tuna (and the organic salad base helped me eat less rice)...so...win-win. This place has probably thee freshest poke I\\'ve ever had. I did think they could\\'ve gone a little easier on the sauce though because it was going towards being a little too salty. And another downside was that I found a bone in one of the fish pieces (thankfully, I chew my food slowly, so I didn\\'t bite into it and was able to detect it).The place itself is pretty tiny, making me think that the \"Fish in the Box\" concept is not just about the food packaging but the restaurant itself. I did like how bright it was inside from the outside sunlight.', \"Arrived around 1:30pm and ordered on the kiosk. It's a pretty small shop with 2-3 tables. Food was ready fairly quickly. I ordered the salmon bowl and I was so excited because it looked so good. But boy was I so wrong... My first bite tasted okay but after chewing some more, the strong fishy taste hit me. It didn't taste fresh at all. This bowl was not cheap and I didn't want to waste it so I tried eating some more thinking it would be manageable. 3 bites in and I had to throw it away. 30 mins to an hour later, I started feeling really nauseous. I'm not sure if it was the lingering fishy taste in my mouth or because the fish wasn't fresh or maybe both???Unfortunately I will not be coming back here nor will I be recommending this place to others.\", 'We both got chicken curry over rice. The curry has an interesting taste. It is not like Indian curry or Thai curry. This one has a light taste of sourness. It kinda helps to soften the greasiness of the deep fried chicken. Something I really liked was the rice. Their rice is very good, not too sticky or too dry. It is great quality and cooked with dedication. I will come back and try more stuff here.', 'They have a really good chicken Katsu curry, poke bowl & wraps. Love their food.Highly recommend!!', \"Got the two protein poke bowl with salmon and spicy tuna. The fish quality is very fresh with a variety of toppings and sauces to choose from! We did delivery after a workout and all of us were famished. I ended up eating 1.5 poke bowls. I preferred the unagi sauce over the spicy mayo and did half rice half salad. I haven't been to the actual restaurant but I heard it is cute!\", \"A small spot on the corner of the intersection, I was pretty impressed with the quality and freshness of the fish! The prices are on average around $14-18, which isn't the worst for sushi/poke. I got the Orange Blossom sushirrito and it was delicious! It was on the smaller side, but packed with goodies like avocado and roe and seasoned well. The place is super clean, you order with iPad, and there's some seating inside!\", \"I got the Deluxe Box ($50) which came with negi toro, ikura, crab salad, truffle scallops, lightly smoked salmon, and incredibly fresh raw shrimp. The box was presented beautifully, and the rice bed underneath was incredibly well seasoned. For the amount of seafood, $50 isn't a terrible deal in my opinion. Everything tasted fresh and delicious, especially when mixed up.This shop is fast casual- you pop your order in the iPad and they call out your name. I came around 7 pm on a Thursday and they were pretty backed up on orders- waited about 25 mins for my food. There's a few tables inside but wouldn't count on dining in next time.\", \"An important disclaimer: I do not eat seafood. So I did not sample any seafood-adjacent dishes. Instead, I stopped by on a Friday afternoon on the way back from the library (public library plug!!) and got myself two treats for finishing the week: an ube milk tea, and chicken karaage. Ordering is done on a tablet at the front; you get a number then pick it up at the window. There is some seating, but not a whole lot - two tables outside, and a couple inside. The spot is small but cute and clean. Prices are a tad bit high for the food imo (see 4 star rating) but take this with the grain of salt and my seafood aversion. I liked my chicken (image attached) - it came with enough to share with one other person, or just for me to eat alone (heh). The drink was also good, but came out to nearly $8 for dairy-free and to add boba. A dagger to my lactose-intolerant soul and my wallet. It was a bit sweet, and there were no options I saw to modify that, so be warned if that's not what you are going for - there are other drink options (matcha, a juice looking thing, Thai iced tea), but I haven't tried any of them to know how they measure up.Overall this is a cute, even boutique-esque spot for food. Good for stopping by and getting a treat! (Treats can be savory too!!)\", \"Tried to give Amiti's another chance but it really disappointed me again. Overall the ingredients are T that tasty, something is meh about it and it's not very customizable.They don't take special request to do half rice half salad even though I asked in person to make sure. They were out of a lot of ingredients like tuna, edamame, corn. The seaweed and a lot of the ingredients just feel underwhelming. The flavor in the bowl is lacking so I tried requesting more sauce this time but they missed that request again. I wouldn't recommend this place.\", \"A quickie review for an early dinner on a random weeknight. I was on my way to USF for a work event while I was craving curry katsu. Yes, I know they are mainly a fish place, but I just couldn't get past my fried food itch. Ordering is all on a tablet. The staff just gives you a bag with your food.All food is served to go. It's pretty tight inside, but it's still well appointed. The chicken katsu was pretty thin, so it wasn't too juicy. The curry sauce had a few carrots and potatoes at the bottom. It was tasty, but there was almost a bit of a sour flavor? Still, it was good enough and priced well, so I'll be back to try the fish next time!P.S. Parking is atrocious. Come with a friend to run in and to pick your food up!\", \"Upon hearing glowing recommendations and seeing enticing pictures of the deluxe box, I was excited to dine here. However the sushi rice was seriously a major let-down given the price point of the deluxe box, which certainly wasn't cheap. The Good:The torched salmon, ikura, and snow crab were definite winners. The ikura, in particular, had a sweetness that I enjoyed.The Not-So-Good:The sushi rice was the weakest link. It was so dry and almost devoid of flavor (my bf spat out the rice). Sushi rice is the cornerstone of any sushi experience, and its poor quality greatly detracted from the overall meal.While the seafood toppings showed promise, the lackluster sushi rice left me with disappointed/mixed feelings about this place. I'd be willing to return if they improve their rice\", '\"Love is the reason why there is pain.\" - NarutoAm I the only San Franciscan that hasn\\'t tried Amitis Café? The Moderne Japanese Cafe located in NOPA - Just look for the Corgi art! I finally made it and found out it\\'s take-out only. Poke, Sushi, Fusion Japanese are popular here, but I had a Curry over Rice mad craving! Young friendly Irezumi tattoo\\'d staff to greet you. I decided to just order at the window counter. Chicken Katsu Curry over Rice is my order as I walk around the block to enjoy the picturesque day in the bay. Less than ten minutes later I return with my order ready. I decided to take it to Japantown and eat it near the Pagoda. The first bite is usually everything with me and tbh was not blown away by the Katsu. The Curry was of high quality and the Japanese grade rice fluffy. So I took more bites and it\\'s one of the dishes that would be way better eating it freshly made in a café. Don\\'t get me wrong it was good, but the Chicken Katsu seemed pre-made for the day, so not as mind blowing as other Curry Houses in the city. The actual Curry was delicious, chunky, and no question \"home made\". All else mingled in harmony and with the Genmaicha Tea from Nijiya made it a perfect picnic! In the end, I recommend Amitis Café to anyone into Japanese cuisine. However, I\\'d suggest passing on the Curry as I found it to be just okay. Go with the various Poke, Sushi, or J-Fusion dishes which seems to fly off the counter here. Expect to bring it home with you or find me under the Pagoda listening to Black Pink...', \"Not exactly in a convenient location, but it is definitely worth the drive to get there! Everything is automatically put in a to-go box so I recommend to order by phone ahead of time and pick it up at the drive-by window. There are a few tables that you can eat at inside and a couple outside, but you'll have to find parking. This small corner restaurant is very clean and well run. The sashimi is very fresh and cut well. Be aware that these are already marinated so it's not the traditional plain raw sashimi. I loved the salmon box with the ikura sprinkled on top!! The flavors were wonderful!  The Hamachi was marinated with lemon, which is not my personal preference, but my husband really liked it.  We are definitely making this one of our regular hotspots!\", \"Flavors were a little different from what I remembered but could be due to the absence of mixed veggies option or just an old man's memories. Food was ready 10min early, around  10min after ordering online and so was convenient for lunch when working from home. Might have to try the poke bowl next time to see how those are. It's nice to have some different options when there are 8 sandwich places in the neighborhood and feel like something different.\", 'I was disappointed in my sushi burrito. The description said snow crab but it was imitation ceab. I got the tempura and crab burrito and it costs $3 more too. Also the burrito was not cut in half even close to evenly which is difficult if you are going to share. I was on my way to SFO so no way to wait for another or check before heading out. I was disappointed. There was also a line out the door too and they were past the estimated wait for online orders. It does seem to be a popular spot so maybe others are having a better experience.', \"I ordered their Chicken Katsu Curry to go and it was great! The rice was perfectly cooked with great texture (this is v important), the chicken katsu was crisp but juicy, and the curry had a nice flavor and texture - though I wish it had more carrots and potatoes. They also add in some pickled vegetable - I couldn't tell what it was, maybe red pepper? But it was a good addition to the meal!\", \"Cute little corner cafe. Excited to visit due to good ratings and super cute corgi logo. I think they are opening up for indoor dining again though quite slowly. Food orders are mostly takeout/pick up. I got the mixed veggie curry plate but, again because they're not completely doing indoor dining, it came in a takeout box  . Nonetheless, it tasted fresh and hot and well seasoned! I recommend getting a croquette along with it. That was crisp and cooked perfectly. Food came out promptly too! They were nice enough to let me dine inside with my fur baby. If it's your first visit, check in on Yelp and get a free Thai tea bubble tea\", 'Solid curry and poke joint! Seems to be mostly to go orders. There is a kiosk in the from to order. There are only two tables and a small counter to sit at if you eat in. Everything is in to-go boxes regardless. The curry was delightfully sweet with a hint of spicy. A perfect meal for a rainy day!', \"Came here for a poke bowl but has been awhile since the last visit. If you don't order online prior to arriving, there's a stand with an iPad to order upon arriving. I figured there'd be a bit of employee interaction for questions but basically pointed us to the iPad only. Orders were ready relatively fast. There was no dining inside when we arrived. We both made our own bowls with ahi, salmon, and hamachi proteins and rice base. The ahi and hamachi didn't taste so fresh and texture wasn't the best either. The salmon would've been the way to go. The rice was also sort of clumped together and not the best. Flavor with the sauce was pretty good but a bit over sauced and just squeezed out on top. Food was decent but I don't feel the need to try again soon.\", \"I am in SF for business and I found Amitis Cafe on Yelp. Had some good reviews so had to try it. The ordering process was from a tablet at the door. The app was straight forward and easy to use when ordering. It took some time to get my order, not their fault as they had a large amount of orders coming in from delivery services. The employee was really nice and she apologized for the delay.I ordered a custom salmon poke bowl, the fish was really fresh and the flavoring of their sauces was good. I recommend if you're in the vicinity and have a crave for Poke come to this place you won't be disappointed.\", \"Amitis has really good sushi burritos!! My family has tried the hamanako burrito, dancing shrimp burrito, chicken karage, and the tonkatsu curry. All of the above are great!The gyu don is okay, I would pass next time and just go for the sushi burritos.They are pretty fast and I will definitely come back. It is pricey but I feel like that's what you have to expect for sushi/Japanese food.\", 'WOWOWOW!! first time trying and was SO impressed!! my cousin said he was ordering sushi, this is not your average sushi. so filling, so many great flavors, perfect ratio of fish to rice. loved and would rave about it to anyone looking for their sushi fix in the city!!', \"Katsu Curry in SF for less than $15?? Count me in!!This place has unbelievably good value, and tasty food. The curry is warm and slightly spicy, with crispy katsu over a bed of hot rice! The poke bowl is also starts at just $14, where you can get a bowl full of tuna and salmon.And don't forget to check in for a free Thai tea WITH boba!! My partner and I got our whole meal here (poke, katsu curry, and the free Thai tea) for just $33. I only wish I lived closer so I could come here all the time!\", 'This is possibly one of my new favorite poke spots in the city!Amitis is a small poke and curry shop where you can order quickly on your phone via QR code. Despite being takeout-only, there are a few tables outside of their cafe as well as a spacious park nearby.I got a custom bowl with salmon and ahi tuna on spring mix for ~$15, with tax included. Prices are really reasonable, the fish was super fresh, and the portion size was substantial! I highly recommend the fried shallots as a topping -- they are so crunchy and savory.They have a bunch of appealing pre-made bowls as options, but the custom bowl option is good for those of us who like a little more personalization. Would totally come back to try their other dishes!', \"Generous portions of tasty fish for a good price! I got the summer bowl for takeout with spring mix which was wonderful for a light lunch. The sauce is very tasty and isn't too strong, so it doesn't overpower the fish. I like how there are a few different fish included in the premade bowls, making the variety and amount you get very worth it! There are also some vegan options here which can normally be pretty difficult to find at a sushi place. If you're a big eater, I'd definitely recommend getting rice in your bowl instead of veggies!\", \"YUM! A good to-go spot for a quick bite if you're craving poke, sushi burritos, or Japanese style curry. The price isn't terrible for the quality of food and if you check-in on Yelp you also get a free thai tea with boba which was DELICIOUS! Most people order to-go although they do have a few tablets inside and outside. Overall, good experience!\", 'Great quality fish and toppings, but strangely a little stingy with the salad (generous with the fish though)! Also (not sure if this is because I ordered on Uber Eats), I wish half rice/half salad was an option as it is in most other poke places!', 'The food tastes very fresh. I love how much fish is in it! It is light in the rice which I prefer vs buying something that is all rice with very little fish. They were very kind and helpful, even helping me check in for the free boba. The boba is also great. Would highly recommend!', 'Ordered the salmon box to go. Was super high quality fish, delicious, and surprisingly affordable. To go presentation was really nice and held up well on the 15 min drive home. Will definitely be back to try their other options!', 'Great service and great burrito. My favorite in San Francisco. The fish is very fresh and drinks are the best', \"November 15th 2021 4pm I was craving sushi and found this place nearby Kaiser. It is currently only order at the door and takeout, no indoor seating. I didn't get to eat my sushi burrito until an hour later when I got home. I was super hungry since I hadn't eaten all day and was excited to finally dig in. The first half of the burrito I chose, I didn't realize most of the veggies were on that side and I ended up eating several mouthful of veggies first. Which isn't a complaint but I was caught off guard. Maybe it has to do with the way the burrito was cut diagonally and I ate the part that stuck out first. The burrito had enough salmon and tuna in it and all the fixings. But I felt like there could be more sauce mixed in as it tasted a little bland.\", 'I had a craving for a sushi burrito and found this place on google maps. It did not disappoint. I got the Chicago Fire burrito which was FIRE and they gave me a Thai tea! Amitis + Presidio views made for an epic lunch break. Will definitely be back again! :)', 'Excellent selection and service at this joint. Hugh quality fish and interesting presentation and flavors.', \"Tried this spot a few months ago...Pretty delicious offerings. All take outs at that time. This is a small restaurant. Also, I was a little disappointed that I didn't get to see the Corgi. I would go back and try other items.\", \"Food: I have always gotten the dancing shrimp burrito which has never failed to taste amazing!Service: They are very nice. I always use the kiosk to purchase my food and wait outside until they call my name. Ambiance: I have only eaten in their outdoor seating which is very nice when the sun is out. I enjoy the aesthetic and think it's a great place to grab a nice meal.\", 'Excellent poke bowls and friendly staff. Fast, great to go or dine in. Perfect place for lunch when I want to treat myself.

      "Reviews: ['The food were top-notch and has excellent quality.  I like the Vegan Lasagna and Pork cheeks which has nice flavor, it was well-cooked and it taste so fantastic. Everything was well-done.Amazing cocktail drinks. Lovely place, with good lighting, and nice seating inside. It was wonderful place with a pleasant ambiance. The staff were so friendly.', \"We went here for brunch. We sat on the back patio. They have heaters which is nice considering SF is often chilly. The ambience was nice.I ordered the quinoa brunch bowl. It was basically just a big bowl of dry quinoa. My friend ordered the same thing and made the comment she had almost no arugula in it. I think I had 1 piece of cauliflower. Supposedly it had a vinaigrette on it, but I felt it had absolutely no flavor. The worst part is I had hard egg shell in my dish. Thankfully the restaurant took this dish off our bill to compensate, but it kind of ruined the whole meal for me. My husband got the Media Noche Sandwich. He liked it, and I had half and thought it was fine. The dishes are pretty large. Pricing is about $40/couple. I didn't feel very excited about anything on the menu, and probably will not return.\", \"Fable is my go to. It never disappoints for a date night, from the food to the wine selection everything here is on point. This is my go to for every date night because me and my partner always leave pleased. The servers are always friendly and well mannered. Service and food matter and finding a favorite restaurant is hard. This place deserves a A + for effort and I'll always be a loyal customer. Would I recommend- Absolutely\", \"Fable came a bit short of my expectations, unfortunately. The patio for brunch needs to be reserved way in advance, so I wasn't able to check it out, but the parklet in the front was lovely too. I like how this place places a great emphasis on outdoor dining! Service was quite slow. It seems like there were only about two people working, during weekend brunch hours. It took us a long time to get seated even though I noticed that there were vacant tables. The brunch menu was quite limited, and I was disappointed that there wasn't a vegetarian omelet or scramble dish. I ended up getting the chilaquiles, even though that wasn't quite what I was in the mood for at the time. The chilaquiles were good, but I think that if there were more menu options to choose from, I would have had a better experience.\", 'Sammy and Wine   On my day trip to The Castro area of SF, we started with a small bite and afternoon splash.  Waitress was helpful in picking best of the sandwiches (her favorite was the turkey). Perfect focaccia bread, toasted turkey, meaty cheese, smooth avocado  paired the Sammy with a bottom of white wine and could not be happier.  We got sat in the back courtyard and let me tell you about serene. It was cozy with an open roof to the sky.  Beautiful. Will be back for lunch again tomorrow', \"I came here for brunch with a friend in their backyard patio. It was decorated with vibrant colors, definitely a vibe, and it also got pretty hot from the greenhouse effect of their roof as it was a rare sunny day in SF this July. The server was great with refilling our water.I got a generous portion of perfectly runny Eggs Benedict with crispy potatoes, and my friend got the Fried Chicken Sandwich (not pictured) with a margarita. Would love to come back when I'm not hungover to try their cute drinks!\", 'We came here for a work dinner and sat in the patio.The patio was an unexpected pretty oasis in the middle of the inner city.Service was delightful.We had a prefix menu and I got the steak, which was done perfectly. The macaroni and cheese side was delicious. I also really enjoyed their melon salad.We brought our own alcohol, which was nice. Not sure if we were charged a corkage fee. It was a lovely evening and I would definitely return on my own.', \"Note: If you're looking at the hours on here, they're incorrect. They're open for brunch everyday except for Sat & Sun from 11:30 am to 3 pm and dinner everyday from 5 pm to 10 pm! Happy hour 3 pm to 6 pm.Okay, let's get into it.. food was alright! The oven roasted chicken was good, nothing that was a wow factor but good and did the job! Loved the focaccia bread that it came on! The double cheeseburger is on the smaller side and cooked about medium! Same thing, wasn't a wow factor but didn't dislike it either. Fries came out perfectly hot and crispy! Service was great. Open seating on a Thursday in their back patio. Loved the lushness in the back and how happy it made you feel! Great ambience for a day out with friends or a day date!\", \"This nice place to go on a Sunday for brunch. They have plenty of seating outdoors, so you don't have to wait long. They are attentive and offer proper service. The food was delicious. I got the salmon with  greens. There was plenty of it too. Make sure your entire party is there before seating. I will be coming back.\", 'My friends and I booked a large table in the back of Fable on a Friday night. It was ideal to eat as a group - they did ask us to place our orders all at once. They have a cute backyard with heat lamps, which you would never know from the street looking at the storefront.I got the pan roasted Rocky Jr chicken, which I give 4/5 stars. The chicken was tender and perfectly cooked and the salad was luscious and full of delicious plums, apricots, and homemade croutons. The chicken was not super flavorful but overall a great dish.Two of my friends got the vegan lasagna which I tried - it came with a spicy red sauce, delicious noodles with bits of zucchini and vegan cheese crumble on top. Personally, I think the sauce had a little too much pepper/salt but my non-Italian friends both loved it. Would definitely recommend for vegans. My other friend got the pan seared salmon with quinoa and absolutely adored it.Lastly there is the mac and cheese, which is so hard to find in the Bay Area. The whole table adored this side dish, which was topped with Parmesan cheese. As a mac and cheese aficionado, I would come back just for this.', 'No Fees', 'Quick and helpful servers. Enjoyed the brussel sprouts, vegan lasagna, and swordfish the most.', 'Had a fun and delicious brunch here with friends over pride weekend! I had the omelette with artichokes and veggies, and we all shared a carafe of sangria. The food and drinks were delicious.We were also seated on an outdoor patio that was very bright and pretty. Definitely loved the space too.', \"I hadn't been to Fable in a long time and was back again recently. The first time was great and had gotten the pork chop. This time I got the mussels. Portion was big, bread that came with it was also filling, and mussels and broth were flavorful. We tried the chocolate dessert and strawberry shortcake. The shortcake texture was light and not heavy or dry. The filling/strawberries were soft and good balance. The chocolate was light and not overly sweet which I appreciated. We sat on the back patio which is really cute and had heat lamps. Our server checked on us and was patient as we were slow to order. Definitely recommend and hope to come back sooner than last time\", 'This place is a really wonderful spot to grab wine, cocktails, or dinner in the Castro.  There is a wonderful courtyard in the middle with a tiki feel that adds to the chill vibe of the place.  The menu is very good and vegetarian friendly, and there are non-alcoholic wines and cocktails in addition to the fully-leaded variety.  Highly recommended.', 'Not bad but not amazing either. The food is okay. I had the breakfast sandwich (egg and cheese) and it fell apart. Not much flavor. Server kind of interrupted our conversations a lot but I understand she had a job to do. We were on the back porch in a place people were coming in and out and the ground was uneven. Staff kept smacking into us or tripping on the uneven pavement. Not my favorite brunch spot.', 'Visited for Saturday brunch. We had made advance reservations so we were seated soon after arrival.Our order:- mimosa - very good- Chilaquiles - good- Veggie omelette - good- Chocolate chip banana bread - okayishOverall, we liked the food and the staff was very friendly. The garden-like ambience of their outdoor patio is great and also very dog friendly. I can see myself visiting again for trying out other items on their menu.', \"Grilled local rock cod tacos were delicious. The fish meat was steaming warm and filling, and the flavors were on point. The citrus and endive salad with roasted pistachio vinaigrette (with crab meat add-on!) was great too. The salad was light, refreshing, and flavorful, and as a non-SF local, I was really impressed with how fresh the crab meat was. I'm really glad we decided to add the crab meat--I think it's definitely a must-get!The outdoor patio environment is really cute, but one con: it's very noisy. Very cute spot for a date if you don't mind talking loudly/straining to listen to other people. Either that or learn some ASL :)\", 'Overall Experience: 5Food: 5Service: 5Atmosphere: 5Value: depends Pros: The serving sizes for our entrees were HUGE. Definitely more than enough food. Also, the mussels appetizer is such a good deal and so delicious. The flavors of the appetizers and entrees were spot on and included some very interesting ingredients! The atmosphere of the outdoor dining space was super adorable and made for the perfect romantic date night. Cons: The stuffed fish was around $36 and although it was good, this is pretty pricey compared to their other menu items. The bathroom also felt a little dirty. Their desserts were not the best in my opinion and were far pricier than their other menu items. If I were to come here again, I would definitely skip the dessert menu.', 'Super cute outdoor dining area.  Food was good and service was also good. Nice spot for a date night.', 'Service  Food Ambiance  Food was cool & portions acceptable, staff service or front desk attendant was publicly rude to myself and my friends with seating.', 'No Fees', \"Looked up popular brunch spots in the area and saw this one. Decided to give it a try and it did not disappoint. Patio seating was lovely. It does get hot, and awnings don't cover the whole space. Service was helpful. Had the fennel cured trout eggs benedict, eggplant caponata omelette with breakfast potatoes, fable's sweet baguette french toast, and mimosas. Favorites were the french toast (caramelized peaches which were not too sweet) and eggs benedict! Food wasn't mindblowing but everything was cooked well and flavored nicely.Cured trout eggs benedict: $22Eggplant caponata omelette with breakfast potatoes: $15Fable's sweet baguette french toast: $16Mimosa: $35\", \"Fable is in the Castro.  I went there with my wife and some friends for brunch. We didn't have a reservation and showed up right when they opened, so understandably they seated reservations first, but we were able to get a table, the manager said he could make it work if we ate and left within an hour because they had another reservation scheduled.We sat in their outdoor covered patio which was really nice and pretty sturdy, it was raining while we were there and we were dry as a bone.Our server recommended their chocolate banana bread which was super yummy, I love how banana and zucchini breads for example have so much sugar in them that probably evens out at health content the fruits or veggies had. I really enjoyed the Fried Chicken Sandwich and their fries were pretty good too. I'd try it again, maybe make a reservation next time.\", \"Went for brunch and the service was great! If you have a reservation, you'll need to make sure most of your party is there because they won't give you the table otherwise. They hold reservations for 10 minutes only. Our server was great! The restaurant has a backyard and it's perfect for a sunny day in the city. It has plants and has a great ambiance. The space has heaters.The food was great too. We ordered the dishes below and would definitely recommend for brunch:- chilaquiles- egg sandwich- quinoa boal- grapefruit juice\", 'The ambience is just incredible at this cute brunch spot. Loved my Chilaquiles which is high praise because I usually find this dish too tomato-y. This one was perfectly done and topped with a fluffy egg and cheese. Sangria was super strong as well!', 'I had lunch here a few weeks ago and it was great. The patio here was calm and quiet. It was nice to sit and relax for a late afternoon bite.I loved the attentive service and chill ambience.', \"Holiday weekend & all the restaurants were packed. Wandering around the Castro looking for a late lunch and saw Fable. I wasn't sure about this place cause nobody was in the parklet & it looked so dark inside. Who knew, there's an awesome outdoor patio in back. That's where everyone was. I noticed a lot of wine & beer day drinking, hence, the merry mood.Loved the setting, large overhead, vine covered trellis, lots of light. I ordered my twice a year hamburger- so going all the way with the 1/2 lb double cheeseburger, side of fries. Man, so delicious, the fries were crispy & lightly salted. The burger was dripping cheese, elevated with dill pickle, lettuce, & tomato. I skipped the aioli, cause, yuck. My friend got the Caesar with added chicken. He didn't like the chicken, turned off cause the strips were green. I guess he doesn't like pesto & regretted he didn't get the fried chicken salad, which he enjoyed last time.We were given a large carafe of water and iced black tea refills.With tip we paid about $75. Yipes. But I will definitely come back on a nice day & sit in the outdoor patio.\", 'Picked Fable for a birthday brunch with a group of 10 because it was one of the few brunch places in SF I could find that accepted reservations.The back patio is pretty cute, and though it was rainy we were completely covered and dry. The menu has a range of options for various tastes/preferences and everyone seemed to enjoy the food. We shared the banana bread and enjoyed it, and I was very full/satisfied after eating my fried chicken sandwich.Service was nice/friendly as well!', \"The restaurant itself is beautiful and super pretty, and the service is great. The fondue was good, would've preferred thicker chips or a heavier fondue, it was pretty watery. The chicken was great in my opinion, cooked really well and loved the filling. I would order again. The jerk pork shank seemed more braised than anything, and we were not told ahead of time that they were out of brussel sprouts and pancetta, which is part of why the dish was ordered versus another. It was a hearty portion which was nice. The halibut was the least flavorful and not a favorite.\", \"Although I've heard many good things about brunch here I've never been for brunch. We did go for dinner yesterday and had a great dining experience. The food was very delicious with a very delightful ambience and environment. We had dinner in the rear garden, which is very nice. They also have some tables on the street which I can imagine are nice as well, but they're not as elegant or entertaining. We had the muscles which were done perfectly ask for extra bread. Make sure to make reservations\", 'Love this place, great food, service. Love the garden.  A favorite brunch spot for us.', 'No Fees', 'Fable always has great food and ambiance. The service is impeccable. If you can, request a table in the back patio. Make sure you try one of their daily specials. Also they allow dogs in the patio, so your furry friends are welcome here.', \"I had a wonderful 2nd experience at Fable. The first time I came for brunch a few months ago. Both times we had excellent service.Today, my partner arrived 10 minutes early and the host was very kind. He had asked if we had reservations (we did not), but very kindly let us know that they'd be open shortly. Once the outdoor back patio was ready, he came and got us from out front of the restaurant. By the way, if you ever have the option to eat indoors or out in the back patio...GO TO THE PATIO! It's beautifully set with seating surrounded by greenery and covered in shade. The first time I came here it was lightly raining and it was BEAUTIFUL to sit out there and listen to the rain while eating. Today was a Thursday and by 6pm, the restaurant was filling quickly. Might be best to make reservations. Just in case. I want to highlight the host for a second in hopes that the manager sees this. He sat an elderly couple next to us and was EXTREMELY patient and kind. The elderly woman had accidentally knocked over the seat cushion from the bench. She was using a cane to walk with and couldn't get it from the floor herself. He helped get it back from behind the bench and placed it for her. It was just a very genuine act of human kindness and was pleased to see the great employees they hire here.Now...for the food. Oh. My. Goodness. The waiter suggested we try the Roasted Maitake, King Trumpet & Pink Oyster Mushroom Toast. It was full of flavor and beautifully plated. We also ordered the 12 oz Grilled NY Strip Steak and the Pan Seared Alaskan Halibut. Everything was cooked to perfection. One thing I love about this place is that the menu seems to change which is great for variety. I can't wait to come back again and try something new!\", \"Our group of three came here for Sunday brunch and were able to be seated outside in the parklet immediately. Note that the back patio is only available by reservation. For food, I had a steak benedict. I loved how the egg and steak were served on top of focaccia. It was tasty and not too heavy. The chocolate chip banana bread was a nice sweet treat as well. I got a iced coffee, which felt a bit watered down for my taste. The outside parklet was cute, and I loved the plant theme throughout the restaurant. Our server was friendly, and the food came out quickly.  I later realized that we were incorrectly charged extra for part of our order, so I left a voicemail with the restaurant. I didn't hear back after a few days, so I called again and was put in touch with the manager who quickly corrected the charge which I really appreciated!\", 'It\\'s all about the backyard.  On a sparkling sunny day following the season\\'s 11th atmospheric river, Fable\\'s backyard patio was the place to be.  With my party of 8, we walked through the restaurant\\'s interior to emerge in the backyard space and I heard audible gasps of joy from some in my group who were surprised in the best of ways.  The backyard space is a charmer.As a Castro Street regular who is generally dining solo while in the area, Fable has never risen to the top of my list.  It seems more of a splurge place than a solo dining spot but I\\'m happy to report that the splurge is very reasonable considering 2023 restaurant prices.  Here, meal-sized salads, burgers, and other menu items can be had at lunch for under $20.  This was a most pleasant surprise given the surroundings and the fact that Fable is a full-service restaurant.  I didn\\'t take a poll, but my hunch - based on my personal experience - is that the backyard is the reason you go here and the food is nice accompaniment.  My Cobb Salad ($18) was well composed and hosted a satisfying array of fresh, quality ingredients.  At my table, all food was consumed but we failed to reach the \"ooh\" and \"aah\" of truly memorable food; that was reserved for the setting.  I was happily pleased with Fable.  The reason to enjoy a meal there is the opportunity to sit in that attractive, leafy, green backyard.  The meal is your price of admission.', 'Loved the patio! I just wished they had music there too. The food was delicious, and service was great.', \"Meh. Very pleasant patio and nice service. But the tap water had a really odd taste, which added about $10 in bottled substitutes to our tab. The fried chicken in the sandwich was greasy and the Caesar salad we split was tasty but not like any Caesar dressing I've ever had - more a mustard vinaigrette. For $78 pre-tip, I would not return.\", 'Ive been excited to come to Fable for some time since they take reservations and have a beautiful patio! I had made reservations for 2 on the weekend, and we were seated on the patio. The menu online had shown lattes and other coffees, but when we asked the server we were told they only had straight espresso. I had asked if they could pour it over ice and bring a side of almond milk but was told no. I found that to be very odd.I ordered the omelette, it was over cooked and covered in salsa (not mentioned on the menu). The potatoes were also covered in so much seasoning it was all I could taste on the plate. My friend had ordered the French toast, she said it was good but nothing special and the way it was served was hard to eat. If I was in the area, I would give Fable another try but unfortunately I was not impressed with my first visit.', 'Make reservations!While we awaited the opening, a few people strolled. by and mentioned that this is one of the best restaurants on the Castro.We sat on the beautiful outdoor garden patio next to a trickling fountain.  We ordered the peaches with housemade ricotta, NY steak, .and a cheeseburger. The starter of peaches and housemade ricotta was innovative and memorable.Our burger was brought with cheese (we had asked without), but while they corrected it, we devoured the steak, which was delicious. The Au gratin potatoes were especially good. The burger was fairly pedestrian.', 'The red quinoa bowl - served warm - is delicious and surprisingly filling. The \"not so skinny\" Paloma is deceiving. At first I couldn\\'t taste the alcohol. But half an hour later it hit me hard!They have one of the prettiest patios in San Francisco. Brunch for 4, plus 2 drinks - $130 before tax and tip.', \"Love a good brunch and this spot was perfect for a sunday brunch with our group of 5. We had a reservation and I love that they do take reservations when many places don't!Food was good, not my most favorite though! Most notable options were the egg sandwich and the friend chicken sandwich. So yummy! Pro Tip: Def add an egg to the chicken sandwich!Coffee selection is limited to just hot or cold coffee - but drink selections looked amazing!! There's a 75min table limit depending on the line for brunch, so be aware if you plan to just hang for a while.Also HUGE plus is their patio is pet friendly!!

      "Reviews: [\"This spot is up there for one of the best Thai spots in SF. It's also run by a family, and you can tell they really care about the quality of both the food and their service.Every dish we had was packed with flavor and consisted of delicious, high-quality ingredients. It was clear from every bite that the chefs put a lot of care and attention into the dishes served.One of the aunties told us that their cooking comes from a central region in Thailand, where the spice level lies somewhat in the middle of the North and South's. Personally, I found that the dishes we ordered did have a pleasant middle heat.We will 100% be coming back!\", \"Best new Thai restaurant in SF! I love love love Thai food and have been itching for a new spot since Farmhouse Thai is hard to get to from Marin. This new spot blew our group of five away - they took a day-of reservation no problem (we called in to get the larger group at the right time as opentable was limited), were flexible when we were running 15 mins late, and had lovely, attentive service. With a great spread for both vegetarians and meat lovers, Oraan felt authentic but still approachable. We shared three appetizers and a papaya salad, and each ordered an entree - we left pleasantly stuffed with leftovers. The Christmas decorations and overall ambiance were cozy and added to the vibe. Can't wait to come back soon!\", \"So glad we came here! My fiancé and I came on a Friday night. We got seated immediately. Service was great, the servers were tentative. We ordered the fried chicken, papaya salad, pad Thai and the sukho Thai noodle. Everything was delicious. The papaya salad was medium spicy and just gave the perfect kick. The fried chicken was fried to perfection. The key lime cream on top was delicious and paired perfectly with the fried chicken. Similarly with the fried kale. Entree: the paid Thai and the sukho was good too. Both tasted yummy however the pad Thai was a bit sweet. I did crave a bit more spiciness. The decor was nice on the inside. Gave Christmas and festive vibes. They have a great selection of food. So we can't wait to come back!\", \"Last minute dinner spot that I thought was delicious and worth visiting again for a special occasion (you can find cheaper Thai food in the city). I appreciated the unique items on the menu. I chose an appetizer as my main meal and was happy I did. The gai manow was a fried chicken topped with a citrus sauce. I've never had anything like it and I'm glad I gave it a shot. I'd go back just for this. Ginger rice was a great side to go with the dish.\", 'Upon recommendations, we made dinner reservations for last Friday night at Orran. Parking right out front for convenience. We were greeted when we walked in and noticed many small tables in a cozy, intimate setting. I would say the service was the best! We were asked if we had questions about the menu, we were given instructions on what dip goes good with the food and definitely was checked up on several times throughout dinner. The menu had appetizers, soups, salads, entrees, noodles/rice and dessert. It had a lot of typical main Thai dishes you would normally recognize. I ordered the Hoi Jor which is the deep fried crab meet with pork and plum sauce. I also ordered the chicken Thai Fried Rice. The chicken in the fried rice had a hard texture, not my favorite. Lastly, we shared the Gal Himmaparn which is crispy fried chicken with cashews, bell peppers, basil and onions. All dishes arrived together and quick quickly actually! I was hoping the appetizer would come out first so we can enjoy a bite first before the entrees. Either way, it was the quickest cooking ever! Good Thai style food, authentic, fresh and good flavors. A good spot for dinner if you are craving thai flavors.', \"The place was nicely-decorated and each table had a candle. The staff were very welcoming and helpful with ordering since we couldn't decide what to get. Many of the dishes were new to us and not the typical dishes at most Thai restaurants. We ordered: - Gal Manow: wow the outside layer was super crunchy and the chicken was moist. The sauce was tart and creamy, with a slight sour aftertaste. Even if you don't like sour foods, I would def recommend trying this dish bc the flavors are well-balanced and you barely taste the sourness. The fried Chinese broccoli was similar to seaweed and a great crunchy addition to the dish.- Sukho Thai Noodle: I mostly got this one bc of the variety of meats and toppings with the noodles. The pork belly kept its crunchiness, even though it was a bit wet from the soup. The noodles were cooked well, not overcooked. The soup was a bit sour and spicy, very delicious. Wish it came with a bit more noodles though. Overall, this place is delicious and the friendly staff made the experience even better! I will come back to try other traditional Thai dishes and would def recommend this place!\", \"I'm blown away with how delicious this Thai spot is. The parking around this area may be troublesome but it is well worth the trip. Servers greeted my boyfriend and I right away and we got promptly seated.The noodle soup (5/5) the noodles were perfectly cooked and the broth was umami and packed with flavor. The different variations of pork offered each bite a new texture and flavor which made this dish even more enjoyable.Tom Kha (5/5) Sweet, sour and creamy. Can't go wrong with this soup.Thai ice tea with coconut milk (4/5) The thai tea itself was delicious but I would probably not get it with the coconut milk next time. The concoction was foreign to me and didn't fit my palate.Not only is the food good, the portion size is humongous. I can't wait to come back to try the other dishes they have to offer.\", 'My new local Thai Restaurant! The KAPOW MOO KROB is delicious!   And generous portion of the Coconut Ice Cream', \"You need to try this place! I am almost compelled to say this is my FAVORITE Thai restaurant in the city. The prices are very reasonable for San Francisco. The dishes are unique, high quality, and large. The service has a hint of the welcoming and sweet hospitality you get in Thailand. All around a solid new Thai restaurant in San Francisco that I think the city desperately needs. In terms of dishes, everything we order was out of this world. The Gai Manow was so crispy and the tart lemon cream sauce paired well with the crispy greens. I have never heard of a dish like this before, but it is definitely a must try when you come to this restaurant. The Sukho Thai Noodle was PACKED with various meats and the crispy pork was SO CRISPY. I would come back to this restaurant just for that! The Nuer Marakot and Laab were solid dishes as well. Not as stand out as the first two but the Nuer Marakot is a great dish if you are looking for a solid beef dish and the Laab Gai is a great starter with great fresh ingredients. As I said before, service was great! Servers were super friendly, super attentive about filling our water, and made the experience so great. Since the restaurant is fairly new, it was very easy to get a reservation at 7pm on a Wednesday evening -- hopefully things get packed and busy for them soon. You can easily make a reservation on OpenTable. Ambiance was super laid back as well. The restaurant is decorated very nicely (think BoHo Thai modern) and have a bright welcoming reception environment. It's a great place for a first date or a nice dinner with friends. I had heard from a server they were able to accommodate a party of 20 a couple days ago. Mark my words, YOU NEED TO TRY THIS PLACE!!!! You won't regret it.\", 'One of the best Thai experience I\\'ve had! Because it\\'s not only the food, but the whole experience with this new restaurant is what all Thai restaurants should aspire to be. Ambiance, aesthetic, presentation were all top notch.This is a top class operation.The menu is quite comprehensive and diverse. From the young papaya salad to fruit salad to deep fried battered chicken served with lemon cream sauce (Gai Manow) to crudités of raw vegetables served with coconut dipping sauce (Lon Kung).This evening I\\'ve had a delicious Thai style longan juice beverage which was refreshing with fresh longan fruits, mint leaves and hint of brown sugar. I also had the \"Som tum pon la mai\" fruit salad, it was vibrant, sweet, sour, fresh, nutty, crunchy, fish sauce, explosion of flavor, you will love this!For my main course I\\'ve had \"Nuer Marakot\" which is marinated beef with Thai eggplants. Wow! Fatty, meaty, bold, complex, the Thai eggplants are cooked but still crunchy and the bamboo shoots are such great compliment to this dish. You like Thai green curry? You WILL LOVE this dish!I really wanted to try their mango and sticky rice dessert, but I was so full.Maybe next week or maybe tomorrow, I like this place so that is for sure.Aesthetically pleasing to the eyes from the ambience, utensils down to the food presentation.Service was great, the staff actually approach and attempt to have a conversation with you / the customers, unlike many other typically Thai restaurants staff who are either too shy or not really talking to their customers.I would recommend this restaurant highly to my colleagues (even to my Thai friends at work) and my hotel clients.This place is one of the restaurant where I would happily spend my money at.', \"New Thai restaurant. Food and service is very good. Well, the pad tai is a bit too sweet for me. The rest of the items are very good but very strong flavor. You cannot eat the food on its own. You will need to eat it with white rice. My favorite is the appetizer fried crispy chicken with sauce on top and their A La carte  fried crispy shrimp with tamarin is really good. The shrimp is so crispy that you literally can eat the whole shell too. Which we did. Overall we all enjoyed our meal. One last note, it's not cheap but good to try once in a while.\", 'Welcome new addition to the Thai food scene in the Inner Richmond. So many new and unusual dishes to choose from. Of the three dishes we ordered, only tom ka gai soup was familiar. The soup was loaded with white meat chicken, fabulous mushrooms, and a rich coconut broth--too much for the two of to finish. Another tasty dish was a deconstructed salad with a shrimp and pepper spread that could be smeared on lettuce and cabbage leaves and adorned with carrots and cucumbers. The final dish was pork four ways: pork shoulder, roast pork, ground pork, and grilled pork belly in a somewhat spicy brown sauce over rice vermicelli noodles. If you are looking for a unique Thai experience, give Oraan a try.', 'I love Thai food and always up for checking out new places. I finally tried Oraan Thai after passing by so many times. The authentic Thai food here was absolutely delicious and beautifully presented using Thai ingredient herbs for decorations. The service was the warmest hospitality. This place such a chill spot , nice and relaxing to catch up with friends, the ambience is great not too loud like any others.I enjoyed Kung Makam ( the crunchy prawns with tamarind sauce) and Hormokbaitong ( steam mixed seafood in red curry sauce.Menu choices very interesting and unique. I would highly recommend this restaurant.', \"We came here after a great Thai massage 5 blocks away. We are keeping the theme Thai today!And Oraan Thai did not disappoint. We started with the Curry Puffs for appetizers as recommended by the wait staff. The crust is perfect in texture with a very slight sweetness to it. The filling was tasty and plentiful. The curry sauce to dip it in complemented the crust and filling perfectly.The Spicy Pork Ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender and very delicious! They provide you plastic gloves for the ribs. I wasn't sure if it was because it would be fiery like Korean chicken or because it was messy. Turns out it's messy but still medium spicy. The Vegetable Curry was yummy, the sauce delectable. I had the Butterfly Pea Strawberry Lemonade and hubby had the Thai coffee.The service was excellent. The employees are very attentive, friendly, helpful. They are great at topping off your water glass which is great as some dishes are spicy. The ambiance is perfect for a date or family oriented. It is spacious and clean, very nicely decorated. This restaurant was formerly Mescolanza.  We enjoyed our experience here quite a lot, the food is very good. We will definitely return.\", \"23.09.23.

They checked in with us, and asked a lot of feedback on their dishes, which we let them know were a 10/10. We left dinner feeling full and knowing this is now our favorite Thai spot!I super recommend getting the crispy pork belly and the fried chicken appetizer with the crispy Chinese broccoli! We couldn't stop thinking about those dishes when we left. This is a neighborhood gem for sure.\", 'The food is very delicious. It has a clean atmosphere and the employees are very friendly. I believe this was an Italian restaurant before. First of all, the food tastes good, so I recommend it.I ate the food recommended by the server and it was a very good choice.', \"The best fruit salad I've ever had. If you want to wake up, please try this one. I ate it with fried eggplants, which are also popular here.\", \"New, bright Thai spot on Geary near Arguello with excellent service and fresh, delicious food.  The smoked salmon/avappetizer was the perfect start to a wonderful lunch of crispy pork belly and pad see shrimp.  Don't miss the sticky rice and mango\", \"Beautiful interior, calming music, and friendly staff.Enjoyed everything we ordered:1. Curry puffs - Abundantly filled. Flaky on the outside, soft on the inside. Paired with a mild peanut sauce and a refreshing cucumber relish. The cucumber relish was not too sweet or sour.2. Nuer Marakot - Never had this dish before, and learned  that green curry has more of a kick. The beef was tender and flavorful. Eggplant and other vegetables in the dish were delicious. I appreciated the portion of this dish.3. Sukho Thai Noodle - Loved all the flavor this soup noodle had to offer. It's sweet, sour, and just opens up your appetite. The roast pork was very crunchy. But my favorite part is the soup. I would love just a bowl of noodles and this soup haha.\", 'Wonderful food, amazing service and beautiful decor. Oraan looks like a hole in the wall from the outside. But inside it is modern and simply beautiful. We ordered all appetizers and they were massive portions and delish! Our favorite by far was the Gai Manow (Crispy battered chicken, smothered in a creamy citrus sauce) I would describe it like a fluffy chicken nugget with the perfect cream sauce.Staff was kind and attentive. I will absolutely be coming back here.', \"My partner and I dined here last evening, what a pleasant experience in service and flavors!The servers were attentive without hovering.We started with the fruit salad and were amazed by the complexity of flavor coupled with sweet and spicy finishes. I had the Pad See Eew (I've been looking for a replacement ever since Derm changed hands) I was not disappointed! absolutely spot on and a large portion. My Partner had the Pad Thai, says it's the best he's ever had and again a large portion.

      "Reviews: [\"It was so good that we forgot to take photos!No, seriously. My kiddo who doesn't like any cheese except mozzarella gobbled my order of grilled cheese and wanted another. The avocado toast here has become our new gold standard for avocado toast.  Hubby is still thinking about it after a few weeks -- that's how good it is.  The eggs were done perfectly and complemented each sandwich perfectly. The breakfast croissant sandwich was excellent too. Service was excellent and the collection of kaleidoscopes kept all of us busy while waiting. The patience the owner had for us, esp. with our 7 yr old kiddo was amazing.  The decor was comfy, intimate, and comfortable. The dinner menu looked really good too.  Worth a stop and try out\", \"The food here was pretty good - above average. Everything was tasty and well presented. I especially liked the rooibos latte. The staff was friendly. In my ratings I weight the the food itself above everything else. So they get positive ratings on food taste and presentation.However, the reason I gave 3/5 stars: I found the portions to be unusually small, and the price is unusually high, even for a normal sized portion. This combo made the breakfast not worth it, so I will not be a repeat customer. For reference, a lavendar latte (milk and lavendar) was approximately $8, and $2 extra to add espresso. The rooibos tea latte (also without coffee) was also $8. These should be cheap ingredients and I don't think a latte should be more than $6.50 with espresso. I would certainly eat here frequently if the price were more reasonable/normal OR the portions were significantly bigger.*Edited for conciseness\", 'Found this quaint little spot while waiting for our morning appointment. We had two pomegranate mimosas and a side of bacon $45. We sat at the counter height along the window. Both mimosas and bacon were delicious and perfect little morning break. The rest of the menu items look amazing and I should try to come back again.', \"Quick Summary:- Wonderful ambience - Indoor and outdoor seating available- Beautiful food presentation- Tea is from Blue Willow Teashop While looking for places to eat, we discovered this new place on Divisadero. The uploaded photos were so appealing to the eyes; like little jewels. This was a must visit, so we went to see what it is like.We were welcomed by staff and they asked us to sit wherever we like. We chose inside and near the window, where the tables are set as bars. Water was first served, and it comes in a cup with their logo. I love the details in this restaurant with their branding. I also loved the check booklet, with the logo on it.We ordered different orders: the breakfast sandwich, BLT, grilled cheese sandwich, matcha latte, and the latte from the Painted Ladies selection. (Actually I realized that the matcha latte is also from the Painted Ladies section). The latte of the one I got is blue colored. Compared to the matcha latte, the milk is slightly blue in hue, but it is hard to tell at first glance. The more I drank though, the blue color started to come out. The blue doesn't apply flavor to the coffee, so it was easy to drink.After the hot drinks, the sandwiches arrived one after another, and all of them are dressed so pretty! They were fit for taking photos. Not only the presentation was gorgeous, the taste was really really good! The tomato sweet, flavorful and juicy with the dash of salt and pepper. The eggs was cooked just right; slightly melting too! Magically, it tastes like it has another layer of flavor, like bacon or ham, but nope. The seasoning in this breakfast sandwich is wonderful.The staff is attentive and sweet as well. They came by the bar corner and checked in from time to time.On the way out, we saw one of the guests had their tea in cute teapots. Next time when we visit here again, we will also try ordering a teapot of tea. I'm a fan of Blue Willow Teaspot too.\", \"I was a bit underwhelmed by this place after reading all the great reviews. We really enjoyed the outdoor seating. The menu is very simple and limited. The service was very nice. We tried the jam and toast. I was hoping a place with the word Jam in the title would deliver the best jam experience I've ever had, but it was very simple jam on forgettable toast. Nothing noteworthy. The breakfast sandwiches were just ok. Very eggy without a ton of flavor. The bread was good. But I've had much better breakfast sandwiches in the city elsewhere.\", \"The food here is presented beautifully, clearly crafted with meticulous care. Elevating our experience, the chef personally hand-delivered our dishes with a warm and genuine smile. You can tell the owners really care about making customers happy.I opted for the Salmon Niçoise, a dish that has always held a special place in my heart! Here, it was executed to another level, the salmon cooked juuuust how I like it, tender and succulent, not the slightest bit dry. Accompanied by a golden boiled egg, the freshest of greens artfully arranged around the bowl, and brought together with a classic vinaigrette. Probably the prettiest Niçoise I've ever seen. These folks really get that you eat with your eyes as much as your mouth.This spot is perfect for a weekend lunch or brunch. I will definitely be returning.\", \"Starting off - the service here is amazing! You are VERY taken care of the whole time.The food options may seem a little simple but wow are the flavors actually insane! The avo toast with ricotta is something I'm going to be dreaming about for a very long time.It's not too overhyped as other brunch places either, we came on a Saturday morning ~9am and wasn't any wait. Definitely add this spot to your must try list!!\", \"ORDERS: Avocado Toast + Salmon | Salmon Salade Niçoise | Dual Grilled Cheese | Summer Corn + Ricotta Quiche | Tomato + Bacon + Herb Quiche | Blue Majik Latte | Golden Turmeric Latte | Red Rooibos LattePROUD CONFESSION - this is my friend & her husband's restaurant and omfg it is so so so so SO amazing!!!! I had the pleasure of trying bites, sips & full entrees of many items during my last SF visit and almost stayed an additional week because I couldn't get enough. The food and drinks are all incredible because they're locally and sustainably sourced, then expertly prepared by the meticulously magical chef Mark & his awesome kitchen team.Front of house boasts a fabulous team as well, (led by my girl Nadia!) serving beautiful food & bevvies with smiles on their faces. I had the pleasure of bussing for a day, so you may have seen me out there doing my best & having an absolute blast!!Such great vibes, super clean, beautifully decorated interiors & gorgeous outdoor patio seating annnndddd LIVE MUSIC!!! Can't recommend enough!!! xoxoxooxoxo!!\", 'Imagine a freshly baked, buttery croissant with flaky layers lovingly enveloping a breakfast sandwich brimming with delectably rich fillings.This\\'s the best breakfast sandwich that I\\'ve had in San Francisco Bay Area Reopened after the pandemic, this neighborhood brunch restaurant \"That\\'s My Jam\" made a beautiful comeback! Wonderful service, friendly staff, and nice ambiance, too!!', \"Think crunchy, packed with umami goodness, and the right touch of saltiness. It's safe to say that the grilled cheese was the best I've had for a San Francisco brunch. It's a comfort food classic that's hard to beat. Our waiter was not only efficient but also incredibly friendly while introducing the specials of the day!However, the menu itself is relatively short and straightforward. The portions were on the smaller typical brunch-sized end, but what sets this place apart is the beautiful, delicate presentation for each dish. Clearly lots of fresh sustainable ingredients were thoughtfully integrated in the sides and salads. It's a charming spot where you can enjoy a quick bite with a little extra flair.\", \"It doesn't look like much when you drive by because it doesn't seem to have a visible sign but when we finally found it, we were pleasantly surprised! Came here for a quick breakfast on a rainy Sunday morning with a friend and we were immediately seated inside! There was no wait, the interior is very cute, and the kind waitress gave us her recommendations/her favorites!We ordered their Breakfast Sandwiches as they came highly recommended and got a side of their potatoes (so yummy with melted cheese on top). I ordered their Fresh Organic OJ (definitely fresh and sweet) and it was exactly what I needed to start the morning! My friend ordered their Lavender Honey Latte and found it to be alright, but not sweet enough like she typically likes her lattes. Overall, it was a cute stop!\", \"Great food and even better service can be found here. The staff are really likable. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is it took about half an hour to get a coffee refill.\", 'The service at this establishment was noteworthy. The staff was attentive and constantly checked on us, ensuring that we were comfortable and satisfied. The accommodating nature of the service added a positive touch to our visit.Unfortunately, the drinks failed to meet our expectations. I opted for the Rooibos Latte, while my partner chose the Matcha Latte. Regrettably, both beverages tasted overwhelmingly like milk, lacking the distinct flavors of rooibos and matcha that we had anticipated.Moving on to the food, we decided to share the avocado ricotta toast with poached eggs and bacon. The combination of bacon, ricotta cheese, and avocado was undoubtedly appealing, with the flavors blending harmoniously. However, the poached eggs were a letdown. Despite having had poached eggs on multiple occasions and being familiar with their preparation, these eggs were noticeably undercooked. The texture was far from the desired consistency, and it felt like they were served before they had properly set. This inconsistency in the preparation of the eggs greatly affected our overall enjoyment of the dish.', \"The food and drinks were amazing, and I'm excited to come back for lunch (which they serve all day!). The minus-one-star is only because it was one of the most expensive breakfasts I've had in a while (a small avocado toast and latte came out to about $30 each with tip/fees). Then again, I went in expecting it to be a counter-serve experience rather than a sit-down restaurant experience.The staff were super friendly (they took a long time to serve our drinks but apologized for it) and they seem ok with dogs inside!The avocado toast had literally the most perfect avocado slices and olive oil, and the vanilla paste latte was better than Sightglass across the street. The toast is on the small side so it's more of a snack than a full breakfast.\", 'If you are around Lower Haight for brunch, you need to hit this place. We were in town for a quick visit and this place blew us away. We came in for brunch and the staff was polite and accommodating from the second we walked in the door. They seemed happy to be there, which I think is an important aspect of a great meal. The menu was very simple, which I think is helpful. We all had the Breakfast sandwich, in variations (some on baguette, some on croissant, some with bacon, some without). We all loved it in each way we ordered. The presentation matched the taste; amazing. I thought the portion was also very reasonable for the price. I will definately go out of my to go back here next time I am in SF.', \"Best restaurant on divisadero by far until I write my next review! Came here on a break from yoga teacher training where we were learning all about the fear of death and how to overcome it. God, that fear is strong for me. But when I took a bite of the most perfectly seasoned breakfast sandwich on the most incredible French baguette? You know I forgot all about the ticking clock and how it struts and paces ahead of us. The oozing egg, the creamy avocado, the perfect balance of ingredients. It made one of my wrinkles disappear. The Niçoise salad is a standout as well! The salmon tasted unlike any other salmon I've had. It was tender and flavorful and perfectly cooked. I imagined the salmon in its last moments on earth, and how afraid it must have felt, and then I felt a wave of peace as I imagined it would have volunteered itself to the hook if it knew it would be part of this perfect dance of vegetables and dressing.There's an incredible dog here named Twiggy that has the poise beyond anything 100 annoying yoga teacher trainees combined could muster. It seems like he owns the place, and he owns it well. The human owners are also so charming and lovely that I hope they never do succumb to the eternal sleep that we all are destined for. They have too much incredible food and drink to give this world!\", \"I was about to visit this place before 2022 ends but they were closed. So I included this place on my bucket list of the places to visit in the Western Addition. This place is definitely my jam! The staff are very welcoming and friendly. The interiors of the place is very clean and has some indie vibe of the place's setting. Everything is very pleasant.I ordered a tuna sandwich and a mocha. I didn't realize the sandwich comes with some salad on the side. They all seem nutritious. A lady, who I assume to be the owner, kept asking me how was my mocha. I said it was perfectly fine. She seemed delighted from my response.I'd definitely be back. I strongly recommend this place to anyone visiting the NoPa/Western Addition area. I just wish they'd be open more days.\", \"Came by on a Sunday morning around 9:30am and was seated immediately on the patio. We got the breakfast sandwich ($16) +  bacon ($3) and the dual grilled cheese ($16). The grilled cheese was our waitress's favorite and it was mine too! It melts right in your mouth and is just so satisfying. The salad addition was a nice lighter touch, although it had too much herbs for my taste. The breakfast sandwich was good too, but I will say a bit pricy for the size. I would have still been hungry if I had ate just that. The yogurt was a bit too sweet for me, I wish it was greek or something more tart and less sweet.Overall, service was friendly, but I will say a bit pricey for the portion sizes- though I do know food costs are high in general right now. Cute little neighborhood spot though!\", \"I mean all I can say is wow. I looked up this place and was suspicious of the 5 star rating as usually restaurants with a 5 star rating only have 3 phony baloney reviews, but no this is not the case here. That's my jam earns every single star up there. The service. The food. The presentation. The drinks. The background story. Each of these puzzle pieces fall together into the most beautiful painting I've ever seen. Once again, wow. So happy to be a girl in this world on this day!\", 'Went there for the first time this past Sunday. Ordered a quiche and a croissant sandwich. Both are very yummy and not greasy at all. Will definitely revisit the lace and try out other food.', 'Croissant breakfast sandwich- 6/5Avocado toast - 5Avocado Ricotta Toast - 6/5Lavender latte - 5Nut Butter & Jam - 5Great service, awesome ambience', 'Cute place.

Of you are looking for something quick and nice.. definitely this place. I was walking around to see what can I wat and I found them it was so nice.', \"This place is AMAZING!  The owners have poured there energy into an incredible, inviting, elevated cafe. It's my favorite place for a sandy or salad in the city.The food is surprisingly gourmet - I could eat the tarragon, cilantro tomato/cuke salad with every meal. The salad nicoise reminds me of Paris and thr BLT is just straight bomb.The owners built everything in painstaking detail and are super friendly. Also, it's on my top five list of best parklets in the city - check out the detail I this thing. Man I love this place!\", \"I can't say enough great things about this lovely little establishment. I've been for brunch now probably 5 or 6 times with different groups of friends and everyone has enjoyed food, drinks, and ambiance (even our dogs enjoy the ambiance!).Food: let's start with the reason one comes to a restaurant in the first place - the food. I've only been for brunch, but in my times coming, I have yet to meet an item I didn't like. My staples include:- The Breakfast Sandwich (which comes with a cute side parfait) - I get it with both the croissant and the baguette equally often - this sandwich is the perfect balance of toppings - avocado and cheese with perfectly runny egg. This time I got the bacon and it was basically candied - I don't think I'll ever skip that again. Plus, who doesn't love an entree that comes with a perfect portion of dessert. - Grilled Cheese - there is something special about this grilled cheese, it's got a few types cheese and somehow manages to strike the balance of both gooey inside and crispy outside. Plus, it comes with a small dab of mustard, which I didn't think I would like - but it added some nice sharpness to the dish- Heirloom Tomato Stack or Beet Salad - while they weren't on the menu this time, these dishes treat vegetables RIGHT and when I see them I won't hesitate to get them - they are complex without being overdone and make the vegetables the Star Drinks: their painted lattes are certainly a hit - but my favorite thing to get here is the Persian rose tea - which comes with a side of saffron sugar (the loose leaf comes in a French press and you can see the roses floating in the container!). When I first got it - the owners let me do a side by side taste test of their new teas and this was certainly a showstopperWhich brings me to... Ambiance: besides having a homemade parklet (one of the comfiest in the city), the team that runs the restaurant often comes to visit every table and stop to chat - they are an incredibly nice couple who is passionate about the work they do. While the cafe is never so busy you can't get a seat, it has enough people to have buzz. They are still coming up, so it can be a bit slow - but it has gotten much faster in recent weeks (and who really wants to get sped out of brunch anyway?). Next up for me is coming here a weekend afternoon for a glass of wine and snacks!\", 'Spectacular food, beverage and service. Soooo glad we found you! The lattes are so creative and delicious. The food looks like art and tatters amazing.', \"Seemingly a cute cafe with a comfortable outlet also have DELICIOUS food! Chef obviously knows what he's doing and knows how to pick his ingredients! Everything tastes fresh and delicious and the perfect balance of flavors. Don't forget to ask about their specials and dessert!! It's definitely worth the stop for breakfast, brunch, lunch, a snack, or just a drink. And don't get me started on how great and friendly the owners are! Everyone's super nice.\", \"Sweet spot on Divisidero, That's my Jam is it! Gorgeous parklet and indoor restaurant. Great food too! We had the grilled cheese, beet salad and bacon quiche. Delish. The grilled cheese was full of cheese and lovely tomatoes and perfectly grilled bread - it wasn't greasy and cooked to perfection. The quick was fluffy, almost like a soufflé. Well balanced flavors and not too dense. Beet salad was great too. They also have  lattes in many flavors, $5 IPAs and $10 mimosa's made both in our party happy. Looking forward to trying the breakfast sandwich! Sorry I didn't take more food photos. I was too busy eating it!Waitstaff were great!\", 'Overpriced and not that good. The breakfast sandwich is subpar. The avocado toast was mediocre.', \"The food!! The service!! Had an amazing BLT and the jam toast does live up to the name. It's a super cute restaurant perfect for midday\", 'Man o man. SO delicious. My wife and I found this gem on a whim while dog-sitting in town. We had their new salmon mash special and bacon quiche w their house cocktail (cuz I forget the name ha) and a mimosa. Amazing food, great service, and quaint covered patio on bustling Divisadero. Highly recommend!!', 'The food was excellent and I really enjoyed all the attentive staff.  The plate was perfectly portioned so that I did not feel overly full when I left. I will definitely be coming back to support this restaurant that is working hard to bring high quality food made with love (and excellent ingredients) to Divisidero. I liked the purple shirts!', \"Had the BLT here and thought it was pretty good, though I wish it was more tomato-y. I remember reading somewhere that a BLT is best thought of as a tomato sandwich with bacon, not a bacon sandwich with tomato and and that' show i like to make mine. This one was more of a bacon sandwich with tomato. But it was still tasty.\", \"The breakfast sandwich is so good, the donut holes scrumptious. A lovely place complete with a sweet chihuahua. Prettiest ladies room I've seen in a restaurant! Great service.\", \"I was walking my lab down Divis when I spotted the sign for turmeric latte. The staff welcomed me warmly ( I decided to sit in the parklet, you know, dog and all) and I had a delicious lunch of avocado toast and the advertised turmeric latte with an extra espresso shot. Absolutely delicious.  The avocado was sliced thinly--not smashed and spread--and covered with the right amount of olive oil and a dash of vinegar. Yum. I'll be back with friends.\", \"That's My Jam is our favorite local breakfast spot!! Nadia and Mark are so lovely and warm. They put a lot of detail in their dishes and have high quality ingredients. Our favorites include the bacon quiche, avocado toast, the mocha, turmeric latte, crème brûlée. We tried the lobster eggs Benedict today and we're blown away! Truly every dish here is delicious! We're so happy to live close by!\", \"Popped in on a Saturday morning for a quick snack. We were so impressed by the service here, everyone was friendly and super helpful. The restaurant itself was a bright warm purple and had a beautiful ambiance. A perfect place to sit down and do some work as well as it's relatively quiet. I got the rooibos latte with oat milk, it was delicious but could have used a little more forward vanilla flavor. Chose the avocado ricotta toast and my god this was delicious. The bread was soft and the flavor in the avocado was wonderful. As good as it was I did wish the portion size was just a little bigger for the price.\", \"I have been to That's my Jam multiple times and each time it was amazing! The food as well as the service are top notch! They also have a cute self-built parklet outside. Give them a try on the weekend and you won't be disappointed!\", \"Flowery. Colorful. The service, ambiance, and quality with distinctness of food make the difference here. The toasts are excellent, whether with avocado, jam, nut butter, or just cheese. Plating is great, this place stands out in the neighborhood. Love the outdoor parklet seating, they need to install a wind screen since it gets cold. I'd come here again if I'm feeling special... and ready to pay full fare.\", 'Love this place. Best outdoor seating on Divis - gorgeous wooden booths. The lavender latte and breakfast sandwiches are delicious, and the staff are warm and friendly.']\n",

      "Reviews: [\"I love happy hour, and theirs is GREAT! Living in the neighborhood, I'm always on the hunt for good (meaning both price/deal + quality of food/drinks) HH specials, and this fit the bill perfectly. My favorite of their special take on pizza--which I believe is called Pinsa--is like fluffy flatbreads with toppings and a generous, generous pour of olive oil on top. DELICIOUS. You could seriously taste the quality of the ingredients.My partner and I sat at the bar and got to watch the pizza oven magic unfold with our front row seats--highly recommend snagging these seats if you can. The way that the pizza man stretches the dough in the corn meal/flour(?) and then times it perfectly in the oven is fascinating to watch. I think the vibes are really relaxed and casual; waiters are friendly and quick, and I seriously appreciated that they queued when HH would end so that I could put in my last couple orders!\", \"Yummy!!! Wow great bang for your buck and such good pizza! I got the pork cheek, mushroom, and truffle pizza and it was absolutely delicious. Very filling and a good amount of toppings. I tried a bite of the pesto gnocchi as well which was a bit cheesy and oily for my taste but still very good!For appetizers, we got the Brussels sprouts and burrata with prosciutto. Brussels were very good and so was burrata! I do feel like they need more bread with the burrata portion size though.Service was really quick and they had a cute inside to the restaurant! It wasn't too noisy and there was good spacing between the tables. Will definitely be back!\", \"TLDR: Super cute pinsa place on Fillmore. Pinsas are like airy flatbread pizzas. The ones here are incredible -- I'm definitely coming back to try more. Get the Truffle Cheeks Pinsa if you like rich flavors, truffle oil, guanciale, and mushrooms.------FOOD:1. [MUST TRY] Truffle Cheeks Pinsa (5/5): Dough was airy with a nice crispy top and chewy center. Toppings were divine -- SUCH a flavorful experience2. Little Gem Caesar (4/5): Solid caesar! Definitely nothing fancy here, but I will say the house croutons are excellent.  ------AMBIANCE / ENVIRONMENT:* Cute vibes inside, but less cozy and more industrial feeling. Beautiful view onto the street given this is located on a corner. Lots of light coming in* Would be a cute place to have a first date or to catch up with a friend* Wasn't too busy on Sunday night at 6:30 pm so this is likely a place where you could walk in without a reservation if necessary! ------SERVICE:* Had a nice server who patiently gave us some great recs\", 'Came here for a spontaneous Friday date night. Fun ambiance with indoor and outdoor seating. We sat outside - the heaters were great, as it was a bit chilly. Shared a couple pinsas and salad. Both the Margherita and Spicy Calibrian were delicious.', 'Visited here during the Fillmore Jazz Festival weekend. The place was busy but we were able to be seated right away. The service was swift despite the overly crowded atmosphere. Everyone in our party ordered the pizzas. Let me just say they were all amazing! The ingredients to the perfectly cooked crust. Soft and airy on the inside with the right crackle on the outside. I am looking forward to visiting again. We ordered the Sausage Pinsa ($21), Spicy Calabrian Pizza ($22) and the Margherita ($19). Prices is what is to be expected in the city and in my book worth it. All in the party was satisfied and wanting to visit again.', \"I loved my meal at Pinsa Rossa!  My bff and I visited last night and had no problem getting seated around 5pm.  We had their cappaletti spritz, which is super similar to an aperol spritz--perfect for a spring day!.  For food, we started with the hamachi crudo, which was divine with the orange slices.  We also had the burrata and prosciutto crostini--delicious!  I loved the bread they used.For pinsas, we ordered the truffle cheeks and the portofino.  Both were really good.  I loved the truffle oil in the truffle cheeks, and the sweetness from the fig jam in the portofino.  The crust is so light and fluffy yet crisp, I feel like I can eat a whole pinsa myself!  They also have a lot of pinsa options, so there's something for everyone.Carlos was our server and he was super friendly and accommodating.  Can't wait to come back and try more of their food!\", 'The bar was set high for Pinsa Rossa. A fancy little place with promises of great Roman style pizza. I don\\'t want to sound like a snob but I have had pizza in Rome and I cannot call this an accurate representation of Roman Pizza. This is a like if a Neapolitan style pizza had an identity crisis and was trying to convert to a Romanism style. It\\'s somewhat close but you\\'re always going to be who you really are. I know some of the menu is this \"pinsa\" style and the rest is supposed to be Roman style? While I noticed a slight difference between the two, it wasn\\'t significant. I don\\'t mean anything I\\'m saying here negatively, just observation. Because at the end of the day this was a very solid meal. The carbonara pinsa was basically breakfast pizza (which is awesome). The buffalo margherita was very satisfactory. The prosciutto & stracciatela was the star. We\\'re talking a little sweet and a little savory and I\\'m a little happy about that one. We got stuffed squash blossoms too. I mean it was a fried vegetable with cheese. I\\'m not going to dislike that. All in all I was quite pleased. Is my mind still in tact? Yes. I wasn\\'t blown away. But was it still really solid, also yes. No complaints. (4.2 Stars)', \"Pinsa Rossa seemed like a new addition to Pacific Heights and while strolling around on a Sunday evening, we decided to give it a shot! Let me tell you, I'm so happy we did :-) First, if you're like me and don't know the difference: Pinsa is a dough that is pressed by hand, expect something lighter and in this case tastier than your regular pizza.  We got the Heavenly Mushrooms and the Eggplant Parmigiana, both were quite good and enough for 3 people (while leaving room for a little dessert!). We got the Tiramisu, which was amazing! I don't remember the wine we got, but do remember it being good. If you're looking for a new pizza place to try, definitely give this a shot. It might not have the fame of some of the more well-known spots in North Beach, but it is the best pizza I've had in SF so far!\", \"Loved our meal here! My bff brought me here and it was perfect. From the food, drinks, dessert, you really can't go wrong!My favorite was the portofino but the truffle was also very delicious!Thank you Carlos for such a great experience! Already looking forward to my next visit!\", 'Convenient location in Fillmore next to shopping and other restaurants. Made a last. Minute reservation Sunday dinner and restaurant was not too busy. Waiter was extremely great and very attentive. Caesar salad was a bit too much dressing for my liking. Both pizzas we got were pretty good definitely larger than I expected. We ordered one salad and two pizzas among three people and it was more than enough. The carbonara pizza was a bit heavy but bread itself was lighter than standard pizza.', 'It\\'s a pizza shop that reminds me of the one I went to in the Marina last December because I got the calzone and it was pretty big. I ate half and saved the rest. The calzone had maybe ham cheese and was fluffy and light. I don\\'t eat pizza...I eat calzones. Newer restaurant with nice service and not very big from inside. Try the \"pinsas.\"', \"This is our all time favorite restaurant these days. We come here so often and feel like we know the team/staff well:) they are all so sweet and so attentive. Best of all, the food is amazing. I usually don't eat the crust of pizzas but here, I eat everything because the dough is so fluffy and delicious. Even the next day if you reheat the pizza, it tastes like it came straight out of the oven! Every pizza is delicious but our favorites are the carbonara pizza and the spicy Calabrian pizza. Their Caesar salad was really flavorful too. The indoor decor is lovely. Feel like the perfect combo of fancy and chill, romantic and fun, or even if you just want a bite and glass of wine by yourself this spot is great - the bar area is so fun. Overall my favorite spot lately, must go. Once you go though, you'll be returning multiple times:)\", \"Hadn't gone to the previous pizza place in this spot as ai heard mixed reviews, but when this one opened it looked really cute so was really excited to try it! We walked in on a friday night a little before 6:30pm and was seated at the bar. Food came super quick! We ordered the pork & beef meatballs ($13), truffle cheeks pizza ($21) and the beef & arugula salad ($14). The meatballs were ok, a little too salty in my opinion, but liked that it came with some bread! The arugula salad was beautifully plated and and lots of beets! l I liked that they were sliced thinly rather than in chunks. The pizza was the highlight! The crust was light and airy, yet slightly chewy- it was so so good. The truffle wasn't overpowering and not too salty from the pork, and perfect amount of cheese. Would get this again! Overall, quick service and tasty pizza. One of the better restaurants on fillmore in my opinion!\", \"Great food, really put off by the hostess awkwardly telling us that we had a 60-min time limit on our table.I want to be extra clear, the food was great! I got the Carbonara pizza and the Prosciutto pizza to split with my friend. We loved them both - they really hit the right balance of a both crispy and chewy crust. So so goodWhat really put off both my friend and I was immediately after we were seated at our table (6pm reservation, sat around 605pm because we were 2mins late) another woman/hostess (not the same person that sat us) came by and whispered to us that they had another party coming right at 7 so we only had a 60-min time limit for our table. And when I say whispered, I mean whispered - I had to ask the woman to speak up because I couldn't hear what she was saying at first. It was really uncomfortable. I'm all for transparency on table time limits, but this was not clear when I made the reservation. I also think 60-mins for a sit down dinner reservation is a bit quick. Because it was such an awkward interaction with this woman, we ordered immediately when our waiter came back. We didn't receive our food until sometime around 6:35/6:40, so we felt really uncomfortable about making sure we were done with dinner, paid and out by 7pm.I would highly recommend being a bit more transparent about your time limits, but I'd also recommend increasing table time limits to at least 75mins so people don't have to feel rushed.\", 'pizza was great, and the place had a very cute charming vibe! decent amount of vegetarian options, and one vegan option', 'This was a decent find on Fillmore. The portions are a bit small so I recommend ordering two flatbreads.No matter how small the portions are, the gnocchi is pretty good!! Solid 6/10 The pesto potato flatbread was just okay. Maybe a 5/10 for flavor but 10/10 for the bread itself. So fluffy and delicious!! I would try another in the future!!The interior is very warm and nice and the service is good.', \"Not too cheesy, unique delicious toppings, crisp fluffy crust. The taste profile of the pinsa here is very similar to that of wood oven pizza, so it did not have as much of the wow factor, but it definitely did taste lighter than your typical pizza. -Positano (4.5/5): I was eyeing this one from the get go, and it was delicious! The ingredients were so simple yet complemented one another so well -- light touches of ricotta with mortadella and pistachio for a nice crunch.-Portofino (3.5/5): This one was also really good -- loved the fig jam for a touch of sweetness. But I did feel like I was really just eating cheese and fig jam. The prosciutto shriveled up and there were barely any pieces. The cheese also got cold really quick and I think this one is best enjoyed warm. The sweet salty flavor was really nice though.Overall, it's a great spot to go with a friend! I love that you're able to cut up the pinsa yourself. The main thing I wish is that there was some means of keeping the pinsa warm and heated throughout the dinner.\", 'Disappointing first visit today.  I think that the staff was overwhelmed with their short-handed situation.  May give them another try.  Much more impressed with the nearby Pizzeria Delfina.', \"This was a cute restaurant with great ambiance on a very lively street in SF. They were quite busy when we arrived at 6:40pm ish. They have both indoor and outdoor seating with heater. However, the service tends to be a bit slow maybe because they're understaffed.CLASSIC CAPRESE: i was a little disappointed with this because I was expecting sweet cherry tomatoes but they were normal tart cherry tomatoes. The cheese was creamy and the seasoning was nice. But I think the whole dish would've been even better with sweet tomatoes. HEARTY TRUFFLE PIZZA: I really like their pizza dough! I'm not a huge fan of truffle flavor because it could be overpowering and too much after eating it for a while, but luckily I didn't feel like the truffle oil was too strong on the pizza. The pizza was nice and well balanced with the creamy white sauce and cheese, chewy and crispy dough, slightly salty meat, and truffle oil. PROSCIUTTO & STRACCIATELLA: I thought I would really like this pizza but turns out I'm not a huge fan of it. I feel like all the ingredients didn't harmoniously well in my mouth for some reason. I think I'm not a big fan or buratta on pizza because it's like melty and doesn't act like a glue with the other ingredients on the pizza.\", \"RIP Dino's (then Dino & Santino's, then Santino's). I have lived in the neighborhood for over 25 years, My first apartment in the city was catty corner and I could always see into the windows and watch Dino schmooze with the locals.Times, they are a changing. I didn't really have faith in Dino's last iteration of a pizza and wine bar, and I think COVID really hurt the business (But I do think it was Dino's decision, not forced upon him to sell.) There are a few Dino's employees still working there (which is lovely).We ordered to split: -the broccolini (which was really really good, they should offer it on a pizza, it had lemon and warm cheese and some croutons, just  crave-worthy.)-  the mushoom pizza (the Forester I think it is called) and we added house-made sausage - which was an ideal add-on)- The crust was perfect Pinsa, crispy, airy and a bit of char.  We were ready to go and they brought us out a dessert (the dough fried with a pit of nutella) - We were already full, but powered through the four pieces.  use lovely of them to offer it up. Happy to support this new business.\", \"There's a new pizza restaurant in Pac Heights.Actually not pizza. It's PINSA.  Two different things.Opening up where long time Dino's once was is Pinsa Roma, on the corner of California and Fillmore.  There's a pretty long list of 16 pinsas to choose from.  I enjoyed the Carbonara.  If you like Carbonara too, try this.  The guanciale (pork cheeks) was a nice flavorful topping.  I'd comeback to try other pinsas with guanciale, and there are quite a few.The pinsa crust here isn't quite as airy and puffy as other pinsas I've had locally.  But it was soft with a nice slightly crisp bottom. Just know that if you've had pinsa in Italy, there's no comparison. Not sure if the difference comes from the ingredients, oven or technique.  I like the upbeat vibes with music. I'm sure it'll be a popular neighborhood spot.  It was 100% packed.  No pastas. Focus is on the pinsas.\", \"Came for walk-in dinner on a Monday night and was seated immediately. We ordered some drinks first, which came out pretty quickly.My friend and I ordered a bruschetta and the carbonara pizza. The tomatoes on the bruschetta were really fresh and yummy - I wished they had added a bit more of the balsamic vinegar drizzle, but overall a great appetizer. The carbonara pinsa was really decadent and filling. Overall, the food and service was great - our waitstaff was very attentive throughout our meal. Will definitely come back when I'm in the Fillmore!\", 'I cant say enough good things about this place.The food is outstanding. We tried a few different pinsas and all were exceptional. The pinsa is light airy crisp and chewy. There are also a bunch of non pinsa offerings that we tried including the meatballs(wow!) And burrata(melt in your and pleasing to the taste buds).The service is also top notch which is quite refreshing. Oh nice wine list too!Cant wait to return soon!', \"Loved this place! The ambiance is just the right balance of classy and casual. We came in with a reservation on a Sunday night and split the Truffle Cheeks pinsa between the two of us. The dough was airy yet still chewy, and the truffle flavor was pleasant and not overwhelming (and I say that as a mushroom hater.) For two people, one pinsa is enough if you're not too hungry, but two might be too much even if you're both hungry. Wish the table we were at was a bit farther away from the table next us and not smack dab in the middle of the busy restaurant. Definitely a nice addition to Fillmore street with yummy special pizzas!\", 'Made reservations for a Friday evening double date. Shared 3 pizzas between the four of us and it was the perfect amount. We tried the Margherita, Spicy Salami, and Truffle Cheeks. All were delicious, but my fave was probably the Margherita. Service was quick and friendly. We were seated on the balcony/second floor which was nice for privacy. Would come back!', 'Went here with a few friends and had no issue getting a reservation for six on a Friday evening!The pinsas were light and delicious reminded us of the pinsas at montesacro! The service was also nice! Think this was overall a very solid meal! Would not go out of my way for this place but would return if I was in the area!', 'Enjoyable thin pizzas that are light and airy. The pizzas are made on a light bread and topped with red or white sauces.Ambiance is nice.Would come back to try more pizzas', \"The best pizza in the city that I tried. Thin, crispy dough made in front of you garnished with fresh ingredients just in the right proportion. Also, it's a decent size pizza. This is going to be my weekly spot for a comforting delicious meal.\", \"These guys are amazing! Great food, great people, great service. You can't go wrong with their pinsas.\", 'Wow, I don\\'t write reviews often, but Pinsa Rossa was amazing. Great location, friendly staff, and cute vibe. I\\'ve definitely have had my share of pizzas, but I\\'ve never had a \"Pinsa.\" The pinsa dough is really unique, a puffed, crispy, yet chewy dough, but I can\\'t quite describe it. They also give you your own pizza cutter, which I thought was a fun touch!We tried multiple Pinsa, they were all good, and I don\\'t know which one is my favorite. For more unique flavors the carbonara and portofino (fig and prosciutto) were amazing, but they have a pepperoni and sausage if you like a classic taste  Another note: we had leftovers and popped them in the toaster oven, wasn\\'t expecting them to be as good the next day, but the crust was just as fluffy and crispy.Definitely will be back again to try more item, until then, thank you!', 'Absolutely incredible! This place has really exceeded my expectations, and we have visited a few times already. The pinsa is amazing, so delicious! The service is friendly and attentive. I only wish they would expand their cocktail menu, because it is pretty limited, but overall, Pinsa Rossa is really wonderful and I look forward to future visits!', \"I happened to pop in for their soft-opening last night;. A friend and I had a meatball appetizer that was yummy with a couple beers to start. Nice interesting variety of Pinsa options, many of which I've never seen. We shared one with an Italian ham, olives, artichokes, peas, and sliced eggs; I've never had eggs on my Pinsa/pizza before but it was a really good combination. The soy/rice crust was really light and airy, I ate half the Pinsa and did not feel bloated as with other crusts...was really light and tasty!We also had the Carpaccio plate also served with arugula and various healthy and tasty toppings. Lastly we had some red wine with our meal, my buddy are both wine drinkers and I looked at each other as we discovered another great wine! It was a UNTI Syrah blend which we're going to find and buy some bottles of.The staff were friendly and attentive, and Ken the owner was very friendly and there to please.Overall great food, nice atmosphere, and an attentive friendly staff. Score!\", \"Yesterday evening I had a dinner here with a group of friends. I discovered this new restaurant one week ago just walking in my neighborhood. You can reserve a table through Resy. Pinsa is the main dish as the name suggests, and they offer several types of it. I chose the Margherita but with stracciatella instead of the normal mozzarella. I liked my Pinsa, it was perfectly cooked (crunchy around, but also soft at the same time). Also my friends enjoyed their Pinsa (my husband complaint was only the poor quantity of Prosciutto). The price is the same of the other pinseria (I think it's pretty high compared to a normal pizza). The restaurant is nice even though i didn't like the position of our table because it was close to the entrance. Overall, it's a good addition to the neighborhood.\", \"Food was amazing! Me and my date came during happy hour, the vibes were amazing and the service 10/10. There wasn't anything we didn't need for because the staff was quite helpful. Will definitely be coming back!!\", \"Had the truffle cheek pizza and arugula + pear salad. Delicious! The owner was very friendly. Clean and simple interior. Great stop when you're in San Fransisco!\", 'The service was exceptional & the food was divine . We loved the pinsa dough used for the pizza. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends. And we will definitely be back.', \"4.5 starsGreat option if you're looking for last minute reservations. That's how I came across this spot, but I actually ended up being super impressed with the food.We started with the broccolini and the meatballs. Both were good but not the star of the show. The star of the show are the pinsas. This is the kind of pizza I love - fresh toppings + airy dough without the greasiness of most pizzas so you don't feel terrible after eating it. I got the prosciutto & straciatella pinsa which was tasty, although I did find myself wishing I had gotten the mushroom or carbonara pinsa since those seemed more flavorful / savory. I love prosciutto pizzas and while this one was no different, I will say it wasn't quite as cohesive as the best prosciutto pizzas I've had, and it was a bit hard to eat since the toppings kept falling off.The only other pinsa shop I've tried in the city is Montesacro, and I actually enjoyed my pinsa here more (although part of that may just be because I liked my toppings better here - my boyfriend prefers Montesacro).\", \"great pizza! the dough was light and airy which I loved more than traditional crusts. our party of 3 shared the the caesar salad (7/10 some pieces had too much sauce while others lacked sauce), proscuitto pizza (8.5/10 ample amount of toppings), and carbonara pizza (6/10 too much cheese for me). we were afraid we didn't order enough but the pizza was super filling and we still had leftovers. the service was amazing and the ambiance was very nice. definitely would return to try their other pizzas!\", 'Great place on Fillmore. Split the ceasar and the recommended prosciutto and stracciatella and had the Cappelletti spritz cocktails. The salad was good and the pizza was great. The bread was light and airy and the toppings were excellent. Everything including the drinks reminded me of Europe and service was great/so nice. 5/5 recommend.', \"I had been meaning to try this place since moving into the neighborhood recently and walking by several times. I had never heard of Roman Pinsa before, but a lighter, healthier pizza dough sounded great to me. I am not sure what I was expecting, but in all honesty, this place Blew My Mind!The dough is crispy, airy, fluffy, light, glistening with olive oil, and absolutely exquisite. I ordered the Heavenly Mushroom and it more than lived up to its name. My fingers felt the sheen of the olive oil but nothing was greasy in any way.This was one of the best doughy, cheesy, saucy delights I have ever eaten.  And I truly felt light and healthy afterwards.  None of the heavy belly or heartburn at all I sometimes get from eating pizza. Unbeknownst to me, I happened to be sitting next to the owner at the bar who inquired about my experience.  He was so friendly and gregarious and really appreciated my feedback.I will definitely be back soon and often.  I am not sure why I'd go anywhere else in the neighborhood for pizza and I would make this a destination if I didn't live nearby. Do yourself a favor and get yourself some Pinsa Rossa ASAP.  You won't be sorry, but you may become addicted.\"]\n",
