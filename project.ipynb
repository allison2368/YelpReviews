      "Reviews: ['Went to Bottega for a date night and let me tell you it was amazing. Had a reservation so did not have to wait long, once seated the waiter attended to us right away and we were able to order. Food is amazing and so fresh! Drinks were good too. Highly recommend for a cute little date night.', \"Everything was great! Food, menu options, staff & vibe. It's nice to have a traditional Italian restaurant that isn't stuffy or way over priced\", 'We had an amazing experience at Bottega! The food was delicious and the service was exceptional! We tried several dishes and none of them disappointed! I would highly recommend and I will definitely be returning!', \"Bottega surprisingly had dishes that seemed unique to other italian restaurants I've been to. The interior was pretty dark and they actually have these table lamps that they turn on for you, with just a bit of ambiance on the ceilings and walls. I got a seat with my two friends in the back corner so I didn't have too much incentive to look around. It was the day before Thanksgiving so maybe we got really lucky with the timing and managed to get a seat. By the time we were done, the restaurant was about to fill up.Their complimentary bread is very good. If I go to a restaurant and I enjoy their bread, it speaks volumes from my perspective. They have dried tomato in some of the pieces which adds a light kick. Olive oil on the side if thats your thing.I got the salmon fettuccine and it was pleasantly soft to bite into the salmon. Most of the time I get a salmon dish at italian restaurant, I often get displeased that the fish has been cooked too long. Then again, not my recipe. They add this sauce which they refer to as 'pink' and I'd say it makes the whole dish creamier. Not too bland, and not too overpowering. Really enjoyed it. I didn't try the other dishes but I didn't even recognize that my friend got ravioli so A+ for how their dishes stand out! The two tables next to me had my head turned every so often to look at the dish they ordered.I'd say if you are in the area and are craving some italian food, definitely try this spot out! I'd come again on a date for sure. The service here is excellent as well since they often come to check up on you.\", 'Came here on a Friday night with 2 friends. We were able to be seated pretty quickly since we joined the Yelp waitlist ahead of time. As the night went on, there were definitely more and more people waiting to eat (we sat down around 7:30). I think everything that we had ordered was good! The pasta was al dente, the sauce was hearty and the pizza was crispy. However, there wasn\\'t anything that stood out to me to be like \"Yes, I want to come back!\" Partially, I think it had to be the service. They kept rushing us and asking to take our plates away even though we hadn\\'t finished yet. It was so odd! I\\'m sure it\\'s because they wanted to hurry us up but also felt a bit rude. Like it makes sense if our plates were empty but we were clearly still eating.We sat outside because there were no more seats indoors, and it felt really nice. There were heaters to keep you warm. One surprise was that it was someone\\'s birthday, and they had someone come out and play the birthday song with a trumpet which was so cute!', \"This place is a solid 4.5 with a perfect experience and good food! They don't take reservations, so it's usually just a wait, but luckily on a Sunday night, there was no wait. Sara was our waitress and was very nice, and she knew all about the food, joked around, and gave us good recommendations. The atmosphere is darker and intimate, but also very lively despite not having a wait, so it was definitely a place that people seem to enjoy! I have been here before, but did enjoy it the first time so wanted to try it out again (looks like I forgot to review this place the first time!)They gave complimentary bread as starters, and you could easily get lost finishing it while waiting for your food. Not sure how fresh the bread actually is, but it was buttered and warm. We ordered the Sacchetti and the Quattro Formaggi Roman pizza, and I was so surprised that this place actually split the pasta into two dishes for you to share! The Sacchetti is unlike anything I have tried before, and would say it is one of the dishes to try here to see what it's like. They are like tortellini/ravioli filled with cheese with hints of sweetness like pear, and then with some walnuts to add a sense of earthiness and crunch. It fills your mouth with all textures and flavors, and really does feel like a balanced pasta dish even though the ingredients are so simple! The Roman pizza was also very nice, a great amount of cheese but still with distinct flavors from the different cheeses they use. For dessert, we got the Tiramisu which I thought the cream was great, but just felt on the dryer side as it felt like the lady fingers could have been soaked more like you would have for a classic tiramisu. Last time I came here, I remember getting a pink sauce pasta, but that was on the tangy side and not something that I really remember, so I need to try it again next time I come to give a proper review of it. But the portion sizes were good and the service was great!Overall I think this is a solid modern Italian place in SF! I think the food and atmosphere is great to continue to visit again and again, and I don't think I'll find a dish like the Sacchetti anywhere else!\", 'First night in the bay and pasta sounded like a great idea. This place was so lively and fun and turned our ordinary Thursday into Thirsty Thursday. We ordered various pasta dishes and appetizers and they were all a bit smaller in size than we would have preferred, but still delicious nonetheness. Our waiters were so lovely, accomodating, a genuine joy to be around. I would definitely come back and recommend this spot for a lively atmophere.', \"This is truly a beautiful restaurant with gorgeous pink hues and floral accents.The complimentary bread, a rare treat nowadays, was quite good. Our waiter made ordering our meals such a breeze by offering  insightful recommendations. I opted for the Mezzemaniche Boscaiola with pink sauce, it was so delicious! The staff's thoughtful gesture of singing Happy Birthday for my friend's birthday and presenting a complimentary panna cotta added a thoughtful and sweet touch to the overall experience.\", 'I highly recommend a daytime visit to Bottega to immerse yourself in its enchanting interior, featuring captivating pink hues, wood finishes, rose gold accents, cascading flowers, and exposed brick--a perfect backdrop for dressing up and capturing beautiful moments.The food was yummy, and my friends enjoyed their meals too. I ordered garlic bread which was perfectly seasoned -- not too much, or too little. I also enjoyed my gnocchi with pesto sauce.  The pesto sauce was made into a perfectly creamy blend and not oily/greasy. Gnocchi can oftentimes be a rich and heavy dish, but they somehow made it light. The service was kind, and attentive. My water glass was always full. We were regularly offered refills of complimentary bread, and this bread was so soft, warm, and flavorful. It was a highlight on its own for me. Additionally, the wait staff surprised me with a happy birthday song, and panna cotta with a candle. Sooo thoughtful, and brought a smile to my face. Thank you!', \"I mean... come on, if you walk pass this place, you are instantly sucked in by the open concept giving you a full view of their bar and alcohol selection with the aromas of delicious food being cooked and served. Bottega has always been recommended by my coworkers so I had an opportunity to take the family a few weeks back. Nicky, our server, was so welcoming by treating us like we were regulars. She made recommendations, told us the special of the day, and also took note of our daughter's food allergies. Kids were being basic yet again, ordering a pasta with butter and another one with meatballs. My wife and I shared calamari fritti, lasagna and they were kind enough to split the branzino for us. Food was fantastic with the branzino being the highlight of our dining experience. Fish was cooked to perfection, capers and potatoes were a nice touch, and everything was seasoned perfectly! I would come back just for this!Cocktails were tasty and beautiful... solid wine selection as well! Thank you Nicky for making us feel so welcomed!\", 'No Fees', \"Ordered to go on Yelp so unsure of ambiance. Delivered fast. I did the build your own pasta. I did the rigatoni with garlic, chicken, and pink pasta. The pasta was Al dente for sure. Barely taste the garlic: chicken was dry. Pink pasta sauce taste store bought like or like frozen food. The second one was the Ravioli, garlic, mushroom, onion, Italian sausage, and bolognese sauce. Ravioli is good. Didn't see any onions and i paid extra, barely 4 slices piece of mushroom and paid $2 extra, no garlic flavor,  but there was a lot of Italian sausage pieces. Sausage is bland. The sauce basically taste like spaghetti O ravioli sauce the one you can buy at Walmart. Most likely would never order from here again. Doesn't taste fresh, authentic, or has much flavor. Didn't come with utensils, so make sure to ask for it.\", \"This is my favorite place to get pasta in the city or to order on DoorDash! It's so aesthetic, perfect for dinner out with the girlies or date night. Depending on when you come, there may or may not be a wait. There is an option to add yourself onto the Yelp waitlist remotely which is convenient. We always get wine to pair with our dinner. My two go-to pastas are the:*amatriciana: the spicy tomato sauce with the guanciale is so good; the perfect combination of spiciness with warm pasta*mezzemaniche boscaiola with pink sauce: the pink sauce is so creamy and flavorfulParking wise, it can be a little difficult to find street parking. There's also metered parking all around. It's overall a cute spot in the mission to try out!\", 'good simple Italian fare with solid pastas and pizzas. no gimmicks needed, just the type of place you and a few friends would enjoy sunday dinner together family style.  Amatriciana was the standout here, no pancetta substitute here, guanciale all the way!Food: 8/10Value: 8/10Service: 7/10Vibe: 8/10', 'So yummy! Service was very considerate, and they brought out this huge black pepper grinder, which was fun. Cute date spot, though there were also families and friend groups there!', \"Delicious Italian off mission street! Their whole menu looked yummy so it was tough choosing. Went with the lasagna and wasn't disappointed. The first bite was so cheesy and scrumptious and brought a smile to my face. They also give you complimentary bread which was an awesome great. Love this place!\", \"Came out for a much-needed date night and Bottega was the perfect spot to go to. First off, the decor is amazing. Florals everywhere and a cute neon pink sign, it meets the needs for both girl brunch and romantic date night. We chose a seat by the open window so we could enjoy the warm weather and people-watch during our meal. For the food, we started off with the burrata alla caprese which is essentially just a caprese salad but with burrata instead of mozzarella cheese. Very creamy and refreshing, a nice way to start off the meal. They also bring out complimentary house focaccia throughout the meal which is buttery, soft, and savory. For my main, I decided to get the gnocchi with the bolognese sauce while my husband opted for the sacchetti. My meal was definitely the heavier and filling of the two - they don't skimp on the portion of pasta and the meat sauce is rich on its own. While my husband's meal portion is probably not enough to fill up someone who is pretty hungry, the dish itself was fantastic. I'm normally not a fan of blue cheese, but the combo of blue cheese, pears, and walnuts was spot on. The dish comes in a white cream sauce which pairs very well with the other flavors on the plate. A must-try. Even when I'm full after my meal, I'm a sucker for whatever dessert item looks unique. Here, it was the limoncello mascarpone cake. I was a little worried it would be too much on the lemony side, but the lemon flavor was actually just the right amount. Mixed in with the fluffy cake and the creamy mascarpone, this was the absolute perfect, refreshing yet satisfying dessert to end our meal. Bottega is a must-try! Looking forward to our next visit.\", \"The ambience here is so great for a date night or a night out with friends. I ordered the truffle ravioli with burrata salad. Let me just say the truffle ravioli had me coming back for more the following weekend. It's now one of my go to pastas. Also, need to mention that they serve complimentary homemade focaccia?! im obsessed. A must try if you're in SF!\", \"I came here for dinner with a party of four around 7:30pm on a weekday and were able to get seated really quickly! I loved the decoration inside but it did feel noisy and was hard to hear my friends talk sometimes. We ordered an appetizer, two pastas, and a pizza to share which ended up being the perfect amount for all of us. Both pastas (mezzemaniche boscaiola and gnocchi) were good except the texture of the noodle was too firm for my preference. The flavors overall were great though! The bruschetta and margherita pizza were also fine but didn't really stand out to me compared to the pastas.\", \"Their Friday and Saturday night hours extend to midnight now! Super lively energy even late at night (it's hard to find food spots open after 10pm in SF). Good vibes for parklet seating and indoor tables too Ordered the prosciutto burrata pizza in person for takeout, and it was really easy and only took 10 minutes for them to make! Came with red pepper and Parmesan on side.Pizza is a nice focaccia texture, more of a hefty bready bite flatbread but still soft/chewy. Burrata was so creamy. I thought there could have been more flavor outside of a saltiness, like a fruit, pesto, or pepper accompany the toppings.Would likely come back to try their pasta next time and get cocktails if with friends.\", \"I remember ordering Bottega during the pandemic and I wasn't happy about it. I didn't rate it at the time because I don't think it's fair to rate any spot solely for take out so I decided to stop in today while I was in the Mission. At first sight, I was very impressed with the decor. There were flowers everywhere and it seemed like we were transported to a garden in Europe. The ambiance was 5/5. The food however was lackluster. The focaccia bread tasted stale. You could tell the pasta was made in house, but still something was missing. The size and shape are atypical of what you would normally expect for pasta especially the spaghetti noodles. I was excepting a chow mein type noodle but was given a fettuccine type--this is just my personal preference but it threw off my experience. The rigatoni in the arrabbiata sauce was my favorite.\", 'No Fees']\n",

      "Reviews: [\"My bestfriend and I went to this restaurant before a show and it was such a great choice! Our server Christine truly went above and beyond, making sure we ordered things we'd like and even remembered when we told her we had to leave at a certain time to catch our show. Wish we could've talked to the owners to let them know how amazing she was! She and the other staff made the experience so much more memorable. For apps we ordered beef and cheese empanadas and arugula salad. For mains we ordered the beet rigatoni and mushroom burger. We also ordered 3 diff cocktails, all very well made, but the 10/10 fave was the black noir. My friend who doesn't like sweet drinks was so in love w the black noir cocktail, so highly rec. Overall food was super good, but my fave dish was the beef empanadas!!The atmosphere of the restaurant was aesthetically pleasing and cute. I hope they end up getting full bar service, so FYI they only have soju based cocktails, and wine I believe. Which was great, but I do like more typical cocktails as well.\", \"Lovely staff and service and the drinks were amazing but the food was just okay. I really want them to be successful but the flavors need some punch.The rigatoni was wild but pretty good. Steak was good not great. The chicken was pretty good. Beef tacos were our favorite app. Dessert we didn't order but the offerings seemed odd too.\", \"We went here last night since we live a few blocks away.  Service was 5 stars, never had to ask for anything but some of the menu items need to be reworked - our food was mediocre at best and a bit overpriced for what we got.  Thai Curry Chicken was definitely missing something (it was very bland).  Noticed someone else gave the same review but wasn't even acknowledged by the Manager.  Wasn't a fan of the chickpea puree since it just made the already bland curry sauce even more bland.  Could have used more vegetables and flavor in the curry sauce as well.  Salmon was served with a block of beans which seemed like a strange choice instead of some seasonal vegetables or something with more flavor and color.  It was a brownish piece of salmon with brown pile of refried beans....Not sure we would go back here again.\", \"Memento was a great spot to meet a friend for drinks and dinner. It has a cozy chic vibe, shareable plates, and amazing cocktails. The mussels are the best I've ever had with a decadent, creamy sauce made of Thai coconut milk, white wine, lime and curry. The Salmon Tartare was great with the avocado on the bottom and ponzo aioli plus the side of crispy, fried empanada chips. We also really liked the Crispy Skin Salmon which had great flavor and went so well with the side of fava bean purée. The coconut fudge pie was fine but a little chewy for me. I personally loved the cocktail menu as there were so many inventive, soju-based drinks. We ordered two of the sweeter, fruitier ones, the Berry Me and the Holiday on the Moon (topped with a cookie!) They were also low-ABV though they tasted so good that I definitely drank more than usual.\", 'Cool new spot in Noe for an upscale dining experience.  Service was spectacular right from the time we got there and loved that they welcome everyone with a complimentary shot (tasty and not too strong).  For appetizers we ordered the flatbread, salmon tartare, beef and cheese empanadas, and zucchini fries (special for that day).  The salmon tartare was my favorite as it had a generous portions of salmon and avocado.  The flat bread kind of reminded me of a soggy microwave pizza and was my least favorite.   For mains we had the beet rigatoni and the curry chicken.  I appreciated the originality and presentation of the rigatoni, but it was somewhat light in flavor.  The curry chicken also felt like it was missing something. For desert we had the lime mouse and the flan.  Both were excellent and were devoured in minutes. Overall, they have good food and even better service.  We enjoyed our meal and would consider coming back.', 'Great food, engaging service, super cool ambiance. The owner was working behind the bar and provided fascinating conversation all night while serving up delicious food and wine with a Brazilian panache.', \"Good food, great drinks and very friendly staff. The kitchen was fairly slow but it was opening night so I would give them a pass while they sort things out Hello Brent, Thank you for dining with us on our opening night :)We appreciate your feedback and apologize that our kitchen was running a bit behind on our first night of business due to staff shortage. Since then, We've hired additional staff and feel that the food flow improved. We appreciate your support and hope we can turn this review into 5 stars during your next visit. Cheers!\", \"Came with some friends on a Thursday night. We made a reservation ahead of time, which I would recommend because it's a small space. We were greeted with a shot of a specialty drink of theirs, which was very nice. We ordered a variety of appetizers- loved the Shishito peppers and the zucchini fries (off the menu). I ordered the salmon as my main and my boyfriend got the rigatoni. The salmon was solid, but if I could order only one thing again, I'd get the beet rigatoni- it was the perfect combination of flavors!\", 'Such a lovely new addition to the neighborhood. We were seated at the bar and had a great time conversing with the owners and other patrons. Raf is an artist behind the bar and takes great care in his preparations, while Suhair is the life of the place! We had the Zucchini sticks and Salmon tartare for appetizers, the Crispy chicken was a main course followed by the Flan. Everything was delicious but the standouts for us were the Salmon tartare and the Flan. The drinks were also very well made and we will back here soon!', \"This is IT! The perfect neighborhood eatery. The food is delicious. Approachable but elevated. And you MUST save room for dessert...We were lucky enough to be invited to the soft opening. Now I can't wait to be here every Friday after work for snacks and cocktails!\", \"Was looking for somewhere new to try with my partner and I stumbled upon this gem!Service was warm and friendly, ambience was very sleek, and overall we were more than satisfied with all the dishes we got.Even though I loved everything we ate, I'll forsure be thinking about the filet mignon and coconut fudge cake long after this meal! We most certainly will be back and are so excited to try the other dishes this restaurant has to offer! Definitely a restaurant worth checking out!\", \"We were lucky enough to experience Memento SF opening week and it was very special. They have a great location with easy parking (which is not easy in the city).  I'll start off with the list of creative and delicious cocktails that they have are top notch, it was so difficult to decide which one to try first, my personal favorit Black Noir,  a smoky and unique drink , I wanted more. I had the Salmon Tartare and the Crispy curry chicken AMAZING and I was able to try more that were delicious. Overall it was an amazing experience, great restaurant , ambiance and service. Date night or dinner with friends this place is great.\", 'My partner and I happened upon this restaurant by chance and I am so glad we did! Walking in we immediately remarked on the aesthetic and how it was our kind of spot. We had cocktails and a small bite at the bar, and both left a big impression! Every member of staff that we interacted with were so attentive and kind, and made us feel as if we were old friends. Absolutely looking forward to our next visit!', \"It's all about the details...We really enjoyed our first dining experience at Momento SF. The service from the second we approached the door to the moment we walked out was impeccable.  It really felt like fine dining service within a neighborhood spot. The comfy space felt both fresh and intimate.  I'm a fan of a smaller unique menu filled with thoughtful dishes over a fluffed menu that tries to please the masses.  The amuse-bouche-like beverage arriving shortly after sitting down was great to sip while perusing the menu. The food was beautifully presented and delicious. Momento SF is a  much needed addition to the Noe Valley neighborhood.  We look forward to supporting this new business in the very near future.\", \"Dinner @memento.sf was fantastic. The menu is eclectic which means something for everyone. For a small-ish space, the ambiance is lovely. The waitstaff is kind and attentive. Great service. I'm excited to return. 1. You Had Me at Hello #cocktail2. Za'atar flatbread which has a perfect flavor3. Salmon #tartare was plate licking my good.4. Heirloom tomato and arugula salad with a generous portion of avocado 5. Shared Lime Mousse dessert with a raspberry compote that was light and refreshing.\", 'Delicious! The food has a unique flavor that all blends together beautifully. The presentation is spectacular. The cocktails are super different and comes with a fun twist with the garnishing and design. A lot of fun, you want to try all of them. The decor is stunning and I like the soft lighting. The beef tacos to start and the rigatoni was yummy and I am excited to try more. A nice place for a date, a celebration or just because. So glad this special restaurant is in the neighborhood.', 'Great food and ambiance. The staff is very attentive. The mignon was perfectly cooked and tasted amazing!', \"This was such a treat! I came here to celebrate my partner's birthday. Memento is somewhere where you can talk, eat, and enjoy the good ambiance. I was so immersed in conversation and the food that I didn't get a chance to snap a picture of the food or bar! :)The service was impeccable: they are extremely friendly and attentive here. I ordered the Portobello Mushroom Burger and it came with Truffle fries. The brioche bun was so tasty. And the fries were thin cut, delicious, and topped with a sprinkle of cheese. Would order again, because the burger was good but the fries blew my mind. What a great addition to Noe Valley.\", 'Awesome cocktails. Highly recommended. Ok I have to write something else because of the stupid yelp rule.', \"A small but inviting space to enjoy fine dining, great service and personal attention from the owner. Happy Noe Valley has another good restaurant. Only complaint: no decaf coffee but they'll have it soon\"]\n",

      "Reviews: ['This place has very good alfredo here and the customers they gave me was awesome, I will def give them a try if your out in the bay area. My wife thought I was exaggerating until I had to ring her ha', \"Came here on a Saturday night without a reservation. We waited for 40 minutes before we were seated. I'm normally not a huge fan of Italian but this is one of my favorite Italian spots in the bay.Not so - it was refreshing and the grapefruit really toned down the sweetness.Dungeness Crab Arancini - crispy on the outside. I loved how it was topped with pickled pepper radish and coated with scallion aioli. It was so good.Handkerchief - I'm always a fan of Bolognese so when I saw this white Bolognese, I knew I had to order it. It was so creamy but still felt light because the pasta was paper thin. I also loved how the pasta came out piping hot.Bucatini - the pistachio pesto got me to order this. The tomato based sauce was so light and tangy. The cheese on top added a little bit of creaminess. The pistachio pesto worked surprisingly well with the tomato sauce.\", \"Leaving a four star review because I think Yelpbiased higher scores but let's be clear this place was average, especially for food.Just being upfront the food was overpriced and over salted. It's not that it was bad per se, but not worth what Pearl is charging. Nothing was bad but nothing was memorable at all.If you're coming here, stick around for the service and pleasant atmosphere. Those were highlights.\", 'Want to have a great meal in a lovely place?  Try Pearl.   Being a single patron, I sat at the bar although I was given a choice to sit outside.  Both options seemed quite good.  And the staff was tip-top.Roasted cauliflower with sliced almonds, raisins and a black tahini hummus sauce was a great way to begin my meal.  The plate was well composed and the spicing was nuanced and subtle.Next up, seared scallops with spaetzle, corn and braised onions was a wonderful main course.  The crisp exterior of each large scallop encased an interior that was not overcooked.  And the sweet corn enlivened the entire plate.In and out and home to walk the dog while it was light.   And parking on Sunday evening was easy.', \"Pearl is my favorite restaurant in SF!I've tried a decent amount of their menu and everything is delicious! Starter, mains, dessert, drinks, everything!!! I try to stop by every few months to try their seasonal dishes.I had a work dinner here a few months back and my out of town colleagues all loved their meal here! Interior is very cute and service has always been great. They don't take reservations over 6 people so probably not the best for large groups, unless you're ok with splitting up the group into smaller tables.I love their cauliflower! I order it every time. For mains, all of their pastas are fantastic and I've loved every scallop seasonal dish I've had. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. My favorite cocktail is the tidy tips. Can't wait until my next visit!\", \"One of my favorite restaurants in the city! I love that it's hidden in the Richmond. I've come twice now and both times, the food was amazing and service was exceptional.I love trying their pastas, but everything is delicious. You can't go wrong with any of it.\", \"This is only my second time here, but it's become one of my favorite restaurants. I don't eat too much salad, but Pearl's Caesar is the exception. Their Caesar has a strong taste of anchovies, creating the perfect umami. If you're not a fan of anchovies, this salad may not sit will with you lol. It's lemony, cheesy, and the crispy prosciutto and croutons elevate the salad really well. I could eat this by myself if I tried, but of course I shared it with my boyfriend lol.Their steak tartare is the standard for me - whenever I order it elsewhere, it never compare to Pearl's. Beefy, lemony, and full of flavor. The texture pairs very well with the crisps they provide.The bavette steak was really good according to my boyfriend. He barely shared any with me and devoured it lol. I would love to order this next time if its on the menu.A few gripes..The Gemelli - first bite was delicious, full of flavor. I loved the spice and combination of the capers and sun dried tomatoes. The tuna was cooked well. The thing is - the more I ate, I soon came to realize how salty the dish was. I love salt and all things savory, but it became difficult to eat. I love olives, but their olives made the pasta even saltier considering the capers and spice. They really need to lighten their hand when seasoning this dish lol. I would have returned the dish had I not waited so long for it. This brings me to my next point..The wait - It was busy. I will not deny that. We were lucky enough to snag a reservation. Our Rez was at 730, and we came right on time and was seated immediately. We ordered maybe within the next 5 minutes. Our apps came out pretty fast, and I'd say we were done eating them by 810? The thing is, our entrees didn't come out until 840. Every single table around us had gotten their food before us, despite having came after us. The table to our left only ordered entrees - ok, that I understand. But the table seated directly behind us came a good 20 minutes after us, and also ordered apps, yet their entrees were also delivered before ours. The table to our right had completely finished eating before we even got our entrees. It was disappointing, as the service was subpar. I understand it's busy, but the waitress (Katie I believe) didn't pay us any mind and we had to flag her down to receive updates regarding our order. I'm willing to wait, so long as it doesn't feel like our order was forgotten lol. It felt like that. The waitress didn't seemed concerned that we were waiting that long. I honestly think she forgot to put our entrees in? Either that, or they need to work on their timing with the delivery of apps and entrees. I will surely be returning and will be supporting this business, but would recommended avoiding the dinner rush as much as possible. I'm sure it's much better when they open right at 5. Overall, this restaurant deserves their flowers despite the underwhelming service.\", \"Ambiance: I booked an inside table for 8pm on a Sunday. It was charming and lively. Very nice for a date night. Service: Attentive and nice!Oysters: 4/5Solid - texture was smooth and the toppings complimented the oyster. Acme bread and butter: 4/5Solid, but nothing special - what I'd expect from complimentary bread and butter from the table, except this time it was a $4 chargeChicory Caesar: 5/5Amazing! I love the texture and taste of the crispy prosciutto with crisp mixed lettuce. The croutons were also great. Everything worked well together. Handkerchief: 4/5Solid pasta, and best pasta of the night. I haven't had a white bolognese before. It was light and easy to eat. If I were to make this at home, I would add maybe a touch of truffle oil to add more to the dish. Bucatini: 4/5Loved the stracciatellla with the pesto and basil. I thought the dish was okay at first, but it grew on me with each bite that I took. Buttermilk Panna Cotta: 5/5Silky panna cotta, absolutely lovely with the strawberries and the chocolate sable. Olive Oil Cake: 5/5This was my favorite out of the two desserts I tried. The texture of the cake was everything and more. The ice cream worked well with the cake too. If you were to choose between the cake and the panna cotta, choose the cake!Overall, solid food.

The cocktail list is inventive and the bar tenders execute them well.\", \"I took my husband to Pearl for his dinner and we had a wonderful time. The atmosphere was very welcoming, it was cozy, and we felt like we could relax. Our waitress was nice and gave us helpful recommendations. We ended up having the Kanpachi Crudo, the Hankerchief Pasta, and the Seared Scallops. All were very tasty and I would have again. My only slight disappointment was that I put that it was his birthday on the reservation, when I was texting to confirm the reservation, and the waitress when we sat down. Despite all of this, they didn't bring a candle with the chocolate cake we ordered. I know this is small, but it's a nice thing that restaurants do and it doesn't cost much - I was a little sad that it made it slightly less birthday festive.\", \"First time back in over 4 years. Was surprised that the menu hasn't changed too much. Overall, still a solid meal especially the tartare and pastas.Halibut crudo: Fish was refreshing, but thought the peanuts and jalapeño overpowered some of the more subtle flavors.Chicory Caesar: enjoyed the garlic croutons and certainly a more hearty salad.Roasted cauliflower: Really enjoyed the charred smoky flavors and the black tahini hummus.Steak tartare: one of my favorite dishes of the night. Super savory without feeling too heavy.Mt. Lassen Trout: Fish had nice flavors, but was a bit over cooked IMO.Handkerchief: One of their signature dishes. Pasta had a great al dente texture. Would order again.Gemelli: Nice bounce to the pasta and enjoyed the freshness of the peas.Cocktails: Prices were pretty good for SF standards ($14)Birds Eye: Essentially an old fashioned. Wasn't necessarily too creativeCoastal scrub: Refreshing and citrus profile.\", \"One of my favorite Mediterranean/Italian spots in SF, with consistently great service delicious plates, and creative cocktails.

They can easily accommodate gluten free and it was just such an incredible meal. The staff is so friendly, the cocktails are absolutely phenomenal, and the actual restaurant space is just so beautiful and inviting. Definitely make a reservation, or plan on waiting for awhile, as it's a fairly small space and definitely popular.\", 'My rating is a solid 4.5/5. The service was impeccable. I came with two toddlers and was seated immediately on a Friday afternoon. Our waitress was named Alice and she had great communication, was kind to my girls, and offered to get their food in first which helped immensely! I order the scallops and Brussel sprouts . The Brussel sprouts came out first and highly recommend! However the scallops took a very long time to come out and seared nicely however some were not cooked properly. And for that minus .5 stars. I will definitely be returning to try their cocktails, dessert and more menu items.', \"Pearl 6101 sits on a quiet street, but the restaurant and bar are bustling and busy.

The steak dish had so many flavors - good combination. It could have been a little more tender on the outside but overall very good medium rare. The pasta was good as well (!), just not as unique. Finished off with panna cotta which was super light and tasty! Only thing is that it is quite echo-y inside so it's hard to hear what each other are saying.

Although the restaurant is smaller, they do have a long table that can accommodate larger group. I definitely recommending ordering a variety of plates because they are shareable. Most known for their House Butchered Meats, the prime rib was juicy and perfectly cooked (coming from someone who does not normally go for the red meat). The servers were attentive, friendly, and stayed ready to refill your drink!', \"Hubby took us here right celebrate our 31st Wedding Anniversary and we of always invite our son everywhere we go as he is a product of Love! Let's start with the med height guy with a curled mustache I think who greeted us, he was meh not too attentive but okay, sat us down in the corner booth table because I asked for that, sure wished he told me of another booth table in the back with more space as we are very tall people, nonetheless we were snug & comfy which was all that mattered! Then a young blond guy with a half ponytail bartender I believe came and took our drink order! My son mentions happily to him ... it's my parents 31st anniversary... and this guy just had this blank stare as if he were saying in his head ... AND? ... gave him our drink order and another guy took our appetizer order maybe the guy who sat us down? Can't remember! Throughout the night a very tall handsome server who we saw treat every guest with a huge smile and laughter and silently I wished he was our Server! Entree time we sort of got my wish cause he came and asked if we were ready to order and the one that sat us down pushed through and said not so nicely ... I GOT IT ... and we watched the Happy one walk away still smiling! He later came and asked if I wanted anything else and I asked for more wine and could not help but squeeze in there how I loved how he treated his guests and his smile! Didn't get his name but I do remember his face and will definitely ask to sit in his area!  That was that! We loved the ambiance and if all the servers were like the tall guy, well you'll be seeing us more!Now the food ... absolutely delicious! The calamari was the only meh dish we had, kinda rubbery but had a delicious taste. Sorry won't be ordering that again! I love me some crunch and some tentacles in my calamari ha ha!Those other two servers would smile and be like the tall server this night would've been even more amazing! From the ambience to the food to the wine everything was just wonderful even with those two hiccups! So Blind Butcher we will be back but we will ask to sit in the happy tall guys area!\", \"I wanted to give this place 3.5 stars. The ambiance is great, it was pretty packed on a Thursday night and in a great location in Castro. The service was a little slow (probably bc they were busy) and forgot our drinks until after the food came. The food was ok, I was excited for the Wagyu burger ($27) but it was a lot smaller than I expected, and the meat was SO dry I couldn't even finish it. I wish they put other toppings inside it like lettuce, pickles, or anything to give some juiciness. The fries that came with it were delicious though! My partner got a chicken dish that was tastier and more worth the price. The mashed potatoes it came with were really great! If I come back here, I would definitely try the Mac and cheese after all the positive reviews about it!\", \"While we were eating at Blind Butcher, a guy casually walks by nekkid...full frontal and everything...and hardly anyone bats an eye.Except the tourist couple whose jaws were sweeping the floor.That's what I love about The Castro...if you got the balls to, anything goes!Been eyeing The Blind Butcher since they opened in 2019 (sister resto to Dunya and Lark). And, my curiosity further grew with their hype on socials. When Plan A fell through, Blind Butcher it is because last minute rezzies were very easy to get. But, rezzies weren't needed since it was pretty empty on a Thursday. So, if you're looking for last minute place for a weeknight dinner, Blind Butcher may be a good option.Blind Butcher is open for takeout and dine-in. No delivery.

However, it was small and expensive compared to the bougie burgers at Nopa, Spruce, and Miller & Luxe that have a thicccer patty and same price point. I know wagyu is in its name but it's a buzzword that's loosely thrown around these days.Instead of the truffle fries, we received regular fries dusted with old bay (?).

However, for being a marinated prime cut, it was quite chewy. I know it's shrinkflation times but Lolinda has a similar 18 oz ribeye for $52. The accompanying chimichurri was hella salty so I appreciated that it was on the side. The ribeye includes several pieces of roasted potatoes, shishito peppers, and a tomato. Had we known this, we wouldn't have ordered another side of mashed potatoes.S E R V I C E Our server was nice and upbeat. Maybe it was an off day but service was too lax and lacked attention to detail. After we finished our meal, we had to go inside twice to ask for the bill...in a near empty restaurant (only one other table occupied).Food service was fast; apps arrived within minutes of ordering.A M B I A N C ECozy and sultry date night vibes with red banquettes and nice bar area. There's four patio tables in front.P A R K I N GChallenging street parking so give yourself an extra 15-20 minutes. No nearby garages.Overall, I have mixed feelings about Blind Butcher. While they nailed the meat temps, I didn't think the food and service was commensurate to a $100 pp dining experience. IMHO, there's plenty of other places in the city you can better spend that monies. Glad I tried it once tho.\", \"This place is so so yummy! My boyfriend found it on tik tok and we gave it a shot during one of our weekend stays in SF. We had the ribeye board and it came with shishito peppers, tomato, potatoes and a side of chimichurri. The ribeye was SO good and the bucatini we had was delicious too. Definitely a higher price point restaurant but everything was delicious even our cocktails. I wouldn't think twice about coming again!\", \"Absolutely amazing food, service and ambience! It's in a busy area in the Castro so plenty of do after dinner!We loved that they were able to accommodate our big group and sat us pretty quickly. Our waiter, Curtis, was amazing and extremely attentive the entire evening. Even reading the note on open table that it was our friends birthday and brought him out birthday desserts. The food tastes just as good as it looks! Id recommend sharing the ribeye and ordering some sides. It's good enough to feed 3. It's a big boy! Our friends ordered the rosemary chicken and not pictured is the Wagyu burger which my friend said he could lick and eat the whole plate! Will be coming back soon!\", 'Came in on a wednesday night to celebrate a birthday. We had reservations so we were seated right away. There are a good amount of tables along the wall in a pretty intimate space. We noticed it was quite busy even for a wednesday. We ordered calamari, potatoes, prime rib eye, and pork chop. We loved it all. The rib eye was cooked perfectly medium and came with little potatoes and peppers on the side. The pork chop was moist and had lots of carrots and potatoes in the sauce. The calamari was thick and tasted really well with the sauce. The potatoes were a great side and perfectly cooked. We did family style and between the 3 of us, there were still some leftovers. We ordered the opera cake and tiramisu for dessert. The cakes were moist and rich and a perfect way to end our dinner. Overall i was really impressed with the food and cant wait to come back again.', 'DON\\'T LET THE NAME FOOL YOU - Great place even for vegetarians / pescatarians!!! Their Hip wood-based decor with ambient lighting makes for a cozy date night spot.Started off with some fresh fries lightly tossed in spices. Crisp outside, mushy inside (perfect)! They served some chardonnay to go with the appetizer. The main course was a family style butcher board (which my friends verified was delicious) and the lobster mac & cheese. Generous portions of lobster in the dish, with a perfect crisp cheese layer up top and gooey bits inside. The mac and cheese was served in a cast iron pan which kept it warm throughout our meal. Macaroni was al dente, and the bite on the pasta mixed so well with the mushy cheese! Service was excellent and they accommodated my vegetarian dietary preferences by serving me a Moussaka from their neighbor restaurant \"Lark\". It was mildly spiced and had lots of fresh veggies. Finally, the merlot that was served with the main course was rich with some fruity notes. Great for sipping though a conversation. Must visit the Blind Butcher!', 'I was really impressed with the branzino and the Elderberry cocktail, but less so with the practically raw shishito peppers. The service was scatterbrained and we were often left waiting long periods of time to place orders. Our two hour meal could have expediently been half that with more attentive service. The dining area was nevertheless nicely decorated and dark enough and loud enough to impart some privacy, though not so much of either to be miserable. Overall, standard overpriced meal in San Francisco.', \"Before I dive into my review, I want to mention that for me personally, food alone is 3/5, but I gave an extra star because of the ambiance.Let's talk about the food first. My friend and I ordered these dishes -1. Butcher's wagyu sliders (small bites)2. Crispy calamari3. Rack of lamb4. TiramisuWagyu sliders were definitely bigger than what I had in mind. The meat was very juicy, and the buns were soft. That, combined with the aioli sauce, made the sliders delicious. Crispy calamari wasn't much crispy and was okay. The rack of lamb was also okay. The meat was very tender and well cooked but lacked flavors. It came with horseradish sauce, but it was too strong. Tiramisu was delicious. It was very light and just the right amount of sweetness.This place is a great date night spot because of the ambiance. It's very modern, cozy, warm, and welcoming. The walls are covered with photos and paintings of old artists and San Francisco city from back in the days. There was jazz music playing in the background, and I liked it, though I wish it wasn't as loud. Our server was really nice and was on top of taking care of us.\", \"Years ago, I raved about this place and awaited the day I would come back. Unfortunately, the dishes weren't as incredible as I remembered. Besides the brussel sprouts, which were seriously the best appetizer I've had recently! Each piece was a crispy, sweet and salty morsel that would change anyone's mind about this vegetable. The Grilled Prosciutto Burrata appetizer was a favorite as well. Other than that, the wagyu burger which my group and I all ordered was pretty average. I guess in my head I hyped it up so as I ate it, it felt quite dry and underwhelming. I ordered mine cooked medium too so not sure how it didn't hold its moisture. The ciabatta was dry and complicated the burger experience too. Another dish that fell short was the truffle lobster mac and cheese. As much as I wanted to believe there was lobster in this, I feel like it was crawfish... the flavor, the size, all just insinuated crawfish in the soupy cheese sauce. It had somewhat of a fishy/seafood flavor to the dish and no noticeable truffle taste. Although the entrees underperformed, the service absolutely did not. We didn't have a reservation and they were booked for dinner, but the host made it work with some open outdoor space. He constantly made sure we were comfortable and got our food out quickly. The chef also stopped by our table throughout the meal. He was bouncing between their neighboring sister restaurants and thanked us for visiting them. I would come back for the apps, drinks, and hospitality!\", \"The moment I had got there it was a great ambiance. It was a busy night and I thought I had out my reservation in but it was on the wrong day! They were very able to accommodate me anyway! Plus one star! Staff and service was very nice. Overall: 1 star added for the service alone which was very friendly, but as a food critic and something of a culinary artist myself I cannot bring myself to give this place more than one star for the food.The nitty gritty:I ordered the prime ribeye medium rare and came out super rare. The cook must have not let it sit the appropriate amount of time before cutting and serving.The octopus was undercooked as well, leaving a gummy undercooked seafood texture we all know as sashimi shrimp.However the sauce and herbs surrounding the dish was superb and I ate each bite with it.The back of the octopus was cooked perfectly so they must not have used something to hold it down as it grilled.We ordered the calamari which was greasy and the breading was soggy :(.The waygu burger was alright but still undercooked to how we had requested.Truffle fries were really good.I was really amped to go here and try it out due to the hype on social media and I feel they may be overwhelmed by all the new attention it has been receiving.The taste was all there but the preparation needs work. For the price it cost to eat here I may not be coming back.It was a nice effort though. They were pretty crowded.Edit: I actually decided to downgrade my star review because the dishes were unique and good quality. But I shouldn't be paying over 180$ for a meal that is brought out raw. I know what kind of neighborhood it is but not everyone likes it raw. Also if there is something wrong with every single dish we ordered, quality control must be instilled. Idk if he was on vacation or what but this was completely unacceptable.\", 'Cozy/moody ambiance, wonderful service, and delicious, flavorful food. We especially loved the roast chicken with veggies and potatoes, short ribs and potatoes, and the overall variety of dishes they offer. There is something for everyone, and the dishes are shareable. Drinks and dishes are on the pricier end however the quality is good. Hope to visit again soon.', 'Welcomed and enjoyed our evening assisted by Manny. We ordered the Brussels sprouts- very tasty! Also the burrata ravioli and the short rib- plentiful portions and good flavor. Frankly the ravioli tasted more like ricotta than burrata but the freshness of the homemade pasta and the delicious sauce were fantastic. Short rib was fall off the bone and the amount of the meat was commensurate with the price. Lovely meal. We chose toeat  outdoors which was great but inside looked so cozy and hip!', \"Everything was cooked to perfection and seasoned well. I thoroughly enjoyed the steak, and absolutely loved the octopus appetizer. The service was really quick, we didn't wait long for any of our dishes, including water refills & check. Would highly recommend!\", \"Came to Blind Butcher to Celebrate my daughter's birthday and the host and everyone around was so nice and welcoming. Love the atmosphere and the food was 10/10 We all enjoyed our dinner party and will definitely be back.\", 'Celebrating an early bday for bff-fam at Blind Butcher. Ever since they posted their iconic celebratory reel on the gram, we needed to check out all the fanfare it generated. Vibes are completely chill w/ eclectic art, plush red booth seats, and dim lighting...giving jazz club vibes for cool cats. Menu is simple there are apps, protein options and whole braised branzino to feed a small family of 9...so we got two of those because why not. lol Please do not sleep on the apps: Crispy Calamari, Grilled Octopus, Shishito, Truffle French Fries... and the table ordered to share Braised Short Ribs, Lamb Chops, Ribeye Steak, & Prawns. The kid ordered their lobster truffle mac. Dylan helping our table was amazing...beautiful, attentive, and super accommodating and friendly. Made the dinner so comfortable and our groupreally enjoyed. Go here and order everything. Street parking and a lot off Castro St. entrance, we got lucky and found one right in front. Planning to revisit in the near future! Thank you/Mahalo Blind Butcher!', \"Came here for an early Father's Day celebration.  We ordered a few dishes and decided to do it family style.  Everything was delicious and came out relatively quick.  Definitely worth a revisit. My only critique is that there were 5 of us and two small round tables were put together to accommodate us.  Sitting wise we had plenty of space but once the food came it was a game of shuffle to make space.\", 'I\\'ve been wanting to try this restaurant for months. I finally got the opportunity when I had a friend visiting me for the weekend. I wanted to love this restraint so much but unfortunately our dining experience was just okay. First, our waiter changed twice so we\\'re confused on who was going to be taking care of us. We ordered some sparkling rose and champagne but when the server delivered the drinks they were confused as to which drink was which.  They even had to go back and check to make sure. To their defense the restaurant is very dim. The food was fine but nothing exceptional. We started with the burrata (w/ prosciutto) and Brussel sprouts. We shared the ravioli, spaghetti and meatballs, fillet mignon, and salad. All dishes were ok. The fillet was very rare and when we checked with the server they said that is considered \"medium\" to them. We didn\\'t want to be those people, so we just ate what we wanted and left a good portion of the steak on the plate.Probably won\\'t be returning anytime soon.']\n",

The crew sang happy birthday for me and provided a yummy dessert. The food was amazing! I had the grilled salmon. They also have a huge selection of wine. Alina and Berry served us and they were wonderful. The ambiance is very nice and classy. It's perfect for a birthday dinner where you can dress up and take pictures after.\", \"It was such a great experience! Seems like they just opened a few weeks ago, and we would highly recommend! Everything from decor to food to service to location and the restrooms were on point. We sat outside, and it was the most beautiful sunny day to dine outdoors. Esvet was so awesome! We got the beef meatballs, linguini, beet salad and key lime pie. I hear the pie is a 20yr old recipe, and it definitely didn't disappoint. Soooo yum! Coming back for the bread pudding next.\", \"Wonderful restaurant and experience in the Marina.  Ambience is great (although it is a bit noisy - just FYI).  Very pretty restaurant with comfortable chairs and great location!Service was impeccable!  Everyone was extremely nice, servers were attentive and the timing was perfect.Food was very good.  We started with the prawn appetizer, I had the salmon and Mr. had the linguini.  Judging by the way he scarfed that down, I would say it was a winner!  Salmon was good along the yummy vegetables served with it.  The prices are not bad either.  Most entrees are in the 20-30.00 range.  The starters and salads are less than 20.00.  Next time I would love to try their beet salad and skirt steak so we'll be back!\", \"We happened to be walking by looking for a lunch spot this Sunday and noticed this new beauty! They opened two weeks ok just off Chestnut street on Steiner. The gorgeous interior decor and furniture  caught my eye. We essentially ordered the entire starter menu minus the prawns . The most delicious item was (allegedly) a butternut squash gnocchi, but tasted more like a delicious Alfredo to me! Pasta was cooked perfectly. Wish I didn't have to share it ;pThe boys really enjoyed the steak tartare despite and exorbitant amount of cheese on it. The calamari was sadly inedible- super dry and cheery. Berry our awesome server kindly removed it from our bill on her own. Burrata heirloom salad was good! Just feel like plating should be reconsidered. Each tomato slice was pretty huge and somewhat awakes to cut. Meatball was a hit as well, delicious sauce. They serve wine and beer as well and I could not stop loving the flower ceiling we had outside. For just their second week up and running, they nailed it. Will definitely return!\", \"The restaurant has a very nice interior. The service really shines here. Our waitress Berry was super nice, attentive, and made good suggestions. The appetizer Gnocchi has a cream sauce that's really tasty. The Steak tartare was ok. I'd prefer more seasoning though. The Filet Mignon was very good. My second favorite was the seafood pasta. The Salmon and Chicken breast was also pretty good.\", \"Ambiance is super cute, great for lunch and/or date nights. The staff is very accommodating and attentive, they will keep your glass filled and your stomach full. Food is delicious, I had the penne chicken (not pictured because I got hungry), everyone enjoyed the roasted chicken, salmon, and the steak. Everything's was cooked to perfection, you can tell that this business truly cares and they check on you to make sure that you're well taken care of. I'll definitely be back with friends, family, dates. Thank you for hosting our party and making it a great experience for us!\", \"We had a great time at Bagatella for dinner. The restaurant is beautiful inside, and our server was friendly and attentive. To start, they provide complimentary house-made bread with truffle butter. We ordered the steak tartare, broccolini, pan seared chicken breast, and seafood linguini. Everything was delicious, but the standout was the steak tartare, which was some of the best we've had in the city. We will definitely be back for that dish alone. They also provided a key lime pie on the house for dessert, which was such a nice touch and a very delicious end to the meal. This definitely a great date night spot, and somewhere I'd take friends for a more intimate dinner.\", 'No Fees', \"Title: A Culinary Gem in SF Marina - Bagatella Shines Bright!Review:From the moment I stepped into Bagatella, the new culinary sensation in SF Marina, I knew it was going to be an extraordinary experience.

See attached photos, beautiful presentation, plating, choice of table wear and ambiance. I can definitely see this as a cute date night location. They just opened and it's a overall very nicely done\", \"Walked by this place and noticed it was new. Had all the classics you can expect at a good restaurant. Stopped by and ordered half the menu. Some of the standouts were:Stuffed butternut squash Gnocchi - top 3 gnocchis in my life, number 1 being a castle in Italy but Bagatella's gnocchi was up there with the best. Calamari -  fried with onion rings was delicious especially with the aioli Burrata and heirloom tomato it's seasonal fruit - chefs kiss on this dish, literally so amazing, fresh, and lightPeach wine cocktail - super dangerous how easy this went down.Bread pudding - perfect for the second stomach after you say you are full.To top it off, Dave provided amazing service, ensuring food came out hot, drinks full, and that we well taken care of. He went above and beyond.Overall 5/5 would come back and eat the other half of the menu with friends!\", 'The ambiance was cozy and inviting, and the staff was attentive and friendly. The menu offered a variety of delicious options, and the food was beautifully presented and tasted amazing. I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a memorable dining experience.', \"out with the old in with the new. bagatella sports a vast menu with many options to choose from. if you're into an American, french, or italian taste this will be right up your alley. the city needs this new life that an establishment like bagatella brings to the neighborhood with the thoughtful decor and modern finishes, on top of a great dining experience.\", 'Bagatella is a new restaurant in the Marina that is a must try! The ambiance is superb, with indoor and outdoor seating. The food was amazing and the service was fantastic. We got the Steak Tartare and Burrata as an appetizer along with Skirt Steak as an entree. Special thanks to Dave & Abe for their amazing service. The evening was everything we hoped it would be. I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely be coming back.', 'This new spot on Steiner has only been open for a month and I was very impressed by the service, ambiance, and the food. The appetizers were better than the mains (imo) but everything was great. The standout was the steak tartare for me. They also play great music and the staff are friendly. Would definitely come back for dinner and drinks.', \"Was startled to see that a beautiful new restaurant had opened in the old Saiwalks (and Askew way back when) spot on Steiner, so decided to check it out.  Had no idea we'd be one of the first customers during their soft opening!This place is going to stick. Great design, crowd pleasing menu and fantastic food.The interior is modern, trendy and gorgeous.  Hard to believe that it has been a fast casual restaurant for the past few decades.  LOVED the dishes/glasses/flatwear.  Nice parklet.  Everyone who worked there was incredibly gracious and excited to see us.Menu has some nice bistro breadth and offers something different than most other places in the Marina.  A few salads, a few pastas, a few meat dishes...something for everyone!  Since it's brand new, here's the rundown:Bread with truffle butter:  A++.  We had a long argument about getting a second serving or not and finally caved.  Really delicious!Butternut Squash Soup:  Outstanding.  I don't usually like butternut squash, but loved this soup.Tomatoes and Burrata:  Tasty and beautifully presented, could have been just a little larger.Goat Cheese Pasta (forget the name):  Beautiful stuffed pastas (sort of tortellini like) with a little honey mustard on the inside that set it apart from anything you've had before.  The chef and server both told us this is their pick for the top dish.Skirt steak with truffle mashed potatoes:  Yum!  Fantastic pan sauce that I wanted to mop up with the extra bread (though found the will power to restrain myself).Spaghetti and meatballs:  Really delicious meatballs and a hearty portion.Tiramisu:  Very good, you won't be sad.Only constructive feedback is that the wine list could use a bit of elevation.  It's pedestrian (lots of names you'll find at Safeway) with a hearty, though not outrageous markup.  No cocktails; didn't read the beer offerings.  They'll get this figured out and this place is going to rock.  $150 for three of us...not crazy.Check it out soon.  It's definitely going to be a neighborhood winner!\", 'No Fees']\n",

      "Reviews: ['good food buenisima comida ya he ido varias veces se los recomiendo demasiado vayan y visitelos', \"Little Shucker is the shuckin' best! My husband and I came here for date night and we loved our experience.  The highlight for me was the oysters, raw and baked!  You could tell that the oysters were super fresh.  We had kumamotos, miyagis, and mere point oysters for our raw oysters, I believe. For the baked oysters, we tried the garlic butter (YUM), and the miso bone marrow (my personal fave!).  The spritz cocktails are really good too.  We tried the pink spritz and the lavender yuzu spritz (super refreshing).  I also liked that they had a natural wine on the menu. :)Little Shucker is perfect for date night or girls' night out!  The vibes and interior are super cute too.  Can't wait to come back.\", \"I've been on an oyster kick these days and Little Shucker was such a fantastic place to dabble. It's not cheap and you can quickly rack up a bill here, but it is surely worth the price you pay. Everything is so fresh and tasty. My friend and I came for lunch with a reservation but it wasn't too crowded. We got six Oysters, the Halibut Crudo, Smoked Salmon Tartine, and the Roasted Nori Cauliflower. The oysters were incredibly refreshing, and we love that we got to sample all three. I also loved the small plates we ordered. The cauliflower was so umami and had a nice bite to it, while the tartine was so hearty and creamy. Service was decent. Nothing to write home about but the atmosphere does make it worth the visit, as it's bright but homey.\", \"All the rave reviews are true - this place is a keeper! Perfect location and immaculate vibes, we loved everything about little shucker. We walked in at opening on a Saturday without a reservation and were seated immediately. The waitstaff was completely attentive and took our drink orders right away. One of our guests ordered a wine on tap, and within minutes was informed that they had to switch out the keg. She had to wait about ten minutes for her glass, and when it was brought to her, we were told it was on the house for her patience. She was offered alternatives but really wanted that wine, so despite her choosing to wait they still comped the glass - completely unnecessary but entirely grateful, we were won over immediately. Then the oysters came. In a city brimming with seafood options, this was the freshest of the fresh. We inhaled our dozen (with a variety from Tomales Bag and the east coast) just in time for the mussels to hit the table. When I tell you we were lapping up the garlic marinade, we were fighting over the last spoonful. For a seafood focused restaurant, their fries were also memorable, and the house hot sauce is  chef's kiss. Incredible experience all the way around - can't wait to come back to little shucker!\", \"Fresh seafood, cute interiors, $2 oyster happy hour, and good wine...how could you not have a good time at Little Shucker. This buzzy Pac Heights seafood spot from the team behind The Snug excels when it comes to simple, good seafood. I sampled a majority of the menu, and my favorite item was the Big Shucker, a classic chilled seafood tower that allows the quality to shine. If you love oyster shooters, you have to try their two creative takes - a sake tomato dashi with uni and a play on michelada with kimchi and pilsner. In addition to the tasty raw oyster selection, I also enjoyed the warm bone marrow baked oyster.For more substantial bites, I recommend the smoked salmon tartine with bright dill cream cheese on a fluffy pan de mie. The hot lobster roll was fine, but not as memorable. I would skip adding caviar to the roll, as it got lost with the strong flavors.My friend and I were comfortably full from the seafood feast, but we couldn't resist trying the pretty greek yogurt tart with seasonal stone fruit - a sweet, but restrained ending to a solid meal.I like that the smaller space, friendly staff, and menu lends itself to many occasions, whether it's a casual lunch, early happy hour, or romantic dinner date.\", 'Came here for dinner on a weekend.Food: 4Decor: 4Service: 46 oysters, 22miyagi, kumamoto, and mere point~4/5. Fresh and cleaned properly.hot lobster roll, 35~4/5. Fresh lobster in a nice, hot, toasted bun. Pretty good, although I think New England Lobster Co. in Burlingame is slightly better.Service was nice and friendly.', \"The cutest spot on Fillmore! Perfect for a sunny day in SF. We ordered the Rockefeller oysters, miso bone marrow oysters, garlic butter oysters and I would recommend them all. We added caviar to the oysters and it was We also got the lobster roll which came with a generous amount of seafood, and the branzino. I would say I've had better branzino elsewhere and would stick to appetizers and drinks here! Great place for friends\", \"Ambiance- decor was really nice and clean, bathrooms were well maintained and the table tops were tidyService- a little awkward and choppy but nice people, but incredibly slow for certain food items Food- some things were delicious and other things needed more attention*Big shucker- presentation was pretty, I think that the oysters were shucked fine, a little shelly but no real complaints. We sat at the bar so we watched them prepare the tower in front of us. The shrimp was really dry and didn't taste fresh at all, however the mussels were our favorite part! The Maine lobster was fine,nothing extraordinary and the geoduck was also okay. *lobster roll- I can't believe they charge 2$ for the chips when the roll is already 35$ I think that's absurd. It was also a small portion and lacked a sauce (butter isn't a sauce) **smoked trout salad- it reminded me of a deconstructed lox bagel in a good way. I wish the portion size was larger or if the plate had more lettuce ** we received our big shucker first at 2:15 and quickly finished the tower in about 10-15 mins because there wasn't a whole lot to it and we were super hungry. But we weren't served our salad and roll until 2:45 which we thought was a super long time to wait between plates. Especially because it wasn't particularly busy and the components of our plates were already made eg: the lobster was precooked and the trout was smoked so assembling the items on a plate shouldn't have taken too long (time stamps attached).  Price- not good, I hadn't realized or noticed that there was a 20% automatic service charge which I think is quite high (for this particular place). We were a group of four but they were kind and they split the bill into two for us because they noticed each couple shared items. I think 17-18% service charge is more realistic. Especially because we had really slow service between our plates.\", \"I have been craving baked oysters lately and it's actually quite hard to find.   Little Shucker appeared on my search and they had a reservation opened so we gave them a try. The ambience is so cute, it's so bright and welcoming, it reminds me being inside sometimes home in some coastal town.  They tend to get busy around 6pm, so I recommend making reservations. They have a happy hour menu too, and if you want that deal you have to come before 5 pm.  For Happy Hour they have raw oysters for 12 or 24 dollars depending if you get half a dozen or a dozen.  And of course, with happy hour there's wine or beer.  For our starters we did get the dozen oysters for $24.00 along with the crudo.  The fresh oysters were good and plump.  They gave you three sauces to pair with, the green sauce was the best. The crudo was paired with their avocado mousse and tomatoes which was so tasty!  I wish they gave us more of that mousse.   We also go the baked oysters which included the rockefeller, garlic butter, and miso bone marrow.  All of these were good, but i think my favorite was the Garlic Butter, followed by the Miso Bone Marrow and then the Rockefeller.   The miso bone marrow said it had cilantro but i couldn't taste it, which was good because i'm not a cilantro fan. The Lobster roll was delicious as you can taste how buttery the bread as and how sweet and juicy the lobster was.  It does get very messy to eat but it's worth the messiness. I hope they can expand their menu soon like their sister restaurant The Snug. I would love to come back and we can tell their staff is a great team as i see them working so well together.\", 'Charming ambiance, delicious flavors, fresh seafood. Favorites were baked oyster miso bone marrow, lobster roll, and mussels.  Branzino was great as well.', \"This is a great date night or outing spot in SF. I would 100% return for the baked oysters, especially the miso bone marrow. The service was incredibly attentive and we felt the dishes were fresh & delicious. The ambiance was nice, ample spacing around the tables, lighter color palette of the restaurant makes it feel larger, and it wasn't overly loud. 10/10\", 'Summary:Casual seafood cafe offering a small variety of tasty bitesDetails:Little Shucker reminds me a bit of the seafood spots you\\'d find up in the PNW, with their casual, but creative take on various seafood dishes, albeit with a more limited offering. That\\'s not to say you can\\'t get full here if you order enough of the right dishes, but it definitely has more of a \"come here and chill with some drinks and light bites\" vibe than a \"come stuff your face and belly\" one.Everything we had was pretty tasty, but the standouts included their garlic butter baked oysters (the miso bone marrow was just a tad too salty), halibut crudo, and hot lobster rolls (which is prepared differently than their cold), all of which came with very fresh ingredients, and some tasty, yet bright flavors. And honestly, the nori cauliflower was pretty tasty too, but it felt to us like it was mostly just a bunch of tasty banchan dumped on top of roasted cauliflower lol, so the value wasn\\'t quite there on that dish.Worth a stop by, but probably more as the precursor or successor to a nearby meal.Accessibility:Can\\'t speak for the interior, but plenty of accessible outdoor seating!', \"My recent visit to little shucker in Pacific Heights had its ups and downs. While the lobster roll was meaty, it was on the pricier side and, unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations - it turned out to be rather average.On a more positive note, the Caesar salad was decent and made for a suitable companion to the lobster roll.If you're on the hunt for a great lobster roll, I'd recommend waiting for Broadstreet Oyster to open up in Ghirardelli Square or stop by New England Lobster Company when you are near SFO. The service at little shucker was good, but for a memorable lobster roll experience, it seems I might have to venture elsewhere next time.\", 'My friend brought me here for lunch for a belated birthday. This place is spectacular! All the staff was attentive, friendly, and accommodating, which made the experience so fantastic. I will be returning in the future. Shout out to everyone for such a good experience. The crudo, fried oysters, and the wine options were delightful.', \"We dined here for lunch. Our group comprised of five adults and two babies. The service couldn't have been friendlier and attentive; especially with our babies joining in on the meal. We ordered oyster shooter lights, the chips and dip, the bread, oysters in the half shell, and the crudo. We happened to be there for happy hour, so that was a pleasant surprise. The shooters were inventive and fun. Everything was presented nicely and most importantly, it was fresh!\", \"Oysters? YES! YES! YES! This new space (in the old Grove location) on Fillmore is just what the city has needed. A simple menu for indulging in fresh seafood, alongside a beautiful wine selection and bar. The restaurant is open and airy with fresh bright colors that just invoke a clean feel. Most oyster and seafood restaurants have a distinctly fishy smell, but not here, no no. We kept it simple with a couple dozen raw oysters, a couple of orders of baked oysters (who doesn't love Oysters Rockefeller?) and the Chips and Dip with the Caviar addition. I had a few Lavender Spritz that were refreshing and light. -Plenty of counter seats to watch the shuckers do their thing or table seating both indoor and outdoor-Unisex restroom -Reservations HIGHLY recommended to insure you get a seat -Service was quick and attentive JUST TREAT YOURSELF & get here if you love Oysters!\", 'Little shucker is has the cutest vibes! My partner and I love oysters so decided to give this spot a try. We got 6 oysters (2 of each type they had), the halibut crudo, mussels, and hot lobster roll. The oysters were super fresh! They give a lemongrass mignonette and two hot sauces with it. The olive oil on the crudo seemed really high quality and had such a good flavor, but honestly I thought it overpowered the halibut a little bit. The mussels were fire. The broth they were in was so delicious, and the portion was pretty big! Id say maybe around 20 mussels or so? I got fries with the mussels too, and they were super crisp and still fluffy in the middle. My partner got the lobster roll, which was good although I think the bread was a bit too buttery for me.', \"Yayyyy new oyster spot in town :-) My friend booked a dinner reservation for the 4 of us-- AMAZING OYSTERS. To my understanding, they have a rotation, featuring some from Hog Island. Very cool & hip addition to an already quite upscale area.THE BIG SHUCKER: Perfect to split with a group of 4~ All extremely fresh & high quality. NEED to try their house-made green sauce-- it's fantastic.- SMOKED SALMON TARTINE: First time trying tartine on pan de mie, soooo pillowy soft and delicious. Small portions of salmon.- ROASTED NORI CAULIFLOWER: Hearty & umami-- even when shared, the small bowl is surprisingly filling- LOBSTER ROLL (hot): Ngl this is ok. $35 is high for a lobster roll... Tasty, but nothing insane.Only tried the seafood as we had 2 pescatarians in tow-- will need to come back to try the bone marrow another time.\", 'This place really did live up to the hype! So glad we came. What a lovely weekend brunch. I rarely give out 5 stars but this place was very deserving. My sisters and I had been dying to visit this place after it showed up all over instagram and had such great reviews. We came yesterday at noon. It was pretty quiet tbh - their dinner reservations are much harder to get!We ordered a ton of delicious food -- the big shucker, which was great, everything was fresh and amazing -- the salmon tartine, also amazing, and I got the lavender spritz and the lobster roll (warm with butter vs. cold) and added caviar. The spritz was almost too pretty to drink but man was it good! And the lobster roll was absolutely amazing. Maybe just a tad too much butter, but all in all so good. And they give you so much caviar as well! Not cheap but definitely really good and the service was phenomenal as well.', 'Came for happy hour on a Thursday around 4:30pm with a friend. Most tables and seats were full but the hostess found us a spot in their stand room area. Drinks: NA spritze - was good, sweet with a hint of bitterness wish this had a little more acidity to balance the sweetness but still enjoyable Food: Raw Oysters - fresh small to medium sized oysters with a slight salinity, served with lemon wedges, mignonette and hot sauce, there was a bit of shell and grit in some of the oysters Baked miso bone marrow oysters - really tasty, larger in size, creamy and rich with some fattiness from the bone marrow and savory umami from the miso Service was fine, pretty busy during happy hour but  servers came by regularly to check in. The hostess brought out water when we were first seated. Overall a decent spot for oyster happy hour. You can only order oysters and drinks in the bars standing area so if you want a full meal definitely grab a reservation.']\n",

      "Reviews: ['The overall ambiance was great in this restaurant and I loved the dining experience. We will definitely be coming back', 'This place was an ideal choice for an outdoor gathering with friends after a long week. The ordering process involved using a QR code and presenting your ID at the host stand (which initially struck me as odd, but the waiter proceeded to check IDs anyway). This system made it convenient for everyone to settle their bills individually in a group setting.I would rate it 4 out of 5, mainly because it was on the expensive side, but the food and drinks truly hit the mark. The pork buns, in particular, were a delightful surprise, offering a pleasing combination of sweet and spicy flavors with the addition of shaved jalapeños and marinated fatty pork. The tater tots were delicious, especially when paired with alternating dips of ketchup and yuzu mayo. While the Paloma slush was enjoyable, I plan to try the popular prickly pear next time.', \"Came here for a friends birthday on the weekend night and was seating at one of the larger tables. It seems the upstairs section was not open for the night, and it was packed. However, even though it was packed, we received subpar service. My friend who is a regular there was a bit surprised at the lack of timely service. I didn't think the staff was overwhelmed, with some of them seeing to take a lax approach to the night when I personally would have thought they would be checking in on tables or checking for patrons that were looking for a server to place order and waiting minutes.I got one of their coffee espressos (the name might be off), but its was delicious and worth the expectations that my friend had set.I enjoyed my time here and probably would come back!\", '3.5 rounded to 4 stars. Nice location, pretty great ambiance. You could order your drinks by scanning the QR code, we had a hard time finding the code because it was pretty small and taped to the side of the table. We had the Chamomile gin and Coconut daiquiri, both were pretty meh in my opinion. I was expecting the drinks to have more depth of flavor but they just straight up tasted bitter. I think the Chamomile gin was a bit lighter and had more flavor. In addition, each drink came up to $18 including tax and the gratitude fee which was on a more pricey side.', \"I definitely kept it snug at The Snug! It's up to par with other cocktail bars in the area but I do feel like they have their own hits and misses.My companion took me here after I got off work. The spot is spacious and clean with seating at the bar and tables in one area. Or a communal table and window seating on the other side. They also have plenty of outdoor seating. We chose to sit by the windows which beckoned natural light and a place to people watch. My main gripe is the 20% automated tip considering there is zero service from start to finish. You sit down, order and pay using their QR code, and receive your food and drinks from a runner--no interactions whatsoever which is sucky.Their QR code leads you to their lunch, dinner, and libations menu. Its comfort American and California fare is on the pricier end. Plus uniquely crafted cocktails. I enjoyed my drink and the Tots my companion and I shared--super crispy, not soggy, and good quality. We got Ketchup and Yuzu Mayo on the side. The Yuzu Mayo was phenomenally creamy and you could clearly taste the citrusy flavor. One more is they charge for their sauces so it does get costly!This is a solid option for a drink and bites for those in the Pac Heights or the surrounding area. Parking is on the street off Fillmore or surrounding areas. Ideal for pairs or small and large groups as it's inviting and roomy. Personally, I won't become a regular as the food and drinks are overpriced considering there's no service and a mandatory surcharge, but I'll come back on special occasions!\", 'Came for post dinner drinks And will 100% come here againVery well executed drinksGreat breadth of speciality cocktails Cute ambiancePlenty of seating - inside and out Attentive waitstaff', \"I love coming here to grab drinks with friends during the week. The prickly pear is my favorite cocktail here. The Snug also has solid bar food so we'll usually order a few things to share (tots, popcorn chicken, fried chicken sandwich, and brussel sprouts are some of our typical suspects) Great spot on Fillmore!\", \"First time here! Got the aloe vera mocktail and crispy zucchini. The mocktail was really good and I love the glassware it came in. The crispy zucchini was okay. I'm not sure how much I like the dipping sauce though but the zucchini itself was well seasoned. Love that they expanded their parklet and that you can pay your tab individually by QR code (or keep your tab open and add more things). Each table in the parklet as its own heater though not sure how hot it gets as it is high up. Service was really quick and they continuously cleared our empty glasses and tableware. Tip is already automatically added when you ordered so no need to leave a tip on the table or pay it separately.\", 'Fried Chicken Sandwich is the reason I go here. Along with the fantastic cocktails. I trust the ingredients and the cocktails can be with or without alcohol.', \"We came here on Friday night for some drinks and dinner and were seated right away. FYI you order on QR code stuck on the table and keep an online tab that way.  A 20% gratuity fee is automatically added instead of tipping and the hostess also lets you know before you sit down. My friend got their Prickly Pear cocktail and I got their Margarita. She got a burger and we split some of their tater tots. The food is nothing super unique but it tastes really good. I think they are more known for their drinks. The prickly pear cocktail doesn't really have any taste to it other than the mezcal and the spice. It was hard to tell if the burn was coming from the spice of the jalepeno or if it was the alcohol in the drink. The margarita however, was pretty solid - it tasted perfectly tart from the lime and very refreshing. Overall it's a great place to come and have drinks with a friend.\", \"What a perfect spot to dine outside with friends after a long week! You QR code to order and show your ID at the host stand (which I thought was odd but as the waiter then proceeded to check anyways) so it's easy to pay for your own items as a group. Ranked a 4/5 because it was very pricey but the food and drinks overall hit the spot. The pork buns were surprisingly flavorful and packed a nice sweet and spicy punch with the shaved jalapeños and marinated fatty pork. The tater tots were delicious especially when alternating between ketchup and yuzu mayo. The Paloma slush was solid but will definitely try the prickly pear nest them as it seems to be a popular drink!\", 'What a cool place to hang out and have a bite and a cocktail. Great atmosphere and wonderful service.', \"This place gave off pretentious but damn did they really change my mind! The food is a bit pricey but the quality of the ingredients and put together was worth it. I got the pork belly buns and they melted in my mouth, cousin for wagyu burger and she went to heaven! My mom got the chicken salad and said it was the best salad she had had in years! The drinks were my ONE gripe. The cool rectangular prism looks awesome in the glass but you take it out and discover their is only actually a quarter cup of drink in their. So disappointed so I bring myself to in a very salty attitude take the glass to try it and it was SO GOOD. UGH haha! The spa water was very refreshing and perfect mixed and it instantly made me annoyed I couldn't continue being salty haha! Great spot! Will be back for pork belly buns and spa water!\", \"The food was good,  we had the Hummus, which was really good! The burger was on point as well.  They only had a couple of beers on tap but Pliny the Elder made up for it. The  music playlist was nice, 90's vibe. Overall was a nice place for a quick bite or to hang out.\", \"I've been to the snug about three times now and it has been a solid place. They have a self-serve QR code ordering system which you order from and the food is brought directly to the table where you scanned your code at which I thought was very cool there is a 20% automatic gratuity tacked on at the end of your bill which hikes up the prices and was a bit much for me and the single burger and popcorn chicken we got. The wagyu burger though, is pretty solid! The star of the show was the dijonaise and carmelized onions, absolutely delicious.  I'd come again but only for a special occasion.\", 'Extremely rude manager with man bun/ponytail.

By no means the best fried chicken sandwich ever, but had good flavor - Squash Tempura: this was really delicious - would recommend ordering this.- Popcorn chicken: always a good hit, especially with the yuzu MayoMiscellaneous:- Indoor dining and outdoor parklet dining available- Typical SF availability for parking - Love that you can have your own tab from the QR code if you want (makes paying the bill easier at the end)', 'Great place for a drink with your partner or group of friends!

They even decorated it with nice foliage, and it felt as welcoming as if we had gotten a seat insideThe service was very professional and they took great care of us, our waiter helped us with the wine selection, and was accomodating when we asked to try a few of the options before committingThe food though really blew my mind.

It's five courses - crudo, broth, pasta, entree and dessert.  The crudo was Kombu cured Kampachi.  The broth was a squash veloute. The first two courses came with their bread course.  The pastas were the red kabocha squash caramelle, lamb risotto and ricotta gnudi.  The entrees were roasted black cod, Berkshire pork collar and A5 wagyu. They also brought farro and cabbage to share.  The desserts were Hojicha opera sponge cake and the apple crumb cake.  The A5 wagyu was the highlight of the meal for me.  The other standouts were the caramelle pasta, the bread, the cabbage and the Hojicha opera cake. The server overheard that one of our friends was gluten-sensitive and they brought out some gluten-free variations (bread, lamb risotto instead of tagliatelle and apple crumb cake).  I love the initiative here. Service was definitely at a Michelin-level and I love the neighborhood gem feeling.  We were comfortably seated in a heated outdoor space in the back. It's the perfect ambiance for a nice date or a dinner with friends.  The base tasting menu was $87 before tax and tip.  The A5 was $40 extra and the truffle was another $25 (both of these are great values).  We had a few drinks so this ended up being around $180 per person.  They automatically include the 20% service charge.  This is definitely a Michelin-star level dining experience.  Highly, highly recommended!!!\", \"Finally, i got to come to 7 Adam. I've been waiting since the chef left Marlena and I have also tried their food before when they were doing pop-up. Which was really good. We got a spot at 5.30 right when they open the restaurant.The menu here it's prix fixe meal for 5 courses ( you could add supplement dishes , which I did ) will reveal it also for the price of 87$ The restaurant is really nice and modern, they have a patio space in the back which is beautiful. Really I like the light of the place. The staffs and service are top notch , really professional and take really good care of us. They started us off with warm bread and culture butter. Let's begin the menu First dish : charred broccolini, love the Smokey flavor and sweet from the broccolini and umami saltiness from mullet roe.Second dish : kanpachi cured with Kombu, fish was fresh and love the sauce , the dashi and yuzu flavored was my favorite Third dish : we had 3 different dishes and 1 of them is the supplement. First one was the red Kabocha caramelle, my favorite. The flavor combination is awesome. My wife favorite was lamb tagliatelle, pasta was perfectly al dente and love the sour flavor that come through with the richness lamb ragu. The supplement dish was ricotta ghudi with white truffle, if you enjoy richness of cheese and white truffle, this might be your favorite dish.The main : we ordered supplement which was the A5 wagyu , of course it's good but surprisingly, my favorite was the chicken, so moist, so tender , the sauce is so good.The dessert : hojicha chocolate cake and apple crumble cake , they're both nice but I was just still happy with the chicken haha. Really really recommended this place. The price is great and the food even better. Next year Michelin star. Better hurry up and try it before they get too busy.\", \"Came by for dinner the other night and it was a decent experience. 7 Adams is run by the couple David and Serena from Marlena in Bernal Heights that had 1 Michelin star. Made a reservation via Resy and our table was ready upon arrival.Parking in the Fillmore area is easy as there is always the Japantown parking garage in case street parking is unavailable. The interior of the restaurant has been recently remodelled with front of the house wearing their own attire and back of the house wearing a 7 Adams t-shirt and some staff opting to wear a mask.Dining in the late fall, the draft from the door made the dining experience a touch chilly. The lighting in the restaurant was dim, which made eating some courses a touch tricky, especially with dark bowls for certain courses. The light at the table was helpful, especially for pictures.Dining was available indoors or outdoors in the heated patio.Started off with the kombu cured kampachi and this was a delicate and refreshing way to start off the meal. Moved on to the charred broccoli di ciccio and the flavors and cookking skill were world class. Excellent 2nd course.Opted for the ricotta gnudi with a $18 supplement and it was decent. The truffle was flavorful although the pasta might have been a touch overcooked as it was no longer al dente.Opted for the A5 wagyu ribeye with a $40 supplemnt and it was fantastic! The ribeye was seared on the outside and came out rare. The au jus complemented this perfectly. The beef tongue was braised and super tender and flavorful. The side of mushrooms were a delight too!The farro verde for the table was good although I preferred the glazed arrohead cabbage even more as the flavoring and cooking made this rather pedestian side stand out!The disappointment of the evening were the desserts. Both the hojicha opera and apple crumb cake didn't taste fresh. Both the cakes tasted a touch stale and definitely dry. I recalled desserts at Marlena that were much fresher and higher caliber. ~$160/head after tax, 20% service charge, and 6% SF mandates.\", 'Fantastic new restaurant in the Fillmore neighborhood offering a prix fixe seasonal, five course tasting menu with a  fusion of modern cuisines (our meal had Japanese, Italian, and Californian influences). Everything was delicious, especially the kombu cured kampachi, red kabocha squash caramelle, lamb tagliatelle, and A5 wagyu ribeye!Service and ambience were equally solid.  If they keep this up, they\\'ll  definitely get a Michelin Star soon, so go now before prices jump!Note that while they advertise a $87 per person tasting menu, because they include a 28.24% mandatory tip/service, it ends up being $111.57 before tax, and $119.07 after tax. Honestly, the meal is amazing and worth every penny. The servers and staff deserve that amazing tip. But I think it\\'s unethical to misrepresent additional fees and try to distort pricing to feel lower to increase demand, so I\\'m lowering my rating by 1 star until they fix that.=== NOTE ON PRICING ===First, let me say that the restaurant business is hard, especially in an inflationary environment with increasingly high costs of capital. Servers and staff deserve higher pay, job protection, healthcare, commuter benefits, and more, and the entrepreneurs and investors also deserve an opportunity for return on their hard work/investment. However, I also believe that restaurant guests deserve honest, transparent pricing. And these don\\'t have to be mutually exclusive goals.Unfortunately, SF restaurants seem to be aligning on deceptive practices and hidden fees to raise revenue, rather than simply raising prices.Here\\'s how this looks at 7 Adams for just the meal (no drinks or supplements)$87 per person meal20% mandatory tip = $17.405% \"SF Mandate\" surcharge = $4.36 [see note below][=[But they actually calculate the surcharge on top of the tip, so it\\'s really 6%]1% extra surcharge = $0.878.625% SF Tax = $7.50[But they actually calculate tip on top of the now 26% surcharges]2.243% SF Tax Overcharge = $1.95Total: $119.07I\\'m actually okay with a 20% mandatory service charge / tip - 20% is the norm (in fact, often folks tip as high as 25% or 30%), and no one likes to end the meal with math. Plus, as I said, servers deserve the 20% tip. (But this should not be included in the tax calculation.)But the SF Mandate Charges are a total scam. And the fact that they claim it\\'s 5% when it\\'s actually 6% is annoying.  See below for my note on these fees.And then they calculate the SF 8.625% SF sales tax ON TOP of the now 26% included service fees. (Typically tipping is done on the pre-tax subtotal.)Please, @7Adams staff, please just raise your prices to include all your fees. Your staff absolutely deserve healthcare, commuter benefits, and a higher wage, but those should be priced into the menu, not added after the fact.=== NOTE ON SF MANDATES ===This is NOT a tax, fee, or charge imposed by the city!Instead, San Francisco requires that businesses provide minimum benefits to employees, such as an $18.07 minimum wage, commuter benefits, and healthcare benefits for businesses over 20 employees. Restaurants should already have been offering these benefits (and many were). These labor costs should be paid out of the revenues generated, and so should factor into setting the menu prices - the way any business considers costs (both marginal/COGS and fixed/avg) in the price of goods. However, SF restaurants feared that raising prices would reduce demand, so instead they began quietly adding a surcharge to bills. These charges can be a flat fee or a percent of the bill, and range from 1% to 6%. They go by many names, including \"Health SF Tax\" or \"SF Employer Mandates.\" Many visitors, especially tourists, are surprises to find this additional charge on the bill, but assume it is a city tax. Research has shown that guests order more food than they would have if these added costs were included in the menu prices, which is precisely why restaurants continue to hide bake in more fees, rather than raise menu prices. But this is unethical and deceptive and we San Franciscans need to start pushing back. Over the past couple of years, I\\'ve seen these fees go up from 1 or 2% to now averaging about 5%. Enough is enough.It\\'s particularly bad for a new restaurant, like 7 Adams, to have these fees, because they just set their prices after these mandates were in place. I could understand for restaurants who set their prices 5+ years ago to charge a surcharge cover these new business costs, but for new restaurants, they should have priced the menu factoring in healthcare benefits and minimum wage ordinances.', 'We came the week they opened and they did not disappoint! We loved every dish and left every dish completely cleaned off. Really great value for their pre fixe menu. Also their bread and butter were so good, I wish we could get more! Service was great, super friendly and attentive. The ambiance is cozy and great place for a date night. Highly recommend!', \"Finally got here. Like many I was shocked by the sudden closure of Marlena. It was fantastic and thought it was well on its way to being an SF favorite along the lines of Third Cousin; intimate, Michelin quality, and fantastic staff.  Sad to hear there was some sort of falling out between the Chefs and the major investor.  I don't see how such a success could have such problems.  Profit and quality appeared to be going hand-in-hand. I for one would love to know all the gory details. But enough with gossip mongering.  Let's talk turkey, or in this case, tagliatelle, ricotta gnudi, and Berkshire pork collar. And Wagyu, that king of beef. First, the tagliatelle was to die for, but the pork collar was to live for. And what's life without that ever so tasty wagyu.  Add three excellent wines by the glass and it's a perfect meal. But don't forget the secret menu, as for the superb spicy boneless chicken wing, which a friend tells me is a homage to Chef Fisher's hometown of Buffalo.  Pro tip, get the supplements and enjoy.\", \"From the moment I stepped into 7Adams, I knew I was in for an extraordinary culinary experience. Nestled in a charming corner of The City, this new restaurant has already set high standards in the world of fine dining, hinting at a future graced with a Michelin star.The ambiance of 7Adams strikes a perfect balance between elegance and comfort. Its decor, a harmonious blend of modern and traditional elements, creates a welcoming yet upscale atmosphere. The staff was attentive and knowledgeable this ensured a seamless dining experience.The highlight of 7Adams is undoubtedly its tasting menu. Each dish was a masterpiece of flavors, textures, and presentation. The menu, which changes seasonally, showcases the freshest local ingredients, each prepared with innovative techniques and artistic flair. The chefs at 7Adams clearly have a deep respect for their craft, and it shines through in every bite..While 7Adams is yet to receive its first Michelin star, the quality of food, service, and overall experience suggests that it is only a matter of time. This restaurant is not just a meal; it's a culinary adventure that leaves a lasting impression. Highly recommended for anyone seeking a dining experience that tantalizes the senses and celebrates the art of fine seasonal cuisine.\", 'We had high hopes but unfortunately pretty disappointed.  Food was decent but not amazing.  We upgraded to the wagyu steak and the portion was really small for $40.  Black cod was cooked extremely well, but they put too much salt that made it inedible and smelled too fishy.  Dessert was really bad, also having one restroom in the restaurant made for a constant line.  On the plus side, service was Michelin star status and ambience was really nice.']\n",

      "Reviews: ['Usually go with the tasting menu which currently is $85/person. Today we tried a couple dishes but the stand outs were the oysters, snapper, and chickpea fritters  (always get the fritters).Snapper doneness was perfection. Oysters with mignonette were on point, and the chickpea fritters always kill it.I was really happy with a 6:15pm Tuesday reservation since it was more intimate (not as loud) and we got to see the space transition from well lit to a dim lit situation. Service is always great. Glad to be in the neighborhood.', \"I took a friend here for a milestone birthday recently and absolutely loved the experience and the food was delicious. I love the warm ambiance of Frances, and its small, cozy interior only helps to accentuate the warmth of the whole place. I loved the chef's tasting menu because tbh I didn't expect to be that full and it was insane amounts of value. Some bites to start, a salad, a pasta, and then an additional ginormous entree and side to share AND dessert. I can't express the portions of food we got, and of course each dish was incredible.I also really enjoyed the wine variety, and definitely plan for a good 2-3 hour meal!\", \"Last minute decision to go here and I really liked it, didn't love it, really liked it. First off, the front of house staff were lovely, very friendly and very capable. They made some very kind accommodations for my partner and I, such as adding another table as the single table was a little small for us. Thank you. The crudo was lovely as was the caviar, both were served in high sided vessels which made them awkward to eat from. Then came the oysters, they were obviously plated hours earlier and I say this for several reasons. 1, the mignonette that was supposed to be present was missing however the diced pickly bits were there. 2, there was no sign of the oysters delicious original liquor. 3, you would think that would mean all those fluids were sitting on the plate. Nope. 4, we asked for some more mignonette and we received some lemon wedges, so whatever mignonette they may have had was gone. 5, the oysters were dry and stuck to the shell. They were also angled pointy end down, so whatever fluids they had or were dressed with had no chance of making it to the table. The seaweed Caesar was delicious as was the watermelon gazpacho. My main was the snapper it was a fantastic dish, the fish was cooked perfectly and the accompaniments were texturally great, with beautiful flavors. My partner's cassoulet was delicious. It's a little stark inside, the current trend but you feel like you're in a bustling, happening restaurant. Nice. I wish I could have given place 4.5 stars because although the oysters were far from good, everything else was very nice.\", 'The best place in the neighborhood in SF!  Love it!  Excellent service.  Great good - always!  Brilliant location.  Awesome atmosphere.  The food is to die for!', \"Unpopular opinion and maybe it was just me. - Watermelon Gazpacho: the lemon was overpowering the soup. The melon and candied walnut were good, added to the texture. I didn't taste wintermelon at all. Quite disappointed with it - Campanelle, zucchini pesto: very light, not too creamy. I wished it had a little more sauce. Some bites didn't have enough sauce and I was just eating the boiled pasta.- Tamal, roasted okra, red mole: not bad but I won't get it again. The mole was spicy, which I liked. The rest of the dish felt  like it missed something.- Brentwood corn with black sesame hummus: ironically I liked this the most. The corn was sweet, grilled with flavors. The sesame hummus was a little confusing.The restaurant was small and tables were put too close to one another. Even if you spoke softly, the next table would hear. It was pretty uncomfortable.\", \"Did the pre fix menu and can't say enough positive things about it! Portion sizes were awesome, food was delicious in flavor and texture was ON POINT! They accommodated both gluten free and vegan which was appreciated. Everything was truly exceptional. The vegan pasta dish was truly one of the best things I've ever eaten. So al dente, so good. The vegan option instead of the halibut crisp (forget the name) was also worth noting. I slurped up the vinaigrette sauce because it was that good. Def had no business doing that but you know, that's life. Def check it out! Ambiance/decor was also very vibey, trendy but soft. The staff was super friendly and patient with our big group.\", \"Love this neighborhood spot. Came here to celebrate our five year anniversary and everyone was so kind :) Was bummed the carbonara was no longer on the menu, but the corn soup, fries, and cod were so good I forgot all about it! Lumberjack cake was out of this world, we almost ordered another since we didn't want to share! Will definitely be back- thank you Frances for the incredible evening.\", 'Came by for dinner the other night and it was a phenomenal world class experience. Made a reservation and our table was ready upon arrival. Frances is located in the Castro district close to the Castro Muni station and street parking seemed to be available. Dining options appeared to be outdoor patio, counter, or main dining room. Having dined a couple times at Octavia, I had high expectations. Staff wore uniforms and some even wore a mask. Service started off with holding coats or other items in the coat closet.Opted for the $85 tasting menu and did the add-on with sourdough which was tasty with the cultured butter.The first course of appetizers as other Yelpers had mentioned, felt a touch rushed, especially with the small table. Started off with the cabbage soup which was fragrant. I loved how the grated horseradish provided nice contast to the soup.The rockfish crudo was a light and refreshing way to enjoy the first course. The roasted carrots were very sweet and fragrant. I loved how the seasoned kale was crispy, providing a fantastic contrast.The second course consisted of the gem lettuce which came out as a mega portion. Lettuce was super fresh and the vinaigrette was super light. The pasta course might have been my favorite of the evening with perfectly al dente lumache pasta with a contrasting textures and flavors from the mushrooms and other accoutrements. The main course consisted of a generous few slices of rather lean and well cooked pieces of NY steak. I personally would have preferred a cut of beef that had more marbling.Evening ended off with the dark chocolate brownie which was a masterpiece with contrasting textures, especially wtih the pistachio bark and pomegranate honey ice cream.~$120/head after tax and 6% employer mandates.', \"Went to Frances for Christmas Eve dinner and was happy with the courses. Service was good but not great given the price point - on two occasions the next course was brought to the table when our completed dish plates had not yet been removed and no one checked in with us to ask how we were doing/how the meal was. I will say however the wine pours were very generous so that was appreciated. The last course of prime rib was delicious. I agree with another review regarding the restaurant space, it is small and feels very cramped. There's also only one restroom so more time was spent waiting in a line to use the restroom than I'd prefer during a nice meal. Overall a really good meal and experience.\", \"Food is amazing and excellent. Service is good. Ambiance is natural and free. The only thing is, it's hard to park and snag a table.\", \"This is a really great hidden gem in the heart of San Francisco. The food is really good all around. We had more than half the menu and it was all fantastic. The inside and outside restaurant itself is really simple which makes you focus on the food. The service is really great too. Always checking in and making sure you have what you need. My favorite dish was the chickpea fries. Like nothing I've ever had. Their wine selection is also very diverse from all over the world.\", \"We tried the tasting menu which was 7-8items.  I enjoyed the Majority of the food except for the last one: the cod. It was like half cooked and I don't know not Miso cod and had a fishy taste to it. I couldn't eat it.  Everything else was so good though. There was halibut which was amazing with the peach slices. The little gem and chickory salad was amazing!  I loved the reginette/la spinetta Sangiovese pasta. It had a slight lemon flavor to it and was just delightful.   I'm Not a huge fan of desert so didnt like it but everyone else at the table Loved it. Ironically the bread and butter was also a favorite.I enjoyed this meal except for the cod. That just missed it entirely for me.\", \"This was my first time visiting Frances since COVID, during which they did an extensive remodel. I miss the cozy, relaxed vibe of the old Frances - which had a buzzy, local neighborhood bistro feel. The new Frances is cool and austere, leaning more towards a fine dining vibe. The food remains exceptional -- contemporary California at its best -- so as long as you know what you're getting into, I still think it deserves 5 stars.Went with friends - four people total. Seated promptly and was easy to hold a conversation the entire time, even when the place was at full capacity. We decided to order a la carte and share everything. Started with some bread and cocktails/wines by the glass. All came out promptly. The cocktails (they dont have a full license, just wine beer) were ho hum, but great variety of sparkles and whites by the glass and we had some delicious surprises (hello Listan Blanco!). Bottle list is equally diverse in range of price and style. None of us are vegetarian, but we ended up ordering a completely veg. Everything was deeply satisfying. All well prepared, featuring great local ingredients and suprising flavor combinations, from the tomato salad to the chamomile pavlova. Every plate was licked clean. We ordered 10 dishes total (including the bread and desserts). It was totally enough for the four of us.I would say this: portions are on the smaller side -- some like tapas and some like small entrees. But two dishes per person and two desserts for the table were enough for us. A hungry person might want to get three dishes. Still, with wine, dessert, and tip, we made it out of there for $120/person, and for that level of food and service -- more upscale than a local neighborhood joint but not an all-out fine dining extravaganza -- I thought it was great value for the experience.\", 'Beautiful, cozy spot. I celebrated my anniversary at Frances this week. Service was super friendly, professional, yet approachable. The food was delicious, specially the tamal . Bread plate with butter and sea salt was to die for.Wine list has plenty of options at any price point. Overall a great experience. Cannot wait to go back.', 'Came here for my 30th birthday and what a treat. They were offering a tasting menu that night so we were able to sample each item in the menu.All were fantastic! And the bartender made some great wine pairing selections. Overall a great dinner', 'I appreciate the fact that you receive a generous portion of food for the price, unlike some pricier restaurants where you typically receive a small serving.', 'This is a great place to go if you want to spend $14 on a small bowl of beans or $40 for two small slivers of steak! I was impressed when the waitress encouraged us to order 6 items on the menu, but I quickly understood why 6 items would be necessary once the tiny portions came out. Food quality was good enough but not better than any randomly selected Thai or Indian place in town, and certainly not worth twice the price.', 'Happy Anniversary 13years Bravo  Chef Everything amazing everyone super professional and friendly', \"Incredible food, generous portions, friendly and attentive service. Vegetable forward dishes, farm to table, robust and balanced flavors. Cozy and upscale ambience, perfect for date night. This would be a regular spot for us if it weren't so hard to get tables :)\", \"Had dinner with my wife at Frances last weekend.  I really could not have been more pleased with the experience.  Great outdoor seating, lovely staff and service, and the food was fabulous.  Definitely an elevated dining experience.  Exquisite food.Menu is clearly thoughtful and opinionated, in the sense that Frances has an idea about what it's food is about.  Flavors are rich but subtle. Every dish considered.A really great meal served in an elegant but low key atmosphere.  I have nothing but praise for Frances.  Thank you for a wonderful evening!\"]\n",

We went at night and were fortunate to get a window seat with direct view spanning the Wharf area with the new ferris wheel all the way to the Golden Gate. Very beautiful.Although being in a major tourist location, the restaurant with sitting bar acts and runs like a well oiled mid range establishment you would find in any downtown loacation. We had a 15 minute wait so we sat at the bar and had a drink, I recommend the Fog Harbor Lager if you like the easy drinking stuff.Our menu:Blue cheese bread - buttery, cheesy, garlicky goodness. Will always order this!Crab cakes - Super fresh and meaty.Clam Chowder - amongst the best we have had in SF.Cioppino - No noodles, just fish. Extremely fresh and amazing fish with garlic toast in a tomato broth. Sooo good. As for Shawn, our waiter, he should be next up for employee of the month because he was personal, interactive and made us laugh. Bravo sir!The prices are a tiny bit scary not Halloween scary, actually very reasonable for a tourist area.\", \"Food: I had the clams and linguini and I was so pumped to try it as I love to order this at other restaurants. But, I wasnt as satisfied as I wanted to be. There wasn't too much flavor and it tasted a bit bland. I suppose the upside was that it had quite a bit of clam meat and the noodles were cooked nicely. They definitely just need to work on the flavor of the dish. I hear the clam chowder is what I need to get next time so maybe I will order that and give this place another shot. Service: The service here was honestly meh. Our server wasnt really personable and didnt even make any recommendations. He just asked if we knew what we wanted. Also, I saw that he asked other tables if they wanted dessert and even brought them a tray of selections but he didnt offer us any. I was waiting to see if he was ever going to mention as most restaurants do and he just brought the check. Definitely service could use a bit of work here. Ambiance: The ambiance was very nice! The table we were sat at was near the window which had a very nice view. You could see the alcatraz from inside along with the water! I also appreciated all the Christmas decor!\", 'Our server was fantastic and other staff was friendly. Another employee stopped by to help me tie my bib.

The pasta complimented the rest of the meal- yummy!Pleasantly intimate atmosphere for being in a touristy spot.', \"Hubby and I recently got the chance to try out Fog Harbor Fish House! It's been on our list of spots to check out in SF for awhile. Luckily, his sister has been here several times and spoke very highly of this restaurant.RESERVATIONS: Recommended! Fog Harbor is top rated on Yelp when you search SF. It's in a prime location therefore we highly suggest making reservations.AMBIANCE: Casual with amazing views of the bay. The restaurant has big glass windows around its entirety overlooking the bay. Even on their patio, they have dividers that give you privacy but you also get beautiful views of the bay and the bridge. MENU/FOOD: They have a large selection of foods as well as a seasonal menu. The average prices were $20-$50 per plate. We each opted for their clam chowder and also for their lobster ravioli, clam linguine with alfredo sauce, and mixed grill. All of these items came in fairly large portions, large enough to share. The clam chowder here is very delicious. Very creamy and loaded with so much clam. They gave complimentary sourdough rolls which complemented the chowder. The clam linguine is also creamy and the linguine is cooked to a perfect al dente. The lobster ravioli was superb. The ravioli skin was soft and held flavorful bites of lobster with ricotta. The lobster tasted so fresh! As for the mixed grill, it was our favorite! We substituted the shrimp for more salmon. The salmon was very tender and the seasoning on the salmon was out of this world. We couldn't get enough of it! The mashed potatoes were very creamy and the grilled vegetables were very refreshing with a hint of lemon. OVERALL EXPERIENCE: Easily one of our top favorite restaurants at SF officially. We understand the high ratings behind Fog Harbor now. The food is outstanding and the service was great. They were very accommodating towards us by opening their patio for us to enjoy a meal with our pug. Even though we were the only party outside, our waitress made sure we were well taken care of. We couldn't stop talking about the amazing food and experience here at Fog Harbor. We will always stop by here anytime we visit SF moving forward!\", \"I went in with pretty high expectations for the food since it's a really well known restaurant at Pier 39, but left feeling pretty mediocre about the food, service, and ambiance. The food was okay, nothing amazing but nothing bad. The mussels were super different and had a sweet onion sauce to pair with it. It felt too heavy and too sweet to go with the mussels and fries. The fish and chips and clam chowder were pretty standard. Due to the extreme stuffiness where we were sitting, I couldn't stomach the apple crumble at the end and just wanted to leave for fresh air. Our waitress wasn't super friendly either, and just all-in-all left me feeling super meh about the place. It's definitely one of those places that feels more geared towards tourists.\", \"I was finally able to come back to this fantastic restaurant and this time, I brought nine family members with me. I spent the day talking this place up and hoped they wouldn't make a liar out of me.I'm happy to report that they lived up to the hype once again. Everybody at the table, including my mom who's a bit picky, loved Fog Harbor.I went with a cup of the clam chowder (never come here without ordering at least the cup) as a starter and the filet mignon with potato mash and wilted spinach as my entree.I've been to many steak houses and can honestly say the filet mignon I had here was among the best I've had. It was cooked to perfection and while I don't feel it needed it, the delicious demi glaze took it up a notch.We're currently planning a trip to the city this spring with our closest friends for their anniversary and I've already decided to treat them to dinner here. Seriously, I can't say enough. Great experience every time.\", 'We\\'re giving FOG HARBOR the TOP Five 5 Star rating based on a few factors.First off, it has to fight the stigma of residing in Pier 39, known by locals in SF as a \"tourist trap\" type location.  It\\'s actually high quality as an experience and the food portions, taste and prices are fair.  We were expecting to be gauged and get sub-part quality being at Pier 39.If this relocated to any other area in SF, it would probably be at the top of many local\\'s lists, especially if parking was easy and traffic wasn\\'t gridlocked to get to.So, if you\\'re a tourist and see this place and worry about it being questionable with so many other choices, the right decision is to look at the menu first and if you see stuff you like, go here and don\\'t roll the dice on other places which may not give you a solid experience as Fog Harbor does and has/had for us.We\\'re locals in SF but came with visiting tourists, and everyone was happy.We had the Clam Chowder and one comment on the table was it wasn\\'t \"Salty\" (a negative would be being salty) and that it was served \"Hot\" (and that\\'s a good trait to be piping hot and allowed to cool down rather than come warm and end up being cold.We had the Halibut, Sole and Swordfish without any complaints and completely empty plates after indulging in the entrees.Yeah, they charge the dreaded \"5% SF Employee Mandate \"Tax\" Surcharge\" which I think all San Francisco restaurants do, on top of the 8.625% sales tax then whatever you end up tipping... so you are leaving paying 30%+ more than the menu list price on everything.  That\\'s more of a comment on the state of San Francisco\\'s policies than anything this restaurant can control or is at any blame for.The service was friendly, fast and accommodating.  They asked about food allergies and tastes/dislikes ahead of ordering, being very conscientious of their customers needs.They give complimentary rolls and butter which is always a huge plus never to be taken for granted.On a weekend night, you can find street parking for under $1 an hour as opposed to parking in the Pier 39 parking structure or paid parking lots.I\\'d recommend this spot to all.', \"This restaurant is so beautiful as you get to sit right by the pier. The waiters are so friendly and will provide great service. This place is such a great date spot or a nice place to eat. The seafood here is so fresh. Seared Pacific Cod - 4/5- the garbanzo beans overpowered the cod itself however if you ate the cod on its own with the aioli it tastes amazing. the fish was so fresh which made this dish more rich and flavorful. I'd highly recommended this if you are craving cod. Shrimp Brochette - 5/5- the shrimp was beautifully cooked. the butter had such a rich smell and when you put it on the shrimp it tasted amazing. the mashed potatoes were a bit bland but the green beans were cooked so well. Crab Ravioli- 4/5- the ravioli itself was very cheesy and the crab pieces on top tasted amazing. the whole dish was amazing overall but it was a bit too greasy for me. you also only get 4 large pieces of ravioli Calamari- 5/5- you could tell the calamari is fresh and not stored in the frozen fridge for over a month. it had a nice texture and it was perfectly fried.Overall i would come back here because the food is amazing and the ambience is so nice.\", 'Such a wonderful spot! We got the clam chowder bowl with the sourdough bread and crab meat. This was my first time trying clam chowder and we absolutely loved it. We accompanied our lunch with calamari. I would definitely come here again and recommend to anyone checking Pier 39 out! Wait was 15-20 minutes to be seated on a Saturday in November, so not at all bad.', 'We asked Google where to find the best clam chowder. We were not disappointed. Everything was great.First off, our server \"Bong Jovi\" was delightful. Very helpful and very attentive. Old school service at a great venue.Everyone was helpful. The restaurant was full, but everyone was attentive. Our used plates were quickly cleared by whoever happened to walk by. Even the manager stopped by to ask how our meal was, and HE took a plate.We started with crab cakes (amazing) and blue cheese bread (delicious).Claim chowder was the best we\\'ve ever had. It had the texture of mashed potatoes,  and the most amazing tastes.Half an order of fresh oysters were delicious, and a lobster roll too. Sadly we left no room for dessert, but we did see the dessert tray and it looked good enough to come back just for dessert. There are a lot of restaurants on the Pier. This is one you should not miss.', \"Visited Fog Harbor for the first time as my mother was visiting the city! Both of is are pretty serious seafood lovers and I have to say, Fog Harbor didn't disappoint!It was prime dinnertime around 6:30, but we had a reservation so seating wasn't an issue whatsoever. We got seated with a beautiful view of the water and got busy ordering!To start, we got the blue cheese garlic bread which was surprisingly good. I'm not usually a blue cheese person but I found these toasty and more importantly, yummy. I will say though it's a big portion, and it was definitely too much for just my mother and I, but that's a good thing! 7.5/10For mains, I ordered the Shellfish Platter which was this huge assortment of shellfish with a slice of toasted bread and warm garlic butter noodles beneath it all. Once again, it was a huge serving I barely finished and it was really good! It was a tad on the oily end, but I'd recommend it if you love all things shellfish! 8/10Lastly, my mother ordered the scallop and crab risotto and this was the star of the table. It was fluffy and full of flavor, the scallops were seared to perfection, and I couldn't help but keep stealing bites! 9/10Overall, Fog Harbor is a super solid seafood spot with good views, great food, and excellent service. Would highly recommend it if you love seafood!\", 'Amazing food and great service. Scallop and crab risotto is to die for. Our server Bong Jovi was super nice. Highly recommended!!!!', \"This is a must-visit for seafood lovers. Their Cioppino is packed with a variety of fresh seafood in a flavorful tomato broth. The Blue Cheese Garlic Bread is a delicious appetizer, and the Mussel Fries are a unique and tasty dish. Don't miss their Award Winning Clam Chowder served in a sourdough bread bowl. The Fish & Chips are crispy and satisfying. Overall, the food is delicious, the service is attentive, and the atmosphere is pleasant. Highly recommended.Ambiance - 5 StarsService - 5 StarsFood - 5 Stars\", \"I took family here while we were sightseeing in San Francisco.  I was excited seeing this is one of the top reviewed restaurants in Fisherman's Wharf and was able to get last minute reservations.  We arrived early but the hostess was able to seat us which was great because the restaurant was packed already and there were groups of people waiting to get in outside.  They guided us to our table, past the gorgeous floor to ceiling windows in front of the water and saw many people with full unobstructed views.  We were so disappointed to find out that they had a separate back room cramped with many small tables and situated in such a way that only half the guests had views of the window.  It doesn't seem fair however they decide which parties get to sit in the main dining room vs the back room.  The food was OK, the clam chowder is supposedly award winning but it was very average to me.  I had the mussel fries which needed much more broth and garlic aioli on top of the fries.  I guess if I ever came back I would make sure to call ahead and get a table in front of the windows so everyone can enjoy.\", 'When I see claims of \"the best\" or  \"world famous\", I can\\'t help but try out the thing to see if it is indeed, the best. Fog Harbor Fish House has been awarded the Best Seafood Restaurant in San Francisco and has award-winning Clam chowder. Being the best in San Fran is a bold claim, so I made it a point to stop here while exploring Pier 39. In case you\\'re ever looking for this place, know that it is on the second floor, so you need to go upstairs to get the front door. I made a reservation through Yelp a couple days in advance for a table for 1 for lunch. My reservation was honored and I was seated right away. The view from my table by the window was great; it overlooked the pier and I had a good time watching sea lions play and swim as further out tour ships arrived and left. On to the food. I ordered just one thing - a cup of clam chowder. There is an option to add crab meat, but I decided against it (hint: add the crab for a tastier soup). With no modifications, the clam chowder was pretty tasty. It was hot and I enjoyed eating it alongside the complementary bread and butter. Would it win my award for best chowder... the verdict is still out because it\\'s the first clam chowder I\\'ve ever had haha. I can say I would like more clam in the soup and that adding crab would have made a big difference. Seeing as I could have had another bowl... or two, I can concede that it\\'s a darn good clam chowder. If I hadn\\'t had a plane to catch, I would also try the Crab Cakes and the Seared Scallop & Crab Risotto. Next time!', \"We decided to have lunch at Fog Harbor Fish House. Upon arrival, we were seated within just 5 minutes. The restaurant's ambiance was delightful, even though it was crowded. Our server, Nick, was both friendly and helpful, guiding us in making our meal choices. We went with his recommendations and ordered the crab cakes, clam chowder, salmon, and shellfish platter. The food was great and worth the hype.\", \"This was genuinely one of the best meals I've ever had. I will definitely be back again whenever I'm in San Francisco again!Food:-Clam chowder: This was so good. It was nice and thick with a lot of clams. The seasoning was perfect and the mini sourdough roll was also delicious and paired perfectly with the clam chowder.-Scallop and crab risotto: I love risotto, and this was maybe the best risotto I've had. It looked pretty small from the photos, but it was actually a normal meal size portion. I ended up not being able to finish it all after eating the clam chowder too. The scallops were tender and seared well, and I was happy they weren't over cooked at all. The risotto was nice and buttery with a nice crab flavor. My favorite part of this dish was definitely the scallops. It was a bit on the salty side, but everything else about this dish was so good I still will give it a 5/5.Service and setting: The wait staff was so friendly and quick. I didn't have to wait too long for my food. The view was beautiful, especially the large windows the overlook the bay. You can see the sea lions and Alcatraz out the window.\"]\n",

      "Reviews: [\"A gem that delivers big on taste and heart.  The chefs / couple are clearly talented and very passionate about what they serve.  The deviled egg was a great starter.  The Chawanmushi steamed egg was one of my personal favorites, topped with their homemade XO sauce.  No surprise the ramen stole the show --  balanced and noodles were perfection.  It was inspiring hearing their story and I hope to be back soon to taste what's next.\", 'Came here in early August and made reservations via Tock that drop monthly. * financier with caviar - sweet, smoked shoyu. Like a sweet lox bagel bite. * Chawanmushi with XO sauce - shrimp was sweet. The egg is made with ramen tare for deep flavor. XO sauce was fun texture with the silky egg. Not your average chawanmushi. * Three eggs carbonara - carbo-nabura soba. Made with pasta flour. There was some konbu dashi. Garlic brown butter. Shoyu and shio tare. Shoyu made with oysters. Topped with a soy cured egg. * Tomato salad - peeled sun gold tomatoes. Fromage blanc cheese. Mala spicy sauce. Dashi gelee. Salad dressing made of vegetables. Shiso leaves on top. * 16 hour pork belly braised karaage - with marinated shiso leaves. * Yuzu daikon pickle* Cucumbers - made with salt sugar shio konbu. My favorite palette cleanser of the night. * Shio butter clam ramen - clam meat \"ice cream\". Hokkaido scallop. Konbu butter compound. 6 hour Pork neck collar chashu. As the butter melts, the broth changes from a clean clam broth to a creamy rich seafood broth. * yuzu shaved ice with golden kiwi preserve and almond jelly. With apricot seed extract. The shaved ice machine they use is from Japan and the texture is definitely different than the normal shaved ice. * Doraiyaki - white peach. Double brewed shoyu and mochi flower in the batter. Brown butter cookie crumble and white peach in the center. Delicious with great balance. The dining experience is very intimate and you get to learn a lot about how much thought and effort goes into their menu. For example, the noodles in their shio butter clam ramen being a collaboration with their noodle maker. They have a great sake selection and I would definitely try their sake pairing next time since the selection seemed like a lot that I haven\\'t seen before. This is my second time at Noodle in a Haystack and I\\'ll definitely be back!', 'The meals was just wonderful and mouthwatering. Every bite was umami filled. The chefs are as kind as they are skilled. Hope to have the opportunity to dine in their wonderful and intimate establishment soon!', 'Clearly, a lot of people love this place so  Im going to be the odd man out.  I totally get the passion here but for me, this was a huge let down.  Its a fixed menu with a couple appetizers and a the main course of ramen.  The apps were quite nice.  One dish was made of several small A5 pieces just lightly charred by torch.  The main was a dan dan style ramen.  It looked delicious.  Unfortunately it was so crazy spicy that I could not eat it.  It just burnt my mouth to such a degree that I could not taste anything.  After a few bites, I had to leave the rest.  Given that its a fixed menu there were no other options for me and I left quite hungry.  Very unfortunate especially the price point.  From reading other reviews they seem to change out dishes frequently.  Hopefully, when you go, you either like really spicy, or they have a different option for you.', \"Summary:So much more than just fancy ramenDetails:For the uninitiated, Noodle in a Haystack has been around for many years now, originally operating as a ramen-focused popup at various venues, with reservations that were largely impossible for most to get. Since those early days, the business has evolved significantly, with Clint and Yoko opening up their own brick and mortar space (after many a bureaucratic roadblock), reservations being marginally easier to get (you have a ~15 minute window now instead of ~30 seconds), and the menu having turned into something more akin to kaiseki (though still built around a star noodle dish, of course).I was lucky to nab a last minute opening during their soft launch month, and got to see and taste the fruits of their labor, as my girlfriend and I were treated to a bevy of courses: some, significantly more stellar than others, but all enjoyable in some form, and each presented with a bit of fanfare and background from the couple themselves. While the main noodle (a wagyu aburasoba the day we went) itself was obviously one of the star dishes, their caviar financier, kakuni karaage, and annin kakigori were also particularly outstanding.Absolutely worth a shot if you can snag a reservation. And while $225 after included tax and tip is certainly a steep price for ramen, it's more palatable if you think of it in terms of a tasting menu at a Michelin star restaurant, with the same expectation of care and quality put into the dishes.Accessibility:The space is a bit smaller and comprised of bar counter seating only, but they specifically designed a wheelchair accessible portion with a lower counter towards the far end!\", \"I was luckily able to go to one of the extended special 10 course dinners with sake pairings last Friday. What a fantastic meal! I loved every single dish and that isn't even an exaggeration. I continue to be amazed by how Clint and Yoko continue to hone their craft and create such impeccable dishes.The last time I visited, Clint mentioned they were thinking about changing up their first course after having it be the deviled egg for so many years. I was really excited to see what it was replaced with and the financier did not disappoint. What a perfect bite! The firefly squid with a little chili kick was such a good balance. I could not get enough of that uni/shrimp/monkfish liver/seaweed/rice cracker course, one of my faves. The homemade smoked chashu might be the best chashu I have ever had. The bf was so excited to see white asparagus (which reminded him of when he lived in Germany where it's more common), and he ate all of his scallops as well which is a sign of how good that particular dish was because I often get some of his scallop since he has a very mild allergy to them but when I peeked at his dish, they were already all gone haha. The wagyu katsu sando paired with the pickles was another one of my favorite dishes. Deciding to katsu the bread instead of the meat was really creative and worked super well. The crab ramen was great; really glad to be able to have it before crab season ends. The shaved ice and almond tofu was so refreshing after dinner and not too sweet (the best dessert compliment haha). The basque cheesecake with a light coffee flavor was also divine. Perfect meal from start to finish!Oh and all of the sakes were great as well. Nice variety and just the right quantity.\", \"I have been in love with Noodle in a Haystack and Clint & Yoko since 2016 and I am so happy I finally got to eat at their new restaurant. To be honest, I was unsure when the restaurant would open, but it was definitely worth the wait! The open faced chef's table-esque kitchen and modern/sleek design is extremely welcoming and the lighting is great for photos. I didn't tell Clint & Yoko this, but this was one of my first meals after recovering from food poisoning so I was unsure if I was going to even enjoy it, but oh boy, was this one of my favorite meals of the year. I can talk about all of the dishes in detail, but here are some of my favorites: +Japanese Avocado Toast - Mashed avocado with smoked trout on top of a deep fried donut hole. Finished with finger limes and a cold pressed African Green Chilli oil. This was magical... +Spanish blue fin toro tar tar tart - Toro on top of a tart? Got to love that ingenuity! Inspired by a sushi roll, they top it off with a regular pickle, smoked pickle, and shishito leaf. +Wagyu Abura Ramen - First of all, can we talk about the noodles they are using? Wagyu, wagyu butter, and those beautiful noodles. Come on! I mean come on! I am drooling just thinking about this. This was the star. I could have eaten a couple bowls of this. Also, Clint & Yoko are some of the nicest people I have ever met and it brings me so much joy to eat their food in such a beautiful space. For $150 a person, you get at least 7-8 courses and an intimate dining experience. They are rotating their menu and experimenting with local and seasonal ingredients so my experience will probably be different from the next person, but it is definitely worth trying out if you can snag a reservation!\", \"All dishes were fantastic! Best chawanmushi and ramen I've had by far! Atmosphere is also very nice, great music, intimate setting, courses came out promptly. The chefs and Pearl were so inviting, informative, and are very genuine people! My husband and I had a great time here and would definitely recommend!\", \"I had a phenomenal dining experience at Noodle in a Haystack! One glance at the name and you'd immediately think that it's just a ramen shop, but there are SO many layers here. It's an omakase and ramen shop with Asian fusion vibes and a monthly ramen style. They're constantly experimenting with new recipes, so the menu is always changing. The 8 courses ($125/person) were rich with flavor, umami, and creativity. While the star of the show was definitely the beautifully crafted and delicious ramen, the other food elements still lingered in my mind. My taste buds were dancing because I was transported back to my time in Japan.BONUS: Clint and Yoko are super sweet, kind, thoughtful, and knowledgeable! They initially ran their pop-up around the Bay Area, but the Kickstarter project helped bring their dream of opening a shop in SF to life. The current seating arrangement allows each guest to easily communicate with them. Clint explained each dish (and fun facts) with immaculate detail. They also have a special Pi-water filter!Note that this restaurant has no defined menu, so the items below might not be the same when you visit. However, there will probably be variations of these items. Either way, you won't be disappointed :) 1. Avocado toast with chili olive oil: Bite-sized bread with avocado. It looks really simple, but the acidity and flavor were very balanced.2. Rice crackers with uni and mix of fresh fish: The rice crackers brings me back to my childhood. The uni and fish were incredibly fresh and creamy. I need more of this in my life. 3. Kanpachi with ponzu sauce: Great ponzu sauce with a nice crunch from the onions!4. Chilled tofu: The sauce was inspired by tantanmen and mala, so you'll get a nice kick of umami. It was so smooth.5. 16-hour braised pork belly: WOW, the best pork belly that I've ever had. It literally MELTED in my mouth. Smooth like butter *cues BTS song* :) This gave me KBBQ vibes because of the meat + salad combo.6. Radish and pickled vegetables (shared between 2 people): So refreshing and tasty! I'd love to have this on the side at all times.7. Abura soba ramen: THE best ramen I've ever had and on the same wavelength as the best ramen places in Japan. This gave me Mi Goreng vibes, but amplified x1000. The onions were sweet and mild without the spicy onion flavor. Their wagyu butter and wagyu fat mousse in the sauce were divine. Soak the noodles with the orange egg yolk for some extra creamy flavor. It was SO FREAKING DELICIOUS.8. Almond jello with kiwi and shaved ice: Great way to end the night with super light dessert!\", \"We started trying to get reservations for this place in 2019 and finally got them in 2020, but unfortunately with the pandemic it got pushed several times. After 2 whole years we were finally able to reschedule for their kickstarter and it was well worth the long wait. This restaurant is super intimate with just 8-12 seating and there's only 3 staff members including Yoko and Clint. Throughout our dinner, we were able to hear about their journey in opening their new space and unfortunately, they're actually not allowed to have a full kitchen setup due to permit issues. We saw them using portable burners to cook the ramen and a toaster oven to heat up their proteins. However, with that said, it's still amazing what they can create even with limited resources available. We got our reservations with the Wagyu Abura Soba and our meal consisted of  7 courses. It included appetizers, small dishes/palette cleansers, ramen, and dessert. Each course was delicious in their own ways and it was actually more food than I anticipated. I was stuffed by the end of the meal and I ended up giving some of my ramen to my bf to finish because I wanted to save room for dessert. It's definitely hard to get reservations here, but definitely keep trying because it's so worth it. For the quality of their craft and ingredients, I agree with another yelper and can foresee them getting a Michelin Star somewhere in the future. Hoping they will reopen their reservations again soon so we can come back!\", \"I originally had reservations for this pre-pandemic pop-up celebrating home-made Japanese noodles for March 13, 2020. In the two-and-a-half years since my aborted reservation, the restaurant found a brick-and-mortar location and appears to have developed a singular vision of how to elevate a college-food staple to fine dining extravagance.Every ingredient is steamed, frozen, puréed, broiled, grilled, whatever, all in an effort to stun the palate. Even sesame seeds and lettuce are intentional choices to highlight the husband-and-wife chefs' creativity.It's still a soft opening, and the regular kinks of post-pandemic dining out persist, but this is a restaurant doing something no one else is doing and doing it impressively.\", 'Truly an amazing and unique meal! Clint and Yoko have really innovated on a set cuisine around ramen and taken their passion and dedication to a whole new level. I was blown away with their thoughtfulness and hearing about the history of how their dishes came to be through multiple iterations, discovery and adjustments - whimsical but also very purposeful in trying to achieve the best outcome possible. They are both so engaging, down to earth and welcoming. We will be back for sure to see what they come up with next season!クリントとようこさんごち様でした！本当にありがとございました^_^', \"To tell you about this place, I literally never heard of them before I saw them on the social media and really interested to try out their ramen since I'm a ramen lover. But they have just opened the shop just a few months ago and before that they were just doing pop-up. So I tried to find a way to get a reservation and you could make it on Tock. I was on the waitlist and luckily, I got a seats. So let's talk about the restaurant and food now.The restaurant has no sign and it's really new. Clean looks and only table seating. I got there early and got to seated first. Nice counter bar. We got the beverage menu and order the sake pairing.First : the devils egg with crispy chicken skins and salmon roe Second : tofu with tomato like caprese saladThird : sashimi Hawaiian amberjackFourth : tofu crab with Uni Fifth : deep fried pork belly saladSixth : housemade ramen noodle Seventh : shaved ice Overall: food was good but only little things that could be improved such as the temperature and the fat of the beef was chewy. Service was very friendly but with the price of 125$ that you could also go enjoy at some Michelin star. Still need to step up a little bit. Looking forward to come back again though when they change the menu.\", \"So happy to be able to support Noodle in a Haystack from day 1. Clint and Yoko are the only people bringing Michelin quality ramen to San Francisco and everyone needs to know about it. You can tell each dish is crafted with so much care and thought. From the first course ramen egg (a standard dish from pop-up days) to the star abura soba/ramen with custom noodles to the last shaved yuzu ice/kiwi almond pudding (amazing iteration of the shaved yuzu ice!). Run, don't walk, or you'll miss your chance!\", 'Finally found time to have our kickstarter meal. Such a great experience and nice to see Clint and Yoko in their new modern space.Pork belly and ramen were the standouts but every course was meticulous and wonderful. Thanks guys for a wonderful experience and look forward to coming back soon.', \"I first met Clint and Yoko years ago when they were hosting Noodle in a Haystack as a pop-up in their home and I have been a big fan ever since. So naturally, I was so excited for them when they decided to open a ramen-focused restaurant and happily backed their Kickstarter! The intimate dining experience was excellent. Clint and Yoko are a seamless team, effortlessly engaging with their guests while at the same time assembling each dish right before your eyes.  All of the dishes in their pre fixe menu have a ramen theme, whether through creative uses of ingredients or fun injections of familiar ramen flavors. We ordered a nice bottle of sake, which paired perfectly with the meal. The space has an elegant minimalistic vibe, which only makes the food and plating stand out even more! The whole dining experience was just so fun! I can't wait to see how the menu changes over time and can't wait to come back!\", 'Delicious and great conversation! Loved all the dishes and especially the ones photoed. Meal is timed well.', \"It was yummy and some dishes were creative, but really not worth the price nor hype in my opinion. For $150 pp I would expect to be blown away. Their chili oil wasn't even homemade. I've had a 10 course kaiseki at that price in comparison. They're good people, I wish them all the success in perfecting their craft. Try it for yourself! But maybe just the one time.\", \"Noodleina Haystack, the main ramen concept restaurantIt's not just ramen, it's the Omakase menu.It's gorgeous!!! Every dish is delicious!a drop of soupThere's no juice left!The restaurant is run by a married couple. The male chef used to cook ramen in Japan.First place in the race.

If you can book a spot and enjoy, the hard work they pull into each dish shows even the dinner ware they source. Food for each menu varies so it's hard for me to tell you what to expect,the one only thing I can say is delicious and come with a open mind\"]\n",

Generous portion size for the price.Sense a pattern?We loved the food, and in an era of \"shrinkflation\" they have kept prices fair, food quality high, and portion sizes great. To me that is absolutely worthy of 5 stars.', \"California comfort cuisine done right could be the mantra of Starbelly. Located near the bustling intersection of 16th and Market Streets in the Castro neighborhood of San Francisco, Starbelly is the epitome of a neighborhood gem where locals congregate for their signature brunches on their highly regarded backyard patio, and people from out of town are familiar with their homespun yet still elevated takes on classic comfort food. I had been to Starbelly once before, as an invited guest of a special event that they were hosting showcasing the aforementioned back patio, now over a full decade later I was back mainly due to the fact that Starbelly was participating in San Francisco Restaurant Week in which local restaurants offer diners a prefix meal of three courses sold at an affordable price. This way, diners, both locals and out-of-towners can experience a popular restaurant without breaking the bank, and support a local establishment; making it a win-win for everyone! From my recollections, Starbelly has not participated in San Francisco Restaurant Week in quite some time, so when I saw that they were taking part in it this year, I jumped at the chance to entertain a group of diners and I one weeknight evening.Reservations were super easy to make via the Yelp app, and when I finally arrived, they were packed with customers, which only reiterated how popular they are with locals. Although their back patio is well regarded at Starbelly, being sat right next to the entrance at night with the cold air rushing through the open door wasn't the most ideal of situations. The menu at Starbelly is separated into sections including Snacks, Salads, Small (or Appetizers), Sides, Pizza, and Plates (or Entrées). Of course, we came for restaurant week and it provided all of these menu items sold at a more affordable price point as we were already dining on three courses. For my appetizer course, I ordered their Pumpkin Dumplings, which were served with brown butter, sage, pumpkin seeds and shaved garan. Others in my party ordered their Mix Chicories Salad which was topped with persimmon, pomegranate, pumpkin seeds and goat feta; and their House Made Chicken Liver Pâté, which was served with buttered bread, sweet onion marmalade and grain mustard. To start our meal, we shared their House Cut Fries which were served with three dips.For our entrées, I ordered their Grilled Bavette Steak, which was served with crispy plantains, nopales, and an heirloom tomato salad topped with a spicy peanut salsa matcha. Others in my party ordered their Sumac Seared Hawaiian Tombo Tuna, which was served with a white butter bean puree, grilled little gems and topped with a green olive salsa. For our dessert course, I ordered their Warm Toffee Cake which was served with a dollop of mascarpone and medjool dates. Others ordered their Salted Caramel Pot de Crème, which was served with cornmeal-rosemary cookies; and their Arborio Rice Pudding, which was served with brandy soaked cherries. Our food did take a while to come out, as it was very busy. The highlights were definitely the appetizer courses, as the Pumpkin Dumplings and Liver Pâté were not only excellently plated, but they were each lovingly crafted and we each could have had that dish as a main course and be satisfied. I really liked the spicy kick that my Bavette Steak had, but the Tombo Tuna was served a little too lukewarm for my fellow diners taste. The Toffee Cake was super sweet, and the rice pudding wasn't what my fellow diners expected it would taste like, so take that for what it's worth. Of particular note, they were gracious enough to take our Fries off of our final bill when we commented that they were all remnant pieces of potato, and not what we were expecting. The total bill for five diners was $256.62, after tax, but before gratuity was added in, which was reasonable, considering how many courses of food we enjoyed this evening. With the perfect meal for our large group, Starbelly has definitely become a local institution where diners can enjoy the comforts of home in an welcoming setting, and I for one am so glad they have thrived in the Castro neighborhood for so many years!\", 'The host, who is the first face you interact with, seemed to be very stressed. This made her seem unapproachable and she was a little rude when she finally engaged us. Other than that, the rest of the staff were great. This is a MICHELIN  restaurant. The corn pizza sounded delicious only on paper. Mehhhh! My favorite thing that I ate here was actually the LOCO MOCO! Highly recommend! Try to get reservations. This restaurant gets really busy and wait times can take a while. Luckily, we were able to be seated without any reservations. The outdoor patio was nice. The indoor seating looked a little crowded.', \"Starbelly in San Francisco's Castro neighborhood is a true gastronomic delight, meriting every one of its five stars. This charming spot combines a relaxed, inviting atmosphere with a culinary prowess that is hard to match. Their farm-to-table approach is evident in every dish, showcasing fresh, locally-sourced ingredients that burst with flavor. The standout for me was their house-made pizza, boasting a perfectly crisp crust and innovative toppings that were a harmonious blend of savory and fresh. Accompanied by their unique cocktail selections and attentive, friendly service, Starbelly creates an experience that is both delightfully sophisticated and comfortably casual. A must-visit for anyone looking for an exceptional dining experience in the Castro!\", \"Cute back patio space for groups looking for a light bites/tapas style dinner with crafty cocktails!Came through with some friends for dinner and drinks on a weekday. We made easy reservations via Yelp and didn't have to wait. Give yourself extra time to find parking if you're driving, as Starbelly is located in a 5-way intersection. We all got confused on which direction to walk. Surprisingly, we didn't have to wait and we didn't see anyone else in line when we rolled up. They're dog-friendly in their back patio, and it's not extremely spacious but can fit a few groups. No outdoor heaters, but it stayed pretty warm despite the cool and slightly windy weather.We went ham on ordering the dishes, started with their fries with 3 dip sampler, burrata with grilled peaches (such a summery delight!), thai basil sausage, crab burrata dumplings (#1 pick, but so sad it was over in one bite), grilled steak with peanut matcha dressing (holy smokes, this was the most special and definitely a favorite with the sweetness of plantains and grilled onions) and roasted corn cilantro pizza. The drinks were FIRE, and so well presented...check da photos. Food was def on point! Wish we could eat this good and with this much variation all the time.Be prepared to pay a pretty penny, definitely on the $$$'s list, and portion sizes aren't big at all. I would say their evening menu is more a tapas style vs big entree vibe. Regardless, we had such a fun night with great convo, professional service, and constant water-refills without having to flag our server down. Noise was a bit louder when all of the tables were full, as the patio tables are close together. But a quick peek indoors looked more romantic/chill with the dim lighting.The food runners were so great, smiley, and honestly way more involved with our table compared to our server. Shoutout to the guy who went the extra mile to get my pup a bowl of water! It means a lot. Starbelly is a great spot for groups and for diverse eaters who want to share and tapas it out.\", \"Consistently delicious and packed on a Tuesday night!We sat on high chairs and the tables wobble,  so the kind waiter helped make them stable.  There's also outdoor seating with heat lamps and more space in the back indoor patio.We had hummus and pita, corn pizza, mussels in tasty red sauce, Babette steak, Starbelly salad, gazpacho and ceviche.  I had a Passionflower drink.  My daughter had her favorite lavender lemonade.   Warm toffee cake and caramel pot de crème were delightful desserts to finish our meals.  Great location, good vibes, Lively SF crowd with friendly and professional service.  What more could I want?\", 'Really cute vibe great for a date spot! Have an awesome back patio with twinkly lights.Really good happy hour, the waitstaff was super friendly.Definitely would come back here dinner next time!', 'Got to know about this place because my partner got a gift card for Starbelly. We chose to be seated at the back patio- it looked amazing. Has a few vegetarian options , I got the mushroom pizza which was good. Lot of cocktail options, we got 3 , they tasted good but watered down. Overall happy with the service .', \"Always a good time here! Family friendly, good food.RESERVATIONSMade online about a month in advance for a group of 8, inadvertently for pride weekend but that ended up being fun! PARKINGEven during pride weekend, both groups were able to find parking after 5-10 minutes of circling, north of Market, within a few blocks.THE SERVICEFine, helpful and attentive, even for how busy it was there!THE COST$95 total including tax/tip for a family of four: 2 drinks, 3 entrees.THE DRINKS* Ruby Skye ($12) - 4 stars. Really good, refreshing, citrusy.* Chumbo Picante ($14) - 3.5 stars. Tasty, love the egg white texture, but a little strong for me (granted I'm a lightweight).THE FOOD* Loco Moco ($16) - 4 stars. I enjoyed the flavors; I haven't seen many loco mocos on menus in SF!* Fried Chicken Po Boy ($14) - 4 stars. Meat was moist but bread was weakest link, soft & fell apart easily.* Margherita Pizza ($15) - 3.5 stars. Our table ordered two of these and we noticed a big inconsistency in the quality. The one I photographed was by far the better of the two, crust crisped just right. The second one we got was much more burnt and overly toasted, cheese overcooked.\", 'Came for happy hour with a friend and it was still easy to get seats before 6pm. We got happy hour fries and the corn pizza which is a must try! I love the ambiance - from the entrance to the patio. Although...they were trying to rush us out (asked to clear our plates 4-5x) after we had been there for an hour - I guess it was getting more packed, but we were still munching on our fries!', \"I've been to Starbelly a handful of times, and each time, I walk away with a happy belly. The Mussels with chorizo are simply delicious, and I'm officially addicted.I've received good service, even when the restaurant is busy, so I'm giving them high marks for that.\", \"Got a round of cocktails and some pizzas. Where pretty decent. The corn pizza especially was nice. The other pizza we got was a bit floppy and the toppings didn't really hold on. The apps were quite good though! The liver pâté was sublime.\", 'We had a splendid time there. Everyone thought the space was very cute and intimate and it was a perfect size for our office party. We booked the back patio for our holiday party. The food was delicious and plentiful. Everyone was raving about the quality of the food - we even had leftover pizzas to take home! The pacing of the food being brought out was perfect. Everything was timed very well. They allowed us to do our white elephant gift exchange and were pretty accommodating of us being a little bit rowdy and also ending a little bit over the time limit. Overall 5/5', \"Starbelly, located in San Francisco's Castro neighborhood, is a culinary gem deserving of its five stars. This inviting spot showcases an impressive culinary skillset and a commitment to using fresh, locally-sourced ingredients. Their homemade pizza, with a crispy crust and innovative toppings, stood out as a perfect balance of flavors. The exceptional cocktail selections and friendly service elevate the dining experience at Starbelly. For an exceptional dining experience in the Castro, don't miss out on Starbelly!\", \"I have only good things to say about this place!The menu has traditional American dishes like pizzas and burgers, and they also offer a great selection of cocktails to accompany your meal. We started with some appetizers - the first we got was the chicken liver pate, which came with bread and 3 delicious spreads. At some point we ran out of bread and still had leftover spreads, and they were kind enough to just give us extra bread without any charge. They really figured their pizzas out! We got the margherita pizza as well as the star belly bacon pizza, and they were both fantastic choices. What really sold me was the crust, it was just the right thickness and crunch - it may just be my own personal preference - and honestly this was some of the best pizza I've had in SF which I was not expecting at all. The star belly bacon pizza was really good - I thought I would take issue with the amount of arugula they put on top of the pizza but it ended up being the perfect amount! The cocktails are also great and the menu offers a wide variety. We were seated in this kind of outdoor area which had excellent natural lighting and great greenery/decor. Even though the place was kind of full, we were able to get all of our dishes pretty quickly which is a huge plus. Especially with the drinks it was no more than a 5 minute wait from ordering to having the drink in my hand. Their regular entrees are probably really good, but if you are going with a group I would recommend going with the pizzas because of the taste and the low cost (though everything on the menu was pretty reasonably priced).\", \"Lovely brunch in Castro. Food: 4 Service: 3 Atmosphere: 5Cost to worth it rating: 4 (entrees $12-16 and large)Opentableable: no but Yelp Return worthiness: yesHighlights:- Outdoor patio out back: nice covered space with a fun vibe - Chilaquiles: big pile of red sauced chips with homemade chorizo that wasn't greasy or too spicy. Bonus for the entire half of avocado and side salad. 4.5 stars- Chicken and waffle: 2 waffles and large fried chicken pieces stacked. Very tasty. 4 stars - Fun drinks: not just standards. I got a strawberry infused vodka spritz and a lychee prosecco one.- Cornbread: good form texture, slightly sweet, and grilled on the edges. Only nit is it said jalapeño cornbread and didn't have jalapeños in it like I had seen pictured. 4 stars - Water: give you a large wine bottle full so you can keep hydrated.- Seating options: also indoor table, high tops by the bar, and parklet outside.Lowlights:- Busy so hard to get the attention of our waitress when needed. - Yelp reservation: love that you can reserve for brunch, but didn't have an indication of where to be seated, but when we got there it said parklet. That would've been ok but it was so windy and was excited they had space out back. Fully enjoyed our delicious and fun brunch here and would be happy ti return.\", \"It's been a while since I've last visited Starbelly and so I decided to stop by during restaurant week for their amazing $15 lunch deal! Turns out however that the deal was only for M-F, but we figured we'd give the brunch menu a try since we were already here. The menu is rather small but has a good variety of items including egg dishes, pizzas, fried chicken sandwich, etc. There was also a drinks list with some tasty sounding cocktails that were pretty affordable compared to other spots, though we did not try any this time. We ended up trying the asparagus pizza, asparagus and spring onion soup, and fries. The pizza was definitely large enough to feed two people with moderate appetites and I liked the more subtle flavors paired with the salty meat. My favorite part was the crust which was thin and crispy! Only gripe would be the amount of oil, there were a few times when the oil would spill into my hand while eating it - with that said, the oil did add good flavor. The soup was nice and creamy without being too heavy - I liked that it wasn't overly salted and really let the asparagus shine. The fries could have been a bit more crisp for my liking - they're reminiscent of in-n-out fries. Service was prompt and friendly and I love the beautiful space here - the patio is also dog friendly!!\", \"I've eaten here several times and the food is consistently good. The service isn't as attentive as expected.\", \"We came by for brunch the other day and were shocked by how good their seasonal dishes were for spring. It's asparagus and scallion season, and Starbelly really delivered in our last visit. Normally, I would not be super thrilled for an Asparagus and Spring Onion Soup, but it was so flavorful and highlighted the ingredients perfectly. If my picky childhood self had tried this growing up, I would've come to love asparagus much sooner.We also ordered the Asparagus Pizza, which was refreshing and decadent at the same time. The green sauce (which I'm guessing is a pesto made with asparagus?) added a fresh element that was balanced well with the cheese and prosciutto toppings. But if it's not decadent enough, I recommend trying the House Cut Fries, which somehow taste and look like In-N-Out fries. Unsure if they're making it the exact same way or what magic they're working, but the fries are also amazing.Lastly, we really appreciated how accommodating and kind they were for our dog! We'll be back again to try their next seasonal menu.\", 'Starbelly was an ideal spot for a cocktail lunch amidst a day of errands. The relaxed ambiance and welcoming staff provided a nice break for the hustle, and their diverse cocktail selection added a delightful touch to the meal. The food options were equally impressive, offering a flavorful range that catered to various tastes. The convenience of its location on Market made it a standout choice for a satisfying and enjoyable midday pause.']\n",

      "Reviews: ['Make a reservation before you attempt to come here. I live in the neighborhood and tried without one unsuccessfully. The hostess quoted us \"15min\" for a party of two to be seated, but we waited there for almost 45m before giving up.', \"The food, sake, and service were exceptional. I can't wait to come back and try more dishes. The salmon curry was unique and delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly.\", \"This place is such a hidden gem!  I've been here few times and was satisfied every time i went.  The place itself is simple and casual with a touch of elegance.  It was very cozy and perfect for friends gathering or even a date night.  Service was welcoming from start to finish.  They know their menu pretty well and gave good recommendations.  Food was outstanding with its unique flavors.  I felt it is a combination of Korean Thai fusion.Here's what we ordered, and the portions are pretty bigKimchi rice balls (4/5)Recommend* A perfect appetizer to share.  Crispy outside with kimchi flavored rice inside and topped a special sauce that made everything work.Tom Yum Noodle Soup (5/5)A bit spicy but the soup itself was very rich.  Highlight of the soup is actually the crispy pork inside.  Very delicious overall.Korean Spicy Noodle (5/5)If you like Korean style cold noodle, this is the dish you can't go wrong with. It was sweat and sour with a little bit spice.  Very refreshing. Bibimbap (3/5)This dish was ok, a bit blend. I would recommend making a reservation just in case.\", \"Glad I got to try this place but I won't be back. I made reservations for 6:30 and got here a few minutes early. Parking was not the greatest but that was expected. We parked 3 blocks away.The restaurant was pretty empty upon arrival and stayed that way until the end of the meal. Together we ordered:Hamachi Kama 3/5: standard. I really liked the sauce that it came with. Thai braised chicken: 2/5 nothing special. Had a side of wonton noodles in a sauce that I didn't not enjoy. Cold spicy noodles with pork jowl: 2/5 flavors were great a few bites in but I was really struggling to finish it.\", \"Kothai, the Korean and Thai fusion gem, not only impressed with its unique and delicious dishes but also stands out for providing one of the best service experiences I've encountered. The waiter went above and beyond by keeping us updated on wait times, setting the tone for a positive dining experience.The menu at Kothai showcases creativity with unique and flavorful dishes. The creative appetizers add an exciting dimension to the meal, and personally, the noodle dishes became a clear favorite.Adding to the overall appeal, the environment at Kothai is super aesthetic, making it an excellent choice for a great date spot. The thoughtful combination of delightful dishes, exceptional service, and a visually appealing setting makes Kothai a standout fusion restaurant.In summary, Kothai is a must-visit for those seeking a fusion of Korean and Thai flavors. With top-notch service, creative dishes, and a charming environment, it creates an ideal setting for a memorable dining experience.\", \"New, Korean Thai fusion restaurant that lives up to its name. Wasn't too busy and the restaurant was kind of quiet on a Sunday 2pm lunch time. Service was quick to seat and refill water.5/5 Crispy Grilled Hamachi Collar was super fresh and came with a crunchy green chili basil crumb underneath that pairs well with the white, less seasoned parts of the fish. The dish would've been perfect with a scoop of white rice to soak up the crispy , not too oily bits of fish skin. 4/5 Thai Braised Chicken was solid, the meat was juicy and tender to fork off the bone. I liked how it came with mushroom but was surprised the sauce to pour over it wasn't salty or as umami.Luckily, I asked for their condiment rack and the green chili vingarette sauce was the perfect combo with the chicken. The spice one was alright, both were freshly made in house.Would come back with a larger group to try different items!\", \"Delicious, spicy flavors exploding in your mouth! The Tom yum noodle wasn't too spicy but still had a Thai kick and lemongrass flavor. I'd definitely order the Tom yum again and the mushroom, bean sprout, egg, and not over cooked king shrimps (2) were delish. We mostly tried the Thai side of the menu,but it is a Thai Korean fusion place. The mushroom plate had a unique flavor dip and crunch with the leaves which had an acid taste too. The chocolate mousse was rich but not heavy. The berry compote was a nice addition to it too. We also enjoyed the crudo with smoked flavor and squid texture plus mango sauce with a kick. Also amazing. The vibe: clean, modern look on the corner of Judah and 9th. Clear glass windows and inside heaters with pretty wreaths. Hope it stays here for a while and will be in our rotation of places to come again to. We walked in at 7pm on a Saturday night and there was no wait. There was a table or two open !\", \"20/10! So thankful I stumbled across this TikTok video to try Kothai. I was a bit skeptical to try since Bangsang (another Korean fusion restaurant) was super disappointing but I cannot say enough great things about this place! Besides the food being absolutely amazing, the service was what stood out the most. Every single person in there was so sweet, attentive, and food came out pretty quick!We had the Hamachi Kama, Kalbi, Iron steak, Ceviche, and both noodle soups. The ceviche, Kalbi, and Tom yum noodle soup is a MUST TRY! I'd love to come back\", \"Sep 2023Solid. New place to try at the end of the trip. The decor is nice and simple, and the curtains were lowered so the sun didn't beat down on us. The service was friendly, and helpful with any questions we had. Check ins and water refills were frequent.We had gotten the kimchi rice balls to split. Compatriots ordered the Tom Yum and the Beef noodle soup. I got the bibimbap vegan with egg. The flavor fusions worked well flavorwise. The broths for both soups were rich and the balance of ingredients worked well. The Kimchi rice balls were a good opener with the sauce bringing a nice richness to it. I didn't lick the plate but I was close. The bibimbap was plated very well and presentation was really nice. The sauce brought things together tho it was a bit fresh for me. I'd want a bit of salt even without the sauce, and something savory to tie it.All in all definitely a good stop. I'd be interested to try other things on the menu next time.\", \"I came here with a group of friends before Outside Lands, as we wanted to get some food at a Thai place that was not too far from it. While the inside isn't the largest, we were able to get a table to seat the party of 10 or so that we had. The service was good and while our food did take some time, I think that's mainly due to the larger size of our party. I ordered the Tomyum noodle soup and the kimchi rice balls. The portion size for the noodle soup is substantial, and I think for the price it's pretty worth. The flavors were good for the tomyum and the meat inside it were also cooked well. The Kimchi rice balls were pretty interesting, as the outside was quite crispy with the kimchi stuffed within. I think this is worth getting as an appetizer, and it's a good one to share with a couple others! Overall, it's a nice restaurant and would recommend trying it out!\", \"Celebrated a friend's birthday and we decided to share everything family style.Bibimbap 7/10 pretty good but no wow factor! Def a fusion take though because of the carrots and coleslaw but taste wise wasn't too bad! We didn't try it with the peanut sauce so not sure if that would have been better or notSpicy cold noodles: 6/10 personally a little spicy for me! I also think that the pork jowl sauce didn't pair too well with the spicy noodles and the fact that the meat was warm while the noodles were cold was throwing me off a bit. But they were good if you ate them separately! I started eating the pork jowl with the veggies from the galbi dish instead and it was really good (also dipped it with ssamjang and the aioli sauce from the fried rice balls, bomb)Kimchi Fried rice balls: 9/10 i was pleasantly surprised!! It looks unassuming but it was actually pretty yummy and the aioli sauce was so good. It was the underdog of the night I recommend trying it. Galbi: 10/10 the meat was so tender, perfectly cooked, and was so enjoyable to eat wrapped in the veggies provided. A solid dish and a must get if you are sharing with your table. We shared among 6 people, but 4/6 were not so hungry. Portion size for the bibimbap would probably be like 2-3, the galbi is probably good for like 4 people to share. Ambience was nice and staff were all super friendly and on top of filling our waters!\", 'Service: 5Presentation: 5Ambiance: 5Noise level: 5Flavors: 5+Prices: 4 (but in all honesty everything is expensive nowadays)', \"Made a reservation with a small group and got seated immediately. Most people in my group don't eat spicy so they made sure to lower the spice level to mild for all our entrees. Ordered: Kimchi Rice BallsBossam Tom Yum Beef Noodle SoupLoved the bossam and kimchi rice balls. Of the two noodle soups, I would choose the Tom Yum over the Beef Noodle. The beef noodle had a very medicinal broth which we were not expecting. The menu isn't too extensive so if you're looking for a lot of options this might not be the restaurant for you.\", \"O V E R A L LMy friend introduced me to this restaurant and I immediately brought it back to my family/friends and I returned less than a month of my first visit. This place is such a hidden gem... I was so happy to have discovered this before it blew up. However, this place deserves all the business and hype!! I probably tried all the items on their menu at the time at this point.O R D E R(This is a late review so prices are older)Korean Spicy Noodle ($21) --- 10/5 Don't even think about it, just order it. I had this same dish twice and enjoyed this with 4 different people and everyone said this was part of their top fav orders. Kimchi Rice Balls 2 ($12) --- 4/5 This was really good but I think a bit more simple --- but done well. The sauce was amazing though! Tom Yum ($23) --- 5/5 Loved it!! It is a different take on it but it was still incredible.Beef Noodle Soup ($22) --- 4/5 This didn't taste like Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup, but it was a different take of it... still very good!Korean BBQ Skirt ($28) --- 4/5 This is where I give bonus points to the chef -- he came out and said he realized the first fix was not enough (not 8oz as listed -- and we noticed that as well)... and offered us a lot more to make up for it. Thank you for being so attentive in fixing this without us asking for it! Bibimbap ($22) --- I wasn't the one who ordered this because I normally don't go for Bibimbap, but I was told this was really good!Grilled Hamachi Collar ($20) --- 5/5 I ordered this in my first visit - not pictured here... and it was so bomb!!! This literally melted in my mouth and the pairing with the broccolini was just.... Amazing.S E R V I C EAs I mentioned prior, props to Chef for coming out and fixing a mistake without us mentioning it. O T H E RParking here is A PAIN. Absolute pain both times. Plan ahead...

I heard great things about this restaurant so I was really excited. The service here was excellent as they change out your plate and silverware  after every dish. The menu was really small l, but there was some interesting dishes that I wanted to try.Kimchi Rice Balls (5/5): This dish is a kimchi fried rice ball that is deep fried. It comes with bacon inside and layer on a bed of aioli. The dish was fried to perfection and balanced well with its crunchiness and the softness of the kimchi fried rice. It was a bit spicy, but not too spicy. I thought the aioli was kewpie mayo and tasted very similar, but I enjoyed the very generous amount of it.Korean Spicy Noodle (5/5): This was my favorite dish of the night. This cold noodle dish is refreshing and a bit spicy at the same time. We got the pork jowl option and there was a generous amount of pieces. The pork jowl just melted in your mouth like heaven.Tom yum soup (5/5):  Beware, this dish is spicy. This Thai staple was filled it ingredients like crispy pork belly, mushrooms, a soft-boiled egg, and noodles. The broth was very spicy and sweet. I really like the add-ons, especially the crispy pork belly.I really enjoyed my experience here and had one of the best dinners I've had in a while.\", 'Ordered 3 entree dishes. The beef soup was amazing. Also ordered the roasted chicken, chicken was amazing, I think the dish could have used more noodles tbh. The last dish was the king salmon, the chef cooks it medium rare which was good but neither of us were into the curry so much....nice place nice service', 'Korean thai fusion place. Came on a Sunday upon opening and they were not busy at all. Servers were attentive and fast with giving us our orders.Everything we ordered was so delicious. Appetizers include the chicken toast and crying tiger skirt steak - which was like a lettuce wrap. I also loved their tom yum, but my other friends who tried it claimed that it was too \"shrimpy.\" - just fyi for those not a big fan of a seafood taste.Thai braised chicken was delicious too!Loved the glass walls that gave the restaurant a vibrant look!!', \"Fusion food is great in SF, where diversity reigns and cultures blend.  However, it takes high concept to make it work.  This place seems to have put a lot of thought into their menu and cozy restaurant.  KoThai Republic is a spicy combination of Korean and Thai foods along with sake and other alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks.  We had Kimchi Rice balls - crunchy, flavorful and slathered with mayo; KoThai Ceviche is a burst of lime, shrimp, peppers on crispy lettuce leaves - this IS spicy!  The salmon yellow Thai curry with rice made me sweat.  Glad we had the Apple crumble cheesecake dessert, because it tamed the heat on our tongues when drinking water didn't soothe us enough.  Friendly, attentive, professional service.  With an open kitchen, we can see the chefs making their masterpieces.  Highly recommended - especially for those who want to wake up their palettes!\", 'The service was great. However, the food left me yearning for something that is more fusion-y and creative. The cabbage wrapping around salmon and got served with green curry was interesting.

Luckily, the restaurant was not busy yet, and we were sat soon after. The menu features a variety of asian fusion dishes, focusing on Korean, Thai, and a bit of Chinese. We ordered chicken toast (4/5) and korean spicy noodles (4/5). The server was super attentive, always filling up our water. The ambient is also super adorable and modern - definitely pass the date vibe!']\n",

I am not a vegetarian (full disclosure), and the food is over the top good. The soups are delicious, and all the dishes are flavorful, fresh and very unique. Easy to check the 5 star rating.', \"Had to be over near UCSF Parnassus around lunch and Savor popped up in the search.  Actually found parking in 1 minute (this was the first good sign).  Seated in a moment, with paper menus and friendly server.He talked us into the artichoke soup (let him talk you into it too!)--and then, falafel and the mushroom sandwich.  Portions felt large and filling; the taste was amazing.Artichoke soup was savory, flavorful; I asked the chef, he said it's not roasted, but it tastes like a real Maillard reaction has happened somewhere because there's a depth to it that it's difficult to explain otherwise.  Smooth and so very clean (and delivered warm/hot to the table).The falafel was served in an aluminum blanket; excellent accompaniments, with cucumbers, enough but not too much onion, etc etc etc.  The star of the show, the falafels, were essentially perfect; crispy outsides but not oily--and fresh and savory interiors.

There was a very small staff of 2 people and indoor and outdoor seating. Everyone was very friendly to us and helpful. All of the food was filling and tasty. My favorite was the vegan poke. My friend enjoyed many of the mushroom tapas. The dessert pictured was phenomenal.Definitely give this place a try if you love Mediterranean cuisine!\", 'My first visit was accidental! My nearby friend was busy so I tried to find a nice place to take my lunch break and happened to notice that Martha Bros Coffee was now something else. I sauntered in and got a little nervous that all of the menu items seemed to be vegetarian. And I didn\\'t want to be rude and leave.So I ordered an avocado toast which sounded pretty safe and basic. The owner surprised me by asking if I wanted the sunny-side-up-egg add-on, because otherwise \"it\\'s a pretty boring dish.\" Lol! :)  He then suggested I try the Green Spanish Melt instead, which I did, with the soup of the day.It was absolutely amazing. I can\\'t even describe how the flavors of the ingredients were speaking to me, and paired with the soup, easily became the most memorable meal I\\'ve had in a long time.So I came back for dinner on another night.I tried the Savor Platter and the Mashi (eggplant). First off, the pita bread that accompanied the platter was so warm and delicious! The falafel was unlike any other I\\'ve had, the inside was tender and green and fluffy and perfect. And NOT OILY! I can\\'t believe a falafel could be better than the ones at Sunrise Deli but these are. I enjoyed all of the dips: the hummus, baba ganoush, eggplant, and a green one that I think is avocado-based (tasted amazing).The mashi was baked to a perfect tenderness and the sauces that adorned it were addictively savory and delicious.I also took a spinach-based stew and their lemon raspberry tart to-go for my family, very much enjoyed!!I plan to bring friends here, including my vegetarian neighbors, a vegetarian friend, my carnivore friends, and my family! It\\'s that good.', \"Where do I even start with this place.. it's so so so good! Definitely never had vegetarian food that tasted this good! We have been here 4 different times!Everything I have tried here is so good! Honestly, can't go wrong with any dish! the wild mushroom pate has to be my favorite of all time! If you do get a chance to try the tempura squash and the trumpet mushroom, it was the specials for the day, but it was oh so yummy! If you are thinking about trying this place, I highly recommend you try it!!Pro tip- bring your own bottle of wine, no corkage fee!!! Also make a reservation on Yelp, as they do get very busy!\", 'After years of going to the Carlton Hotel for Saha and the Berkeley location, I finally tried the Savor cafe.Inside there are about five tables and a very compact kitchen.Outside there were three small tables on the sidewalk, and where I was camped out.I was able to get a lunch item for dinnner. it was a Jackfruit Shawarma. Hot and toasty, it was recommened I keep the Shawarma in the paper to keep it from falling apart, but be careful, it will drip sauce at the bottom. This was my number one pick for the night. The tzatziki sauce was very bright, flavors perfect. I would definalty get this again.My second favorite item was the Mashi, a stuff eggplant. The suprise of sumac sprinkled in, corn and sauce, I ended up ording a second helping of this towards the end of the meal. These first two items were filling.My third favorite was the Knaffe. The toasted phyllo dough shell and mushroom in the center with the bell pepper sauce was fantastic. Finally I rodered the falafel croquetts, a nice crust was formed on teh falafel with a dab of sauce on top. After ordering my second helping of Mashi, I found the amount of food to be just right.Parking can be limited, I ended parking about a block away in the residential area. Service was fantastic, they were able answer all my questions and decribed dishes in great detail. There is a single restroom in the back behind the curtian.If you want to break away and try Yemeni food, this is your place']\n",

      "Reviews: ['Got a question about Ofena? Ask the Yelp community!', 'Perfect place for a gluten-free girly to catch up with friends who are craving pasta! Their Saffron Risotto is GF and delicious.Service was very quick. Restaurant is bright and not too loud -- love that we could hear each other across the table. Plenty of parking on a Monday night.', \"I drive by here every day on my way to work and I never noticed there was a little gem of an Italian restaurant.I came here on a weekend night and was informed that they were fully booked out but they had seating at the bar. Sat down at the bar and we were promptly greeted and serviced. I got the limoncello cocktail (I forgot what it was called and their menu online hasn't been updated) and the rigatoni pasta. The pasta was probably one of the best pasta I have had in the city. It was super flavorful, not overwhelming, and good amount of clams. My only complaint is that the portion is on the smaller side because I finished the whole plate...which is very uncommon for me. The cocktail was delicious and strong. The service here was great. Very attentive and quick. No complaints. I almost hate that I love this place because it's a little on the pricey side but I highly recommend Ofena and will be back!\", 'I appreciate a fine dining chef opening a restaurant in San Francisco, but the west side (and especially sleepy Lakeside Village) is not the place to do so.We went on a rainy Saturday night and the restaurant was half full, 1/3 families, 1/3 older folks and 1/3 foodie types. It\\'s a strange layout with two seating areas flanking the bar (ask for a better seat if they to sit you by the kitchen).The interior is sleek and modern and they did a nice remodel. Parking is easy and Resy reservations were easy to make.No free bread at this place, so we opted for an upscale fried mozzarella instead of foccacia, which was cheesy goodness ($14). The marinara served with it was quite spicy.Next up was the \"deconstructed\" artichoke dish, which was bland with only one artichoke heart cut in half with greens and sliced red pepper ($18). It badly needed an aioli to dip and more artichoke. Definite miss and I would skip it.We both opted for pastas, knowing it would be fairly small. Husband had rigatoni with clams in a butter sauce, which was good but he counted 8 clams ($28). I had the gnocchi carbonara, which was quite good, with chunks of duck prosciutto on top ($29). They were pretty light yet filling so enough for a meal.We completed the meal with a panacotta ($11), served with lemon curd and mandarin orange slice, which was quite good. We each had two glasses of Failla Chardonnay ($18/each) which added up, but they had a decent pour.They add an automatic 20% gratuity and though they tell you, there is still an option for additional tips on the credit card checkout. Total bill was $228 for two people and we were still hungry upon leaving. Though the food was good, I don\\'t think we will be back. If I pay $100+/head for small portions and two glasses of wine, I\\'m going downtown for fine dining in a nicer neighborhood. They need to read the room and adjust their menu and pricing to succeed.', \"I was super excited a new restaurant was opening around my neighborhood! This used to be the old Lakeside Cafe and now it's newly renovated to be more elegant but also causal. Ofena is a great Italian spot by the owner of Ju-Ni and the Handroll Project. This place is pretty spacious and has been super busy since they opened. I recommend making reservations through Resy.I've been here a couple of times with my family and we think the service is great! They are friendly and also willing to answer any questions about the menu or drinks.APPETIZERS: -Warm Focaccia with Roasted garlic, olive oil, and aged balsamic ($8): Great starter! It came with around 6 pieces! I love the focaccia and spreading that roasted garlic on top! -Funghi Misti Arancini ($16): Came with 4 total Arancini balls! They are mushroom deep-fried risotto balls and they are a great starter as well! It is just the perfect bite!PASTAS: For all the pasta, our server warned us that the pasta dishes are of smaller size and I agree. -Gnocchi Carbonara ($29) came with duck prosciutto, pecorino, and salt-cured egg yolk grated. I've had this twice and one time it was perfect and the second time the gnocchi was a little grainy.-Saffron Risotto ($32) came with grilled shrimp & squid. I love the seafood that it came with but the risotto itself was slightly undercooked. The favorite was overall good!-Rigatoni alla Vongole ($28) came with clams in a butter lemon sauce. This is probably my favorite pasta dish. The clams were huge and I just enjoy a simple sauce. SECONDI ENTREES: All the Secondi entrees come with a choice of one side. The Secondi entrees are what I highly recommend. -Pork Bistecca Fiorentina ($34): The pork was perfectly cooked! It is definitely shareable.-Beef Steak Tagliata ($49): The steak was solid! You can't go wrong with a steak!-Today's Fish Picatta (MP): It was a seared yellowtail and it was my second favorite entree! It was seared and the middle was still slightly raw.-Fried Chicken Cotoletta ($29): Probably my favorite dish! The chicken cutlet was juicy and had a perfectly crispy outsideSIDES:-Grilled Broccolini: Best side, you can't go wrong with a good broccolini with browned butter-Soft Polenta: It was pretty filling and I love a good truffle mascarpone-Crispy Smashed Potatoes: It came with a chili relish and it was my second favorite side-Romano Beans: It was in a red pomodoro sauce. I felt like it was slightly overcooked because I like my beans to have a slight crunch. DESSERTS:-Panna Cotta: The best dessert! It was silky and refreshing-Chocolate Tiramisu: Slightly disappointed because it felt like a twist on a tiramisu. It was more of a chocolate cake with espresso powder and cream.-Pumpkin Cannoli: It came with two cannolis and it was solid! Overall, I am definitely coming back for those entrees and appetizers! I do think the place is pretty pricey but I love to support a local spot. I've always had a great dining experience here and it's our go-to spot in the neighborhood.\", \"I've been noticing a lot of neighborhood restaurants opening up lately and I am here for it. Ofena is one of those places that makes you want to come back and be a regular patron. The place is spacious with some booths as well as long tables for large groups. We were seated at the window which gave us a nice view both inside and outside.  Our server was very friendly, checking in on us regularly, leaving us to feel attended to but not hovered over. I loved the delicata squash appetizer and the spaghetti with the rich beef sugo. The pork steak was very juicy and tasty. Food came out quickly and was well paced out. Next time I will try to save room for dessert. If you are looking for a solid Cal-Italian spot with a seasonal menu, this is a great place to check out. Parking is fairly easy. I'm looking forward to my next visit here.\", 'From the moment we walked through the door..it was first class service!  Amy was our server, she was knowledgeable, fun and took great care of us!  The food..in a word - YUM!!!!  The persimmon and mushroom appetizer was incredible as was the burrata.  Entrees had so many great flavors, polenta is a must and the broccolini and squash sides were perfection!!  Thank you for such a wonderful evening, and for treating us like royalty...we will be back', \"Great new Italian option for SF! Read about this place in Eater and thought it would be interesting since I've had great experiences at Ju-Ni and Handroll Project.First I will say the food is excellent. The portion sizes are reasonable for the price and everything is fresh and delicious as expected.The service was satisfactory for a casual dining spot. They don't really go beyond the norm like Ju-Ni or Handroll, but I guess that's not the target audience. One feedback I have is that since we got seated at a small table, there wasn't any space to put our stuff and there was barely enough space to put all the plates. Ideally they could provide under chair baskets or hooks to store or hang coats/bags.Overall I'd probably keep Ofena as an option. It is a little far from us to go regularly, but at least there is a stop on the M line right next to the restaurant (20ish minutes from downtown).\", \"After hearing so much buzz about the opening of Ofena (from the restauranteur behind Ju-Ni and Handroll Project) I brought the family for dinner. The ambiance was elegant yet casual and we saw a mix of couples and groups, and a few families. We sat in a comfy booth right in front of the mural depicting the opening of the Twin Peaks Tunnel, which they kept from the previous Lakeside Diner. Lots of metered street parking (free after 6pm!) and also very close to the M Muni train stop and Stonestown Mall. APPETIZERS: We started with the fluffiest warm focaccia - you can order three different toppings so my daughter had the roasted garlic/olive oil/aged balsamic and I had the butter and anchovies. For appetizers, we had the Funghi Misti Arancini (if you like mushroom risotto, imagine them breaded and deep fried!), Yellowfin Tuna Crudo, and Fried Mozzarella (a must try!). PASTAS: The Gnocchi Carbonara came w/thick pieces of duck prosciutto, pecorino, and salt-cured egg yolk grated on top. If you're a meat lover, you'll love that the Spaghetti alla Chitarra comes with beef sugo sauce, Italian sausage, and a meatball. SECONDI ENTREES: Our server highly recommended the Pork Bistecca Fiorentina, which was tender and grilled to perfection - and my husband's fave dish of the night. I really really loved the Fried Chicken Cotoletta which came w/a slightly sweet gypsy pepper sauce; the cutlet was super crunchy and crispy on the outside and juicy inside (I called dibs on the leftovers for lunch the next day). SIDES: When you order a Secondi entree, you get to pick a side of your choice from the menu, so we got the Grilled Broccolini w/browned butter that added great flavor and the Polenta w/truffle mascarpone which was heavenly. DESSERT: We had the prettiest slice of Tiramisu, and also loved the Cannoli with an amazing fresh strawberry cream filling.\", \"My husband mentioned that this restaurant opened, so we booked a reservation since we were going to the city. Restaurant sits on Ocean Avenue, illuminated with an orange neon sign. We got there a little early and got seated momentarily. We had a party of 4 so we shared a couple of dishes.Pane1) Foccacia with Butter and Anchovies - we loved the foccacia so much we ordered another. The butter and anchovies was also good. Needs more anchovies. Antipasti2) Yellowfin Tuna Crudo - Unfortunately I don't know if the fish and prosciutto worked in this dish. I like them both as separate entities in a dish I guess. It's sweet yet salty. Prime3) Saffron Risotto - The squid in this dish was quite good but the risotto was a bit salty. Prime4) Gnocchi Carbonara - Though it was good, this was also quite salty. I actually used some foccacia to eat part of my portion. Secondi5) Pork Bistecca Fiorentina - My husband had mentioned this dish was highlighted in the recent article, so we ordered it. I will say no comment as I am not a fan of this cut of pork usually. It was good but wasn't special. My husband did say he liked this better than the steak. Secondi6) Bone-in Beef Steak Tagliata - You can't really mess up a steak but my party wasn't feeling the balsamic on it. I liked this better than the pork though. Contorni (comes with Secondi)7) Grilled Broccolini - I think I personally like broccolini and the char gave it nice flavor.Contorni8) Heirloom Summer Squash Caponata - I actually loved this. This was actually one of the more flavorful dishes in my opinion .. Dessert7) Tiramisu - Not quite a tiramisu but the essence of one on a chocolate cake. It was good but so decadent, so I'm glad it was shared.Service was great at the beginning, but as it got more busy it was harder to catch the servers attention. She was very nice though.I'm a bit sad that the best thing we ate was probably the focaccia. I know they're a newer restaurant so I may attempt to come back later in the future. Their fish of the day sounded enticing and I wish we had ordered that. Service: 3.5/5 - Ambiance: 4/5 - Food: 3/5 - Price: 3/5\", \"We had a lovely date night at Ofena.  To a person, service was attentive and friendly. Our server Stephen recommended our favorite dishes.Drinks:* My hubby had a couple of Negronis and a glass of Chianti, all were very good* I'm a big fan of the non-alcoholic Lurisia ChinottoFood (all tasty):* Fried Mozzarella Carozza* Crispy N'duja and Mozzarella Arancini (one of my favorites)* Gnocchi Carbonara* Pork Bistecca Fiorentina (the other favorite)* Creamy Gigante Beans (it made us want to start cooking these at home)It's nice to have a fancier restaurant in the area. We enjoyed our dining experience there!\", 'Got a question about Ofena? Ask the Yelp community!', 'This place is phenomenal. Every dish I had was beautifully plated and full of flavor. Each bite honestly almost brought tears to my eyes.. I didn\\'t have a reservation (as it was a last minute decision) but I was able to be sat at the bar pretty quickly and received full service. Both bartenders were so friendly & attentive and gave great recommendations!My favorites were the fried mozzarella, arancini, yellowin tuna, & the broccolini. (A.k.a. Everything I ordered haha)The drinks were also delicious. My favorite cocktail was the \"c for cookie.\"I can\\'t wait to come back during my next visit! :D', \"Absolutely loved my dinner here. My family went on a Thursday and we had an amazing time. Our server was very friendly, and the service was great, but the food and drinks were standouts for us. We had a few more dishes that we forgot to take photos of. We had leftovers and were very happy to eat them the next day.  Everything was phenomenal. Didn't get photo of gnocchi, but boy was it delicious. The other pastas were top notch as well. I will go back just for the fried Mozzarella and rigatoni vongole. Can't wait to try more dishes. The space is quaint and cozy. I believe 80 seats, including bar. Love it! So happy this place is in SF.\", \"A Fantastic Feast at Ofena! Ofena Restaurant, tucked away at 2529 Ocean Ave in San Francisco, is a real gem that recently got a wonderful makeover. The new look inside is playful and cozy, creating a perfect setting for an unforgettable meal.The menu at Ofena is a true celebration of flavors, and they're not shy about giving you plenty to enjoy. The portions are big, great for those who want bang for their buck. What's even better is that they're considerate of dietary preferences when preparing your food. During our visit, my friends and I decided to share a couple of starters and a pasta dish, and boy, were we happy with our choices!We kicked off with the Heirloom Squash Giardiniera and the Chilled Artichokes for our starters. Both were fantastic, showing off fresh ingredients and the chef's talent in blending flavors just right. The colors and how they presented the dishes added to the overall joy.Next up was the Gnocchi Carbonara with duck prosciutto for the pasta course. It was heavenly, with those fluffy gnocchi and the zingy bacon creating a delightful dance in our mouths. It left us eagerly awaiting what was next.For the main course, we tackled the Pork Bistecca Fiorentina, Bone-in Beef Steak Tagliata, and Fried Chicken Cotoletta. Every dish was a masterpiece, proving the chef's skill with perfectly cooked, tender, and flavorful meats.Amazingly, even after such hearty portions, we somehow found room for dessert. The sweet treats were the perfect ending to our food adventure, leaving us completely content.Ofena Restaurant isn't just a place to grab a meal; it's an entire experience. With its charming new look, comfy vibes, and a menu that's a taste sensation, it's a genuine treasure in San Francisco. Whether you're a local on the hunt for a new favorite spot or a visitor seeking a memorable dining experience, Ofena is a spot you don't want to miss - it's sure to surpass your expectations!\", \"Ofena is such a wonderful new Italian restaurant in Lakeside! We sat at the bar (very comfortable and great service!), and had cocktails and dinner (highly recommend the 'Stemware at Dolores' and 'Lost Boy'). Ofena's menu has a wide range of small plates, pastas, and larger entrees, so you can really just drop in for a quick bite on your way downtown or have a full dinner. The yellowfin crudo and fried chicken dishes were delicious. Will definitely be coming back - what a great addition to the neighborhood!\", \"A truly worth foodie restaurant on the west side. I recommend doing it family style where you get a combination of antipasti, primo pastas, and meaty secondis. It's pricey for the neighborhood but well worth it considering it is besting many Michelin starred restaurants that rest of their laurels.\", \"This place use to be the old Lakeside Cafe and the interior still reminds me of it.  We came on a Thursday early evening and were the first customers there.  They sat us at a nice booth facing the outside window.  We started off with some house greens ($15)  that was tasty and well presented.  For our main course we had Saffron Risotto with shrimp and squid ($32), a Fried Chicken Cotoletta ($29) and a extra side of broccolini ($11).  The food was beautifully presented and that is big plus to the kitchen.  The service was also good.What I don't like about SF restaurants and this is one of them.  There are hidden charges.  When I looked on line, there were not any shown.  But at the bottom of the menu is a 20% service charge even for a small party of 2.  There was also a charge for SF health added to the tab.  I generally do not dine at places like this and that's why I prefer Italian food either in Burlingame or places that do not have these charges.  They should have just rolled it into the price of the food and try not to make excuses for extras.  This might be controversial, but I think this is deceptive and because of this, I knocked it down 1 star.\", \"Great service, our waitress was attentive and helpful. I'm going to start with dessert because that was my favorite  the ice cream came with three scoops, one  cherry flavor I wanted to take that homes and eat a pint of it all by myself, it's that good! The chocolate tiramisu, they use cake instead of lady fingers, seriously one of the best I've ever had! So much espresso flavor in every bite soaked in! I got the duck gnocchi, it was a small portion for the price, but tasty! I honestly thought I would leave there hungry, but I was full after. My friend got the pork chop which I had a few pieces of, it had so much flavor. For appetizer we shared the mushroom arancini balls, so freaking good it you love mushrooms  and the tuna crudo was also delicious! It was the perfect pairing with the melon and prosciutto. This is a place I would go back to for sure, but be prepared to pay up! Haha\", \"Such a pleasure having dinner here with friends last night!The menu and food are fantastic. I'm not Italian, but I felt like I was at Sunday dinner with my Italian grandmother! Service was extraordinary. We are so happy to welcome this great restaurant to this familiar and missed location. Highly recommend!\", 'Ofena in San Francisco exceeded expectations with a culinary experience that left a lasting impression. The steak was perfectly cooked, tender, and full of flavor, while the Gnocchi Carbonara showcased a delightful blend of textures and rich taste. A must-visit for those seeking a memorable dining experience in the heart of the city.Our server was Stephen and he made the experience even more memorable.', \"We were truly excited to support and have a new restaurant in in that area as Lakeside Cafe and Villa D'este were gone. Really happy they are taking a chance on that area for SF locals. Sadly, it was not good. I have hope though they will work this out. We'll be back in a few months. Gnocchi was a very small portion for $29 and flavors were meh. My wife got the rigatoni and it was not good. She has all the love for al dente but this was not edible. I quickly ate the gnocchi which was a few bites and my wife did eat the clams, but left the rigatoni noodles since they were close to raw. They took the food and we asked to try something else since we didn't really eat that much and were still hungry. We had the arancini which is okay. I guess it would not have been so underwhelming if the price was so high vs. what we received. Negroni and Aperol spritz were good. I guess they bumped the bill up but if the amount is distracting for me, than I know the food was a problem. Truly, honestly, hope they figure this out and improve. Gotta be tough to start a new restaurant and will try them in a few months again. Maybe other selections were executed better? Hoping they make it through. The place was packed on a Friday night, so maybe we were just an outlier.\"]\n",

      "Reviews: [\"My culinary compass pointed me towards the newly opened Collina, and let me tell you, friends, I wasn't disappointed. This restaurant is like a love letter to Italian food, written with fresh ingredients, passion, and a generous dash of creativity.First up, the spaghettini - a classic done right. Al dente perfection swimming in a pool of garlicky, buttery goodness. Simple, yet oh-so satisfying. It's like the Beyoncé of the pasta world - flawless, but somehow outshone by its equally talented sisters.Speaking of which, the lasagnette stole the show. Picture this: crispy, golden edges giving way to layers of melt-in-your-mouth pasta, bathed in a rich, meaty ragu that could bring a tear to your eye. Each bite was a symphony of textures and flavors, a culinary masterpiece in its own right.And then there was the tiramisu. Oh, the tiramisu. Forget everything you thought you knew about this Italian dessert. Collina's version is a revelation. Light, fluffy, and bursting with coffee and cocoa, it's like a cloud of pure happiness. I'm not exaggerating when I say it's the best tiramisu I've ever had.If you're looking for a new Italian restaurant in San Francisco, look no further than Collina. It's a place where the food is so good, it speaks for itself. Just be prepared to be blown away by the lasagnette and tiramisu - you've been warned!\", \"Stepping into this enchanting Italian eatery was like stumbling upon a gastronomic haven. From the moment I crossed the threshold, I knew I was in for a culinary treat. The ambiance exuded warmth and sophistication, creating the perfect backdrop for an unforgettable dining experience.Now, let's talk about the star of the show - the lasagnette bolognese. I can confidently say that this dish has redefined my expectations of Italian cuisine. The layers of pasta, meticulously crafted and delicately seasoned, harmonize with the velvety bolognese sauce, creating a symphony of flavors that dance on the palate. Each bite is a journey through Italy, a celebration of culinary artistry.What truly sets this restaurant apart is the commitment to excellence evident in every aspect. The service is not just attentive; it's a seamless dance of hospitality that elevates the entire dining experience. The staff, passionate about their craft, took the time to explain each dish with enthusiasm, enhancing our appreciation for the culinary creations before us.The menu, a carefully curated selection of Italian delights, showcases a culinary prowess that extends beyond the famed lasagnette.\", \"We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Collina. We live nearby and go to Seven Hills all the time so we were excited to try their sister restaurant in their old location.The ambiance is cozy, a bit dark but in a romantic way. The waiters are knowledgeable and funny. There are lots of lovely candles. We started with the mushroom toast, arancini and Brussel sprouts. The arancini were absolutely fantastic - crispy garlicky cheesy. Brussel sprouts were good not amazing but nice to have a vegetable. They were not fried but were roasted and topped with Parmesan, so a bit lighter than many restaurants.The mushroom toast was a bit too rich - too much crème fraiche such that it became soggy.For our mains, we shared the lasagna and the spaghettini. Both were absolutely amazing. The spaghetti was flavorful with fresh basil yet light. The lasagna was richer - it was unlike any lasagna I've ever had. I'm not a lasagna fan usually but this was fantastic. It was a meaty lasagna where the noodles got crispy - not a red sauce but a meaty bolognese. Lastly, we shared the butterscotch pudding for dessert - so delicious. Not a pudding or even dessert person - but it was amazing! Definitely coming back\", \"There is nothing better than dining out with your foodie friends and trying basically everything on a menu. That was my experience at Collina and I loved every bite. It's the type of neighborhood restaurant that made me wish I could live down the street and visit often. From the moment we walked in, the staff was very welcoming and friendly. Our server was on top of making sure we paced out our courses well. While a lasagnette and Raviolo Al uovo were delicious, the spaghettini really stood out to me. This simple dish was perfectly executed and really was the item that I kept think of after our meal. This is a great place for a date night, especially since it has such a dark interior. Make a reservation since this is a fairly small place, and bring friends so you can enjoy a number of their offerings.\", 'Service was excellent! Appreciated meeting the GM, Danny, who genuinely loved the neighborhood and business. Small, cozy environment. We enjoyed the focaccia, arancini (4), little gem salad, scallops (4), and lasagnette. All delicious!', \"My boyfriend and I are big Seven Hills fans. As soon as we heard about Collina, we knew we had to come. We came here on opening weekend and the restaurant was pretty much full. The ambiance is elegant and a bit more chic/trendy than Seven Hills. Great for a date night. For dinner, we ordered the following items: little gem salad, arancini, della fatoria toast, and lasagnette. Everything was amazing, but the arancini and lasagnette definitely stood out. I could honestly say that their arancini and lasagnette are the best I've had in SF. The della fatoria toast was also very high up there for us. Another huge plus is that corkage is only $25!! Most nice restaurants in SF charge $35+, so we were pleasantly surprised. The only reason I'm docking off half a star (4.5, rounding up to 5) is because of the portions. At Seven Hills, the pasta portions are so generous that we always have leftovers; but at Collina, we left ~70% full with the small lasagnette portion. All in all, I'd highly recommend giving Collina a try. Service is welcoming and attentive, which definitely makes the experience that much better. We'll definitely be back!\", \"Date night! The 'lasagnette' was the star of the show. Think a 20 or so layer cake of lasagna bolognese of which you receive about a two inch thick slice of. Tuna tartare with nori chips was extremely bland, though - avoid this dish. Brick-cooked chicken was very good and juicy but not amazing in any way - just a solid chicken dish. Service was fantastic!This was opening night so I'm sure there will be some tweaks to the menu/recipes along the way. Wish them the best of luck!\", \"The food and service at Collina is just ok. For the price, I'd suggest trying other restaurants in the neighborhood first. We were there for my birthday, which my husband noted on the reservation. I wasn't expecting the red carpet or a free dessert or anything, but a friendly greeting/acknowledgment would've been nice (as most other restaurants do for special occasions). It's those little things that can make an experience all the better. I got the Americano Spritz(?), tasted like a weird Kool-Aid, the focaccia bread was soft but cold, the salad was the better part of our meal, but our main dishes - the spaghettini and scallops were ok, in a 'it's not bad' kinda way. Overall we were very disappointed. I didn't even want to take a chance on dessert, so we got the hell out of there and went across the street to another restaurant instead.\", 'Collina is the quintessential neighborhood restaurant:  charming, welcoming setting; friendly, attentive staff; and, absolutely delicious food!  Collina is the little sister to Seven Hills, which is also a rare gem among SF restaurants; but, Collina is more quaint.The menu represents a perfect offering of everything you would want to eat:  phenomenal pastas--the lasagna is better than your Italian grandmother made; the spaghettini is equally delicious!  The chicken is luscious as are the scallops.  We were a party of four and ordered half of the items on the menu:  we ate family style and shared each serving.  We finished with Tiramisu, which put the ! on a perfect meal in a perfect setting.', \"Congrats Collina staff and Chefs Florian & Diaz on the beautiful execution of this boutique, comfortable, and exciting space to be in, again! My flatmates and I went out for a Friday night and Collina was the best start of the night. What we ordered: Fattoria Toast, Little Gem Salad, Lasagnette, Raviolo al Uvo, Butterball Potatos, & both desserts.First off, the staff was so helpful in helping us decide and letting us know what items of the menu have been most popular. It's so fun to hear the stories behind dishes like the Raviolo al Uvo and its' return to the plate from Seven Hills' menu. Everything was good! The toast had the most fresh, sweet, and perfectly seasoned tomatoes. The bread was toasted to literal perfection and still soaked up enough juices from the tomatoes. Little gem salad NEVER fails - well seasoned, with a Koto 'La cheese which did a good enough job to uplift the flavor. Honestly, the seasoning of the salad was the best part. Raviolo came out alone, which was less than ideal because both housemates aren't really big fans of runny eggs. They had to wait a while for food to come...considering all the dishes were Primi we were a bit confused. Raviolo was rich, well balanced with the chard on the side. My only wish is that the raviolo could speak for itself instead of being drowned with sauces & fats because the flavour is so fresh. The desserts were rich and portioned on the larger side. No complaints from a table who is sharing. Oh how could I forget - Lasagnette. We ordered two and wow the portioning was perfect. The bolognese ragu was perfectly stewed and balanced well with the richness of the cheese and spinach. Worth the price for sure and an interesting dish.I'm excited to keep an eye on Collina's menu and return to try some more amazing food.4.8/5 - im sure they'll be next to perfect once they iron out the details\", \"So excited to have Collina in the Russian Hill hood - such a lovely spot from the Seven Hills family. - The lasagnette is the dish that we can't stop dreaming about- Loved the raviolo, green goddess salad, tuna tartare, and spaghettini - The service is superb, makes you feel welcome and super at homeThank you Collina, we can't wait to come back!!\", 'Very intimate environment and very attentive staff Tasteful menu.We ordered Arancini,Della FattoriaToast it was so goodWould recommened. I am vegetarian i ordered Raviolo Al UOVO and the Spaghetti it was so good and perfect.Dessert was dilicious and pair well with dessert wine too.', 'Found this new spot as I was walking on Hyde and it looked very charming so decided to try it out. Sure enough, great ambiance, service, and food. The Lasagnette was absolutely delicious.', 'This is an Awesome spot. I Can t wait to go back to try more of the menu. I highly recommend it as a romantic date night place.', \"My husband and I had dinner at Collina, my favorites was the lasagne. I was expecting the ravioli to be the star, it didn't disappoint, but the chef really surprised me with that lasagna being so amazing.  We also had scallops and a salad.  The ambiance and staff, made the experience really special. Can't wait to go back. The staff seemed like a team that had worked together for a long time, not like a usual opening night.\", 'Great addition to the neighborhood. The lasagnette was incredible - go for this alone. Also loved the ravioli and tiramisu. Super charming spot with the cable cars riding by.', \"Came to Collina for a family dinner and had a fantastic experience all round. They hit the trifecta from the food to the service and the a ambiance. It's an A+ across the board. The lasagnette really stood out as its as unique as it is delicious with an unfathomable amount of layers of fresh house made pasta that's then seared on one side and served on top parmigiana sauce. We also loved the Raviolo Uvov. Never had a dish quite like it before. Amazing. Then finished with the Tiramisu for the perfect end to the perfect night. Actually ordered 2 more before we left. Can't wait to go back for more.\", 'The food, ambiance, and service was outstanding! This place truly is a delicious gem! I highly recommend the 48 layer lasagna that just melts in your mouth! I absolutely love this restaurant']\n",

      "Reviews: ['Flavours were great! Got the \"pizza\", chow fun, garlic noodles, mixed vegetables and crepe. Highly recommend all the dishes. We shared it family style with 6 of us. Vegetarian friendly. I\\'d recommend going with a group so you can share multiple dishes!', \"Came here for lunch with a fiend on a Saturday and had their lunch special: drink, appetizer, entree.Fantastic food! The chicken pho was so comforting. The broken rice plate was an amazing sampling of several delicious items: charbroiled chicken, pork, and beef with lots of fresh herbs and nuoc cham.Ambiance is quite chic and charming. Great for a date or a birthday dinner.Can't wait to come back for dinner!Service was so friendly. Servers answered questions about the menu and provided solid recommendations.\", 'My partner and I snagged a last minute reservation for the last day of sf restaurant week at 6pm. When we arrived, the restaurant was mostly empty, but by the time we left an hour later, it was completely packed! We loved the ambience of the restaurant. It seems like there was a lot of thought put into all the details from the wall mural, to ceiling fixtures, to the utensil holders, to the various cups for each drink.Service was very friendly and attentive. The chef even stopped by to check in on our meal and talk about his thought process behind some of the dishes!Everything was very tasty, but the standouts were the braised oxtail and the tapioca dessert. We will definitely be back to try their a la carte menu!', \"Fantastic service at nice location that see the cooking in action. Love the lunch special menu and the options that are offered. The drinks are tasty. The appetizers aren't too heavy where you still have room for your main dish. I tried the spring rolls and they were crispy and still moist inside. You will not go hungry with your main dish. Loved the fired garlic in the garlic noodles, and the chicken is nicely grilled. The banh mi sandwiches are massive and filled to the brim. Definitely try this restaurant.\", \"It felt more like a sampling menu. $65pp for the set dinner but there isn't a whole lot of food. I understand when you come to a place like this, it's more about the trendy bar Asian fusion vibe. Everything was good from the beef carpaccio to the duck spring rolls to the fried catfish. I really enjoyed the pho spice cocktail!! And coffee cream brûlée was a delicious treat at the end. It does get really loud here due to the layout of the restaurant. You've also got the open kitchen right there to add to the mix. They're very popular so by 6:30, it's really crowded. If you come early, you shouldn't have a problem getting seated. Dishes take a little while to come out but service was quite friendly, as expected at places like this. I think I prefer more cozy places so there's a certain vibe you'd be looking for when you come to Lily's. I don't think I quite got my money's worth, hence 3 stars overall\", 'Delicious food! I had been waiting to check this place out. Came with some friends on a Sunday, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. We ordered the garlic noodles with steak, duck egg rolls, and mussels in curry sauce with ramen noodles. All three dishes were super tasty. The beef in the garlic noodles was cooked perfectly, melting in your mouth. The duck egg rolls were very tender with the crispy outside perfectly complimenting the stuffing. The mussels were good too, but a bit difficult to eat as a shared dish. I also got a side of their hot sauce which comes in a little jar that I was able to take home. The restaurant has a really nice decor and ambience, and we sat at the chefs table where we could see them make the meal. Highly recommend this place!', \"We came here on a Sunday night for dinner with no reservations but were able to get table seating. We ordered two appetizers and garlic noodles, but the appetizers were huge. For two people, we were both pretty content after the appetizers. We ordered:*beef carpaccio: also came with bone marrow and a large sesame cracker. This dish was so flavorful. *bo luc lac salad*garlic noodles with surf and turf: it was the same filet mignon as the bo luc lac salad. We took it to go as we couldn't finish it after the first two dishes.For drinks, we tried the strawberry daquiri and preserved lime blended margarita. The strawberry daquiri just tasted like a strawberry yogurt. The margarita was very salted plum forward. Will definitely be back to try other menu items.\", \"The first picture Yelp shows of Lily is its door. What a pretty door! It's a medium sized restaurant, and the seating is parallel to its bar/kitchen. The chef's dog, Bo, stands guard at the front of the restaurant and very relaxed and polite-- what a good boy.They take reservations via Resy, but they had plenty of empty tables when I dined on a Sunday lunch. The interior climate of the restaurant was damp as the ventilation was poor, with some moist and muggy pockets of air hitting you every so often. Service was decent, and the food came out pretty quickly.I tried the lunch set menu which includes a beverage, appetizer, and entree. What saddens me about Lily is that it aims to be elevated Vietnamese food, which comes with the glitz and the price tag, but the flavor? For every item that came to our table, we'd have the same descriptor: mild. It tasted like the essence of a dish rather than an actual dish. The only strong item was the Vietnamese Iced Coffee.\", \"We came in on a Sunday night without reservations, not knowing it was restaurant week, and had less than 15 min wait. The RW menu was $65, and was great selection and value for a special occasion For the first course, we tried the beef carpaccio, pho, and the duck rolls. The highlight of the three was the beef carpaccio, which had incredible balance of flavor in the light marinade/dressing, with an umami boost of fish sauce and much needed citrus to cut the fat from the bone marrow on the side. The sesame crackers offer great texture contrast. The other two dishes had great attention to flavor balance as well, just less extreme flavor rangeFor the second course, we tried the Hanoi bbq pork, turmeric fried catfish, and I believe an oxtail dish. The bbq pork and catfish dishes came with lots of Banh Hoi type materials, like lettuce, herbs, dipping sauces. They also came with rice paper, and I think our server recommended we just fold the food into them and dip before eating - I'm not sure that this is recommended, I think more typical may be to moisten the whole rice paper sheet before filling. People can eat it however they want, but offering some instruction either from staff or on the menu could be helpful here, since dealing with the rice paper isn't intuitive to all. I think moistening the rice paper entirely has a more pleasant texture. The Banh Hoi woven vermicelli noodles themselves are a marvel, cut to be just the right size for the rice paper, with a nice smoky garlic flavor, and satisfying springy texture. The catfish was spectacular, arrived sizzling and lightly crispy, and had a nice bed of fried onions to catch residual flavor.The banana pudding was excellent, with nice moist texture, and great temperature contrast with the ice cream. The tapioca pudding has a lot going on, but had a nice flavor balance.\", 'Loved santel our service provider who was warm and went above and beyond to make sure we understood the menu from start to finish. So for that we will def be coming back.The bone marrow was exceptional.  All the flavors harmonized and the herbs really made this dish sang.  Highly recommend. Bun rieu was very creative and had luscious flavors.  Though being Vietnamese I still felt it could use more tomato flavorPork chop was very high quality and was a generous portion. Something I always appreciate.  Will be back for many reasons but perhaps it was the service that made the experience memorable', \"Clement Street is so much fun with lots of varieties of cuisines to eat.  I highly recommend Lily, if you enjoy Vietnamese food with Californian flair, very friendly staff, and a warm comfortable setting.  I had the lunch special ($32pp) of fried fish and noodles, which had fresh dill.  The mango salad was spicy and refreshing.  Portions are large, beautifully presented, and seasoned perfectly.  There's a super friendly guy who works here and I'm sure people would return, not only for the great experience, but to see him again!\", 'Beautiful space and ambience with a unique and fun menu. The jackfruit \"pizza\" appetizer has a flat crispy rice paper crust and topped with jackfruit, veggies, and herbs - pretty and delicious! I ordered the special crab noodle soup, and I especially enjoyed the glass noodles and various crab - be warned the portion is huge so you will definitely have leftovers.', \"Loved this place! Always walked past it on clement but finally got around to trying it out. It's a more upscale viet food restaurant and the food was so well done! We enjoyed everything we got, and the portions were huge. The staff is so kind and personable, will definitely be back!\", \"One of my oldest friends live in this part of neighborhood. I used to belong to some running clubs that took me to this part of town. When the pandemic hit this just seems too far to travel to - however my son fences in Mteam and there are lots of time to kill in the burbs of SF, All that is to say - I stumbled into this eating establishment by accident on my way to sushi. I called my friend to see if she was available to hang out and dine with me. My friend said this place has been open for three years. The place seems to have hopping ahead of a three day weekend. We did not make a reservation but found a table relatively easily. She said this is on some list and was glad we made it in! Atmosphere is pleasant. Good portion. Seems to be a cross between Vietnamese and French. Shaken beef salad is very good. 1/5 of daily protein by the look of it. We don't eat enough protein at home so I said how about filet and scallops? This is the most expensive thing on the menu. Figure it is worth sharing. To my surprise, it also comes with baguette, rice, sunny side up egg on top of rice, cheese, and pate. A very rich, satisfying, east meets west kind of dish. More for an impressive date than to dine with your kids. Might be a bit too adventurous especially with the cheese and pate.Recently I have been missing Saigon. This restaurant scratched that itch for southeast Asian countries. A date worthy restaurant for this part of town. I hope my friend and her husband would come here on a date some time -  now that we have been here.\", \"Wow, just wow. This place blew me away. The space is absolutely gorgeous, servers were attentive and helpful. And it seems like the staff love what they do. Everyone in my party ordered from the lunch special menu. I had the duck confit spring rolls and the roast beef pho dip sandwich. The sandwich was enormous and I had to take the rest home to finish it for dinner. The beef was well seasoned and the dip made the whole experience better.  My friend had the spicy mango and rice paper salad and she was very happy with it. And my mom had the bbq heritage pork noodle bowl. She loved the noodle bowl and allowed us to try some of it. The duck confit spring rolls were extra crunchy, but were a little on the salty side for my taste. All in all, run, don't walk, to check this place out!\", \"Run, don't walk.Or maybe walk quickly since there's only two days left for SF Restaurant week's promotion.  I came here today on a whim, wanting to catch up with the chef who I often bump into at the Ferry farmer's market.  Getting here around 12:15 pm on a Friday afternoon, I found most tables were occupied and, dining solo, I chose to sit at a counter seat.  Sarah greeted and seated me after bumping into chef Rob outside.  After weighing the various options, drink, appetizer, and main, I ordered my meal.  Sarah helped me in deciding on my main.  The restaurant week promotion is $30 for your choice of beverage, appetizer, and main (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=a1y8iDhD72wwMddxFqc6Ww&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q).Here's what I tried:Drink1. Saigon iced tea (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=HTlt3UIc0VlnGX9gtelxSw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Lemongrass, lychee, goji berry, yuzu honey, and mint.  I picked this since the other non alcoholic drinks had yogurt likely making them on the creamy side.  This was refreshing and not too sweet.  Be sure to stir from the bottom.Appetizer2. Ginger chicken noodle soup (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=tf5RKUtVkS6Rnd1_S94rRQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Poached breast and thigh, Thai basil, and bean sprouts.  The surprise ingredient here were the cruller (fried dough pieces mostly accompanying porridge) which gave this a crunch element.  I commented to Sarah this is an elevated mom's chicken soup.Main3. Roast beef pho dip sandwich, $5 supplement (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=y-97xkg1Q7ndJnRrT8ts6A&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Five spice roasted beef, pate, shallot aioli, and pho au jus.  I've had this before and it was as good as remember with the portions larger than I remember.  I only finished half of the sandwich and 'jus'/broth with a few bites of the salad.  The rest went home for a future weekend meal.Bonus, comped by the generous chef4. Spicy orange and rice paper salad (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=cR_ZtT7NA_oLaWAAX3dV9Q&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Brokaw avocado, tomato sambal, and Nuoc Cham.  The chef brought this out like an amuse bouche mentioning the growers' names along with the ingredients (cara cara oranges and watercress).  I jokingly asked him to write it down so I could Yelp it.  I later looked at my menu photo in identifying this dish.  Get this.  If you like spicy, yes I mean spicy, and refreshing sweetness, you'll love this.  Was tempted to face plant the bowl to catch every last drop of the sauces.There were three other diners on the front counter with me but we were well socially distanced.  As I finished my meal, a flow of diners entered and were seated including a large table towards the back.  I didn't get an opportunity to catch up with him given the crowd.  I, in passing, kidded him that I liked it better when I was dining alone for lunch, during the pandemic peak.  I deliberately posted this now to share this with interested eaters who would like to try this meal as there's only two days left in restaurant week.  Just go!\", \"This place is simply lovely. The drinks-dangerous. Perfectly sweet and addicting. We ordered the jackfruit pizza-imagine salsa and chips but even better. A great balance of sweet and salty. Definitely get it. The Hanoi BBQ Heritage Pork was so good! I love the array of textures from the lettuce, perilla, noodles, rice paper, and seasoned pork. Overall an amazing meal. I'm sad we didn't have room for dessert, but that just means we will have to visit soon. Thank you to CJ for your excellent service and recommendations. Our girl dinner was made better because of you!\", \"I came for restaurant week which was $40pp for a drink, app, and entree. The ambiance inside is lovely with beautiful decor and tentative service but the food was a bit lacking. The broth for both the appetizer pho and the dipping portion of the sandwich lacked a depth of flavor and almost had a burnt taste to it.  I would not have compared it to a pho broth at all upon taste. The sandwich was very hearty as it's loaded with beef but since the broth was a let down the sandwich ended up being very dry. I wished for something like pickled vegetables on the side to cut the monotony of just eating a beef sandwich.\", \"Their lunch special is a really good deal. I got a really great salted egg viet iced coffee, some duck eggrolls, and a turmeric fish bowl. The portions were generous and everything was great. I've mostly only had that fish dish as a big family style thing and this was more of an individual vermicelli bowl. It works pretty well as a personal portion and I think more places should do it. I definitely want to come back here for dinner. I think they do a great job of mixing traditional flavors with a little California. Big fan.\", \"Quick overview: I got to try Lily for the first time during SF restaurant week, and it was an absolute delight. Their $30 set lunch menu, which included a beverage, appetizer, and entree, was a great value. Not only was the meal incredibly satisfying, but I also had leftovers to bring home. If you are looking for a delightful blend of Vietnamese fusion cuisine, try Lily. I'll definitely return to try their other items.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~More detailed review:7/10 for the environment: The restaurant has an impressively long layout. However, the lack of windows can create a progressively dimmer ambiance as you go deeper into the restaurant.9/10 for customer service: The server had exceptional hospitality and kindly shared their recommendations. They were attentive throughout our meal, checking on us periodically to ensure we were doing ok. They accommodated our request to split the bill between the 7 of us, a rare occurrence in restaurants since splitting is often limited to just two cards.8/10 for food: Everything I had from the Sf restaurant week menu was delicious!What I ordered:*Rodriguez Farms Strawberry Sinh To (beverage): This tasted very similar to strawberry milk, and they put actual pop rocks in there.*Spicy Orange and Rice Paper Salad (appetizer): This salad has a slight kick, and the avocado is an interesting mix.*Tumeric Fried Catfish Banh Mi Sandwich (Entree): This was my favorite, I love how crispy the fried catfish was, and it went so well with the dipping sauce. The portion was huge and I had to pack the second half of the sandwich to bring home.\"]\n",

      "Reviews: [\"Beautiful Italian restaurant, although next time I think I'll sit inside. Wasn't a fan of the trolley passing by ever so often. Service was meh... it sucked lol but at least we had wine to hold us over. Food was amazing though! Definitely come for the food and bring good company. Thanks!\", \"Birthday dinner!!! Small restaurant made for dates or perhaps solo dinners. Came here for my reservation at 6:15. It was pretty busy for a Sunday evening. The waiters weren't very attentive. It took quite some time for them to get water, order food, or even just to see how we were doing. The food was good but not great. My duck liver pate as a starter was wonderful. It was flavorful and they gave me a good amount. My black cod was was cooked beautifully. The pork chop was a very different story. It was mostly fat. My boyfriend said he had to cut most of the fat off. It was very difficult to eat. They make their own sorbet in house. I enjoyed it, but it didn't sparkle. I wouldn't get it again.\", \"My new favorite Italian restaurant of all time!Came here for dinner and was greeted / seated immediately (they take reservations online, which is highly recommended because this place gets packed quickly). The inside is dark and romantic but very comfortable and effortless. This spot would be great for date night.I shared the herby focaccia, Sun Blaze Ranch Panzanella Salad, and  Chocolate Budino for dessert. For my entree I got the Agnolotti.Wow, all dishes were fantastic! The focaccia was airy. The heirloom tomatoes in the salad were meaty and juicy and seasoned to perfection. The Agnolotti was so unexpected but I loved it. It was essentially ravioli but with seasonal sweet corn. It also had some popcorn sprinkled on top. The dish was light and on the sweeter side. The Chocolate Budino was also amazing! The mousse/pudding wasn't too sweet. I was impressed. I'm a pretty big eater and I felt the portions for each dish were just right.Service was top notch. They checked on us frequently, asked if we had any food allergies before we ordered, refilled our waters, and wiped the table between courses. Everyone thanked us and wished us a good evening on our way out.I will be back to Seven Hills and would recommend this place to my family and friends!\", \"I had a fantastic dining experience at Seven Hills! Dining with friends from out of town, we were warmly welcomed by our attentive waiter, William H. His passion for food and attention to detail made us feel truly special. The restaurant's lively yet intimate ambiance added to the overall charm. The Americano Spritz was excellent, perfect for spritz enthusiasts like me. As for the food, the garlic parmesan bread and pappardelle were incredibly flavorful. No regrets here; I'm already planning my next visit to try more of their food!\", \"We celebrated my husbands birthday in the city! We made reservations in advance and were seated upon our arrival. We sat indoors as it gets cool in the evening. Table are a bit closer together but it is still cozy. The staff was friendly and personable. We had the American wagyu, marccheroncelli and the market fish. Food was simply delicious. Our server paired our food with a delicious red wine. If you're ever in the city we highly recommend seven hills it's a solid Italian spot !\", \"Seven Hills is one of my favorite date night restaurants-- the pastas change and are always the perfect al dente that reminds me what pasta texture should be. I'm always curious what new combination of house made pastas and sauces they will have on their menu. There are typically some chef specials as well with great, fresh ingredients. I have not tried them yet since they are usually pricier but it is on my bucket list. The duck liver pate had great umami flavor and I really appreciated the strawberries. I also always love their panna cotta and olive oil cake. Service was impeccable and as a light drinker, they were more than accommodating in splitting one glass of wine between my guest and I. Great wine selection too and we really enjoyed the sauvignon we picked.\", \"Oh my gosh. This is the best food and dining experience I've ever had! My bf and I came last night after hearing great things about it and boy we were not disappointed. Everything is fresh and prepared to perfection. Our server William made the experience even better! He gave us great recommendations and ensured that there was more than enough truffles on our pasta (doing the lords work lol). If you haven't come here yet, I'd make sure to make a reservation ASAP. You won't be disappointed.\", \"Seven Hills is a cute Italian restaurant tucked away in the sleepy Nob Hill neighborhood. We made reservations for three at 5:30p and were seated in the back of the main dining room. Garlic & Parmesan Focaccia: this was buttery, soft, and cheesy! So delicious to share.Duck Liver Pate: this was the STAR of the show. The focaccia bread it was served on was crispy yet fluffy and the pate was delicious. I loved the strawberry jam on top to help cut the pungent-ness of the pate. Would 100% order again Agnolotti: this was a perfectly cooked Al dente pasta. I really enjoyed the fresh corn and the fun popcorn on top. Budino: creamy, luscious, I couldn't stop eating this! The food was excellent - I wish the pasta portions were 25% bigger. If we didn't order appetizers I think I would still be hungry. Overall I would say the service is pretty good, although I we did feel a bit rushed to order, to eat, and to order more wine. Our party was catching up with a friend visiting from out of town so it would've been nice to have a bit more space during the actual dinner. I do appreciate Seven Hills for letting us move to a new table for a post-dinner drink and to finish our Budino dessert before our friend's plane ride home.\", \"One of the top 10 Italian restaurants we've been to. And that says a lot from people living in nyc. The meatballs are the best we've ever had (also impressive coming from nyc). The garlic bread, kale tagliatelle and macorencelli all fantastic.\", \"A Russian hill classic. If you're looking for an Italian restaurant in Russian Hill, Seven Hills is the best option.I come here pretty frequently, as it's two blocks away from my house.We always get a crudo and salad to start, three pastas (truffle tortellini, squid ink if they have it - these two are typically specials), and a protein (fish or steak). Save some room for dessert at Swenson's across the street, but if you stay for dessert, they have an excellent panna cotta.\"]\n",

      "Reviews: ['Got a question about Otra? Ask the Yelp community!', 'Otra takes classic Mexican flavors and adds its own touch to create some really interesting dishes. They have mushroom tacos that have such a great flavor that even meat eaters would want over other options. I usually get the fish tacos which come very crispy and juicy. Their servings are medium sized but I tend to leave pretty full.', 'Restaurant had a good ambiance for date night. The service was good but they seemed understaffed.The food is okay, the beef tacos and sweet potatoes tacos were good. The fish tacos made me sick', 'The restaurant has nice setting, and they have great selection of food. Been here many times and I can say that the food has an excellent quality. So many great variety of flavors. The tacos were all appetizing and it was well-prepared, it has lots of veggies and it so meaty!The place was cool, and its better to get reservation. Nice seating and it has pleasant ambiance. Great customer service.', \"The food here is innovative but maybe too innovative. You can't order a nice Dos Equis or a side of refritos. They just don't have it. The prices are a little too high for what it is. The service is good. The varnita tacos are good, the ingredients are fresh. But it's so dark in the restaurant you can't see the vibrant colors of fresh Mexican food! I love dark, quiet & cozy restaurants but this is not cozy or quiet. Just dark. We eat with our eyes first I'm told, but you can't see anything on your plate here. The house margarita was okay--very light pour, couldn't taste any tequila. It's a nice place with good food. Just not my kind of place.\", 'Came here on a Saturday with no reservation and got seated immediately! Good:- Charred lettuce was amazing! What a cool dish, it had cool texture too.- The mushroom tacos were surprisingly good and flavorful! - nice dimly lit place great for catch-ups- Food came fast Bad:- I thought the cod tostada had very little flavor and was expensive so not worth Overall worth trying out!', \"This place is right next to Danny Coyle's where I come in for morning soccer games over weekends and I finally gave into the temptation to try Otra as I was heading out on a Saturday afternoon.Amazing mushroom tacos! Loaded with mushrooms. The huge variety of fillings in the taxi gave it such an amazing flavor. It is sorta spicy in itself, but if you're a spice lover, ask them for their spicy sauce on the side. It makes it even better. I'd definitely rate this dish 5/5. The only downer for me was that there were only two tacos for $14, and that seemed a tad pricy despite the inflation, the location in SF, and the quality of the food. I wish there was one more taco. Maybe it's the right price and I probably didn't get the right feel of the ambiance since I came in at 11:30 AM by myself. The restaurant was fairly empty and there were less than 5 people. The lady who took my order was very friendly! I was confused if I should get another plate of tacos (sweet potato) but I didn't want to spend over $30 for a brunch meal by myself. I will definitely be back once again after another soccer game, because I want to try some of their other dishes. I rate the place 4.5/5, but I couldn't round off to 5 because of the portions for a $20 meal with tip. :(\", \"Drinkies: Jalisco 75-LOVED ITHouse margarita spicy with tequila- GREAT! Appz: Aguachile -the fish they used was super tender. It had a nice spice that creeps up on you-but could use a little more spice and flavor (just my opinion). The chips they used were great (crispy/salted). Dinner:Beef taco: pretty delicious! Would be better if they doubled the tortilla since there was a lot on one. But the beef was tender and flavorful. Recommend this one! Concha's borrachas: DO NOT RECOMMEND. Had a very fishy sus taste. We only ate a couple bites and just didn't trust it. The chorizo didn't have flavor. Ambiance is cute and romantic! Service overall was good- a little on the slower side. Clean and the decore is cute!\", \"A little loud, but the food is delicious. The waitstaff is very nice and does a great job. Can't wait to go back\", 'Finally got to try Otra! We walk by it all the time and I guess the San Diegan in me was hesitant to try this and be severely disappointed (bc we\\'re taco snobs). And I gotta say, my partner and I were pleasantly impressed. It\\'s good for what it is, this isn\\'t your homestyle/street food type mexican food. This is your \"fancy resort in mexico type\" and for that, it is good. Especially paired with their well made cocktails, thats a win. In terms of food, I recommend the beef tacos. Its not dry and has lots of flavors, ask for their habanero hot sauce if you wanna kick it up a notch. Their al pastor tacos were fine, it didn\\'t have the classic red char but it wasn\\'t bad. Drinks are dangerously good though, if you like mezcal, this is the place to try it. I liked my Paloma and my partner enjoyed his old fashion (i forget the actual name).', \"This place was very good! Not like mind blowingly good or anything like that, but a solid Mexican brunch place. Came here today with my sister and brother in law, and their pup Bailey. They have outdoor seating and it wasn't cold out (rarity in SF this winter) so it worked out perfectly. We got some chips and salsa, and I got the beef hash. My sister got the beef tacos and my brother in law got the pozole. The chips and salsa were great - only thing that could have made them better was warm chips but who cares. The salsa was certainly house made, very good kick, and surprisingly the salsa verde was a bit hotter than the rojo. My hash was nothing to write home about honestly but what can you expect, its potato, veggies and cut up beef. I guess the beef just wasn't that flavorful (didn't seem to have really any Mexican flavor to it - cumin, etc.), or tender. But it was still a solid dish. The eggs were perfectly poached with a nice orange yolk. I also tried the beef tacos and those were yummy, though my sister thought they were spicy. Brother in law loved his pozole. Will probably be back again because it is close by, wasn't busy and the service was good!\", 'Got a question about Otra? Ask the Yelp community!', \"Great spot for a nice, tasty dinner. Lots of veggie options. The two of us split the beans+chips, ensalada, and mushroom tacos. The beans+chipswas a little salty and the chips themselves weren't amazing. The ensalada was really really delicious and herby. The tacos were by far the star of the show! It was a spicy, umami bomb! They were pretty tiny tacos though, I don't think two tacos alone would have filled me up. We also each got a cocktail--tasty and strong. Service was just okay! Overall definitely recommend this place for a nice dinner out!\", 'Located in Lower Haight, this tapas restaurant offers a delightful dining experience. During my visit with a friend, we sampled the beef tacos, al pastor pork, and totopos with salsas. While all the dishes were enjoyable, the beef tacos stood out with their excellent sauce, tender beef, and a harmonious blend of flavors. They were so good that we ended up ordering seconds! The Al Pastor, though slightly chewier than expected, still offered a flavorful taste, especially when paired with the diverse and flavorful salsas that accompanied the chips. The margaritas were refreshing, striking a perfect balance between sourness and sweetness, and the option to share a pitcher was a welcomed feature. Overall, this is one of the top Latin spots in the area, and I highly recommend it to those in the vicinity or nearby residents.', \"Amazing little spot! The food is amazing. We had the frijolitos for an appetizer which was terrific. We are salsa and chips people but you have to try the frijolitos they are game changers. The beef and quesabirria tacos were both killer, but to our surprise the sweet potato tacos stole the show. This restaurant is a gem and even more so if you are vegetarian or gluten free. The marg's are no joke too. Make sure you stop here!\", \"Very tasty, but also very salty, especially the mussels that we got. With the chorizo, it would've been nice to have it a bit less salty. Enjoyed the two salsas that came with the totopos and salsa appetizer--both were complex and mouth warming. The mushroom tacos were full of umami and well-balanced, though on the mushy side if you care about textures. Everything tasted fresh and made with quality ingredients. The drinks were solid and positively cheap at $12 a pop. Service was great, and the vibe inside was great for a casual-ish date. Did this place stand out among the many great Mexican/taco places in the city? Not really. But I didn't try their meat tacos, so maybe that would've made the difference!\", \"My friend and I started off with the aguachile. If you like raw fish preparations, this is the dish for you. It was citrusy, flavorful, and VERY spicy. In our case, this was a positive but mind the spice if you're not as big of a fan. It was just the perfect thing to wake our palettes up. Also as a bonus, the portion size was bigger than I expected. For entree, we  shared the mushroom tacos and beef tacos which were a great compliment to each other. The mushroom tacos were also a bit spicy but you can ask for them without the chili flakes on top which would moderate the heat. All the dishes were super savory and delicious. The service was excellent and our waitress spent time with us walking through some dishes that would be perfect for the level of appetite we were at. I look forward to coming back with an even bigger group because the tapas format lends itself really well to sharing.\", 'Excellent foodGreat ambiance Very unique dinner that truly surprised and delighted us', 'Good food, service and beers.  I love the ambiance, the place is cute and really good for catching up with friends. We were hungry after getting a few drinks and my friend suggested to try it. We ordered the meatballs, aguachilles and the spicy broccoli and we loved all of them.', 'Love this place especially for vegetarian or vegans! Lots of options for us. They have mushroom, squash, and bean tacos and all of them are well curated and delicious. The drinks are delicious and unique. Everything we tried was amazing. Service was very friendly and the ambiance was casual while still being very nicely decorated. I loved it since it was perfect for all kinds of scenarios!', 'Wow! Otra is a wonderful spot for food in the Lower Haight. The decor of the restaurant is consistent and a fun mixing of textures all in shades of blue. At night it is cozy.In terms of the food, they do vegetables here very very well. The charred cabbage and roasted Brussel sprouts were flavorful. Each bite has the right balances of umami, salt, acid, and heat. The cod tostada was skillfully executed to preserve the fish (without going dry), keep a crunch on the tostada, yet round out the flavor profile.I had a margarita that evening and it had acidity that was delightful. It also was not heavy handed with the tequila and was balanced well. The service here is attentive without being pushy or overbearing. I thought they handed our party of seven well, and we never felt like there was a significant gap for plates to come out. Overall, I will be back!', \"Stopped by just for a drink & the cucumber cocktail was spot on as well as my michelada, we had already ate or else we would've ordered some food. The menu looked really good & the food smelled delicious. Will definitely be back to try the food!\"]\n",

      "Reviews: [\"Sat at the Chef's table on a rainy Friday.   No reservation, but was able to quickly get a spot through their walk in system.  The food was all delicious with flavor combinations that were a welcome departure from the every day.  Chef table I believe refers to a special section of the restaurant.   In our case, we sat at a large bar which surrounds the open kitchen.  It was warm and inviting and fun to watch the kitchen team in action. Service was very friendly.One nit- the thing described as baklava was closer to a stroppwafel / granache sandwich. The creativity was appreciated, but the dish was a surprise, given the description.   If you have a mental image of a dish, make sure you are getting what you expect or are excited about their version.\", \"Visited here with 3 friends, had been curious about the restaurant for a long time. My favorites: -California Tahdig -very novel with uni on top-lamb-Kibbe-Kayseri mantı -Muhammara - hard to come across decent muhammara with so many different recipes all over Middle East. This one had my favorite flavors, not sweet, not too hot, still good amount of spiciness. We tried cocktails Efendi & Anatolian Martini, both contained good amount of alcohol. Presidio is great as location. Service was quite fast, I'm impressed. I'd love to hear more music to suppress the noise.I'm on a mission to the desserts next.\", \"Snagged a spot here over the weekend with a friend visiting from out of town. The restaurant is quite beautiful. We sat at the counter, which provides a nice view of the open kitchen.Right from the get-go the staff impressed me with their service, they kindly handed us each a glass of complimentary champagne to toast my friend's engagement when they learned we were celebrating. We went with the chef's menu ($75), and it was pure deliciousness. Every course got better and better. Seriously, don't sleep on it. The lamb, scallops, and tres leches were my personal winners! Also, props to them for being cool with swapping out a course due to my friend's allergy. If you're into cocktails, go for the Lemon Kalimera. So GOOD! This is one of the best restaurants I've been to this year. I will be back!\", \"Really great meal, ordered the octopus, bread and dips, kebbe, lamb chops, mushroom pasta, and a bottle of Turkish wineGreat attentive service and lively ambiance, ceilings aren't too high and can get quite loud and livelyDelicious food, and great wine recommendationsDefinitely returning in near future\", 'Wow- beautiful restaurant in the presidio, amazing food, super friendly staff, cool ambiance.  Their menu changes frequently based on season - but rest assured the chef knows what they\\'re doing. The octopus carpaccio shined for us. Super thin slices topped with a delicious \"salsa\". The pastas were perfectly Al dente, desserts light but fulfilling. The chicken was a bit dry but overall theogony enjoyed the creative take on Mediterranean food. The place is huge- multiple rooms to cater to private parties, large main room where the bar is. Bit expensive but cest la vie in this city. Will definitely return!', \"This was all over the place - some really strong highs and some uncomfortable lows. Starting with best - the beverage program and service here is really strong and reason enough to come back. A unique and well curated selection of cocktails, NA drinks, southern and eastern Mediterranean true old world (not French) wines (we need more of these in SF!), and after dinner drinks (including a few awesome ones made in house).The food was full of highs and lows. Great flavors across the board, but a couple execution misses that hurt. We ordered the '12hr' lamb shoulder - what came out was an underbraised inedible piece of lamb filled with unrenderd fat and connective tissue and tough chewy meat - more like '2hr' lamb shoulder. I'm surprised the chef ever let this leave the kitchen. This speaks to a culture of profits over quality and raises some long term concerns of how long that can last in the customer discerning eyes... $70 down the drain. The service was full of highs and lows too. The beverage directors and most waiters were warm, friendly, and engaging. At the end of the night halfway though dessert, a waiter we hadn't seen all night came by and dropped the check unprompted. Caught off guard (we'd only been dining 1hr), we asked if we need to leave? He gave gruff and walked off. Our true waiter was apologetic but this left an uncomfortable lasting feeling in a meal that was full of highs and lows. Im sure they are looking for a Michelin rating at some point - but the restaurant appears to have too many covers to properly execute the menu consistently and the service has a few bad apples in a sea of stars. It's also really really loud in there.\", 'Dalida is a welcome dining option in the Presidio, serving upscale Mediterranean food in a beautiful setting. Husband-and-wife chef owners Laura and Sayat Ozyilmaz combine their extensive fine dining experience with Sayat\\'s Turkish roots for a modern and heartfelt menu.We opted for Chef\\'s menu, which was a curated experience of their a la carte items. They started us off with the breaking bread - a plate of wonderfully fluffy \"chubby\" pita accompanied by a spread which included hummus, muhammara, and smoked yogurt. Don\\'t miss this one.Another equally as vibrant and delicious starter was the octopus and sujuk. Extra-thinly sliced octopus was harmonious with bright, tangy olive-caper dressing and spicy fermented sausage.The eye-catching, seafood-topped California tahdig was not as memorable as its appearance unfortunately. I thought the seafood mixed oddly with the tahdig rice. I recommend the traditional saffron tahdig instead, with extra crispy rice and barberries.There is a concise Middle Eastern pasta section, including classic Turkish kayseri manti, which are meat-filled dumplings topped with yogurt and tomato sauce. I wish I tried this here, since I loved it in Turkey, but we had a pescatarian restriction. Instead we had su borek, a pan-roasted philo dough pastry with spinach and comte sauce, which unfortunately was a bit bland. I found this to be the case with the swordfish as well.The sides were strong, including forest mushroom tabbouleh lettuce wraps with great texture from crispy fava and pomegranate seeds. I was excited to see late season sweet jimmy nardello peppers still on the menu as well!I was glad I saved space for dessert. Their melon and anise ice cream was a pairing I didn\\'t know I needed in my life. And the rose tres leches cake was both airy and decadent, and a nice nod to Chef Laura\\'s Mexican roots as well.We had a couple rounds of cocktails with dinner, and I liked the Pasha, a well-balanced blend of tequila, strawberry, tomato grenadine, thyme mountain tea, and clarified milk.Overall, I would recommend Dalida for the food and setting. I found the appetizers and sides to be standout, and next time I definitely want to try some of their meat dishes like the aleppo half-chicken or 12-hour lamb shoulder tandoor.', \"If you're able to score a reservation, you're already a winner!  This is one of the hottest places to get into right now in SF and now I too can see why.  It is quite far in Presido but the setting is beautiful, quaint, and calming. As for the food, everything was delicious. You must get the Breaking Bread, aka pita (1) and spreads. It might not sound like much but the pita is THE best pita I have ever had! It is soft and warm. The Kibbe was delicious as well but know that it is just one and think of it as a small appetizer. The octopus was tasty, came thinly sliced like carpaccio. It's not your standard octopus you normally would have but it's worth trying. The surprise was the lamb manti in the pasta section. While they are tiny little pockets filled with lamb, it was very delicious and filling. You won't want to miss out on the dessert either! Service was good and the food was served very quickly after we ordered. The space is spacious so you won't feel like you're sharing a table with those next to you, which is a luxury at most places.With that, I wish you all the luck in getting a table....before I do again :P\", 'TL;DR everything about Dalida is VERY instagrammable, BUT unfortunately the food falls short and does not live up to it\\'s hype. Tucked away in the picturesque Presidio, Dalida\\'s interior exudes a contemporary Californian charm. We made reservations for a party of 5 and were seated in the beautiful inside dining room. The presentation of each dish and cocktail was visually captivating, a food photographer\\'s dream, but the cuisine didn\\'t match the hype. While the cocktails were great, I wouldn\\'t expect any less at the steep price point. the food was lackluster and the flavors were bland. Here\\'s the rundown:- Octopus & Sukuk (2/5) - EXQUISITE presentation, thinly sliced octopus adorned the plate. Too bad it lacked flavor, especially at its $26 price tag - Half Dozen Oysters (2/5) - While the oysters were fresh, it was hard to ignore the presence of shell fragments and intact muscle. For an upscale establishment charging almost $5 for ONE oyster, this was disappointing. - California Tahdig (2/5) - Again, STUNNING presentation on a bed of golden saffron rice adorned with uni, trout roe, halibut, and caviar. Despite all the premium ingredients, their flavors together achieved no synergy. FYI - this thing was $44 a pop yet definitely NOT suitable for \"family style\"  - Breaking Bread (4/5) - As someone with pretty high standards for the carbs i put into my body, I thought this dish was the star of the show. Two generous pieces of freshly baked pita bread encircling a captivating medley of hummus, muhammara, smoked yogurt (the best!), and various pickles/olives. The harmonious flavors was delightful - seamlessly blending the the nutty richness of the hummus, tangy allure of the smoked yogurt, savory notes of the olives, all wrapped in the warm embrace of the oven fresh pita. - Fattoush Salad (3/5) - Another beautiful dish with all the colors of the rainbow. I enjoyed this salad with the sweetness of the heirloom tomatoes, stone fruit, balanced out by the cucumber, fennel and feta. But it lacked anything distinctive and tbh I could have made this at home - Crispy lamb ribs (3/5) - This one was less \"pretty\" compared to the others, with a few small pieces of lamb with bone intact served on a plate. The taste was okay and it was indeed crispy, but failed to stand out. - Kayseri Manti (1/5) - I had very high expectations for the lamb dumplings and tomato sauce, but the disappointment continued. These manti came out surprisingly dry, devoid of any lamb or meat flavor. To make things worse, a mysterious film coated the manti which made it appear reheated ... potentially by a microwave- Cauliflour (3/5) - Charred at the top but again nothing special.- Desserts - we ordered several, but I didn\\'t eat any, so it would be unfair to rate. However based on my friends\\' commentary the pistachio baklava was the best oneService won\\'t receive a markdown for what I assume to be an one-off experience. Our initial server was helpful at first, but became insistent on upselling, even after we declined mulitple times. Once he finally got the hint that we are not interersted in additional entrees, he completely ignored us for the rest of the night, even when we tried to order more cocktails and desserts he was nowhere to be found. But thankfully, another attentive staff member came to our aid, taking our orders and offering assistance.Overall, considering the price (~$130 per person), the distance to travel here, and bread being the standout course, I would not contemplate a return visit. I would also not recommend this place to anyone except for food photographers/influencers', 'I visited Dalida Mediterranean restaurant two weeks ago, and it was an exceptional experience. The Kayseri manti I ordered were a burst of flavor, with a delightful meatiness and a tangy tomato sauce that added the perfect balance. The \"breaking bread\" dips and bread sampler were a testament to the restaurant\\'s celebration of tradition; every dip was a delight, but the smoked yogurt dip stole the show.I also tried the Shepard\\'s pipes cocktail, which, although stronger than expected, still impressed with its taste. The restaurant\\'s ambiance was inviting, creating a wonderful atmosphere, and the attentive and courteous wait staff added to the overall charm of the evening. It was a memorable dining experience that I would highly recommend.', \"4.5 starsA gem of a restaurant in the Presidio so you should get there early for the breathtaking views on a little walk before you dine. The restaurant interior is stunning and our waitperson had been the artist who did the murals.The tasting menu was very reasonably priced and it was all delicious and beautifully plated. It's hard to say what was more delicious. There was a great variety of colors, textures and flavors to feast the eyes and mouth.If there was a let down, it was the non traditional baklava. If they had called it something else we would have been delighted, but it wasn't baklava.While the staff was friendly and personable, we felt rushed. The pre dinner drinks came out long after the apps. The dishes kept coming and at times the table was packed with dishes.I want to go back and order from their regular menu.\", \"We went to Turkey earlier this year and absolutely fell in love with the food! So when we learned about Dalida we had to try it -- and it did not disappoint!  We sat at the chef's table and had a great time watching the kitchen prepare all of the dishes. I was completely captivated with the bread station.  I loved seeing them roll the dough and watching the bread puff up as it baked in the open oven. In terms of food, be sure to order the octopus (Sujuk) and the freshly baked bread.  We were also impressed by the lamb, which was super tender and had flavors reminiscent of the holidays. I wasn't a fan of the stuffed mussels because it seemed odd to serve rice cold. The cocktails were fun and really beautiful, but they were on the small and the light side.\", 'Food is excellent. Everything tastes delicious and amazing. Decor is cute. Comfortable chairs and tables. Nice bar. Service is only okay; may need a few extra servers and hostesses.Overall, solid 4 stars.', 'Amazing place in the beautiful Presidio park. Go for the atmosphere which is warm, inviting and festive as well as the outstanding food. We got the tasting menu which allows you to try almost all the best options on the menu. We had an amazing family dinner and chef sayat came to check on us and take a fun picture for my collection of me posing with amazing chefs!', 'Lovely setting and a lovely space. Sadly. our very chatty server flipped between taking our order, making recommendations, talking us out of dishes, making more recommendations, and not writing anything down...resulting in a good number of errors with our order. Food was gorgeous and pretty good but very, very pricey. It might be good to try here again after some of the service kinks get worked out.', \"The puffy bread with dips was hands down the best thing I have eaten this year.  Unbelievably DELICIOUS.  Perfection.  Seriously, PERFECTION.  We ordered two salads, and they were incredible.  My mushroom pasta was simply awful, dry dry dry.  Utterly inedible.  Undercooked and dry dry dry.  I'm surprised the kitchen would send that to a table, at a restaurant like this.  Bad, REALLY BAD.  And nobody asked why I only one bite of it when the plates were cleared.  Having said that, the service and puffy bread were SO GOOD that I will give five stars.  (I'm surprised that a restaurant like this has no idea how to make and serve pasta.  My mushroom pasta was completely inedible, and nobody noticed or cared that I didn't eat it.)\", \"Checked this place out and luckily made a reservation. It was pretty busy upon arriving. Inside is beautiful and open. There is also a side room for smaller private events. Servers were friendly and checked on us thru the night. We decided to do the chefs menu. There wasn't an actual menu to go off of and they stated it could be different dishes between tables at the same night if ordering the chefs menu. We tried some cocktails and wine and all were really balanced, beautiful, and tasted great. The food was all really delicious. We had pita and dips, fattoush salad, and mussels to start. Then we moved on to crispy ribs, pork shoulder, seasonal vegetables, and saffron tahdig rice. Dessert was a variety of 3 dishes and all were great. Every dish was flavorful, great texture, and so delicious. Pita was soft and fluffy, dips were delicious and nice to have different textures, the salad was bright and refreshing, and pork was fall off the bone tender. The rice had a nice crisp to the outside and color and everything went well together. Dessert was refreshing and loved that it wasn't too heavy or rich at the end. I'd definitely come back and recommend.\", \"Hands Down!!! From entrance to last second - totally epic service ! Every each of employees is so polite, so helpful, so detail oriented! I literally have seriously never been in a place where every employee puts  of their efforts and perfect manners by heart. Food is so authentic, and wine list is perfect ! It is not a loud restaurant, and chairs are so comfortable, restrooms are clean, it is right at perfect spot to find parking. I wish there was a chance to give more than 5 stars. I sincerely haven't been in a place in harmony. Especially appetizers are off this world ! You will not disappointed, and you will leave this place happier than you walked in.\", \"Zero bad things to say about Dalida and the prices are so good! If you don't have any crazy allergies and you're fairly adventurous with your food get the CHEF'S MENU. They curate a lovely dining experience for you with different types of flavors and colorful dishes. There will be an appetizer, main, and dessert rounds. The portions are pretty large. With the amount of food I had, $75 was such a steal. ENJOY! PS: My friend and I couldn't get a reservation, but if you're there right when they open the bar seating is left for walk-ins.\", \"What can I say---Chef Laura and Sayat are a phenomenal team. I've been a fan of theirs since their Istanbul Modern pop-up days and I'm so so glad they have this fantastic restaurant that has been years in the making. My husband and I had to do the chef's menu, of course. It started with the Breaking Bread plate that came with the fluffiest fresh hot pita that could only be described as pornographic as you tear it open and the hot steam pours out. My partner was properly obsessed with the smoked yogurt. The twist on dolmas surprised us both as they were encased in a mussel shell. I'm not a huge fan of dolma and my husband detests mussels, but this interpretation brought us together in harmony. Everything paired so nicely with a light red Armenian wine.The feast continued with lamb ribs, beef kebabs...by the time we got to the lamb shank we were so full (didn't help my husband ordered extra pita). The team gave us a respite before dessert, which was much needed. I honestly don't know exactly what we had, one was a rich chocolatey-coffee mouse and the other was a tart cherry Turkish style ice cream---the two dishes balanced each other so well. I was alternating bites between each dish. For $75 pp, it's definitely worth it. Can't wait to go again soon with more friends to try more plates. Bravo to everyone at Dalida, we're already big fans.\"]\n",

      "Reviews: ['The price is reasonable and food quality is good. I went there at 13:00 on Thursday. No need for waiting.', 'Good food and nice ambiance! enjoyed the date night with my wife. highly recommended, I need to come back for their brunch.', \"So here's how it goes. Whether dining in or taking out during the earlier time period, everything is ordered from the bakery display area when you first walk in. Secondly, please buy all things ube and always ALWAYS purchase a slice of the strawberry passionfruit cream pie. The guys behind the counter are pleasant and willing to answer questions. Everything is packed nicely for you.The seating are if you wish to dine there is more like an experience. You are transported to grey skies somewhere in France where the mind can wonder as you sip your coffee. Aged meats hang in a nearby window. The place has old world vibes.Most importantly, every French pastry is done EXQUISITELY. Try everything here at least once!\", \"The freakin audacity to set the default tip to 22% when you don't do jack to earn it. We got to the restaurant, stood in line, ordered the food and went to find a seat. Then got up, picked up our own cutlery, brought our own water, requested 3 times for someone to bring us some plates for the bread we ordered. Got up to get water refills and on top of all that they screwed up 1 of our orders. Was the food good? Ya. But was it good enough to bring us back? Hell to the no. I got the kimchi rice which was flavorful and a bit spicy, right up my alley. My sister got lobster omelette which was also good but not phenomenal for that price. My BIL ordered steak with fries and side order of eggs but they never brought the eggs. Who knows, maybe we were supposed to fetch the eggs from a nearby farm, our bad. And my hubby got the shakshuka, and although it wasn't bad, I think he makes a much better shakshuka. Ambiance was cool, we sat outside and got some vitamin D. It was mostly nice until it got too hot but by that time we started to wrap up anyway.  Anyway  I'm still confused as to why we left 22% tip. The tipping situation is getting out of hand here.\", \"/)/) ( . .) ( づ first of all: 4% service fee + 20% tip for self service at brunch? You order first and then get to choose a table and sit. It's not even real restaurant service. We had the short rib burrito which was a wet burrito btw it didn't say on the menu I believe. Solid but nothing outstanding. The cauliflower nachos were good! The pork sandwich was not really that good. It was kinda dry and the bread was just not matching the meat. The meat was also so little that they gave you. Salad and dressing that comes with it is not really that tasty... All in all I had high expectations of that place maybe that's why I was so bummed. Ambience is cute tho. But idk if it gets full if you want to sit next to bunch of strangers sharing a table.\", \"My friend recommended this little brunch spot and I was so happy to check it out. It's first come, first serve so come early if you want to try one of the many delicious pastries. Just wait in line, order, and find a table. My friend swears by the bread pudding, but the person in front of us ordered the last one. Booo! No problem lots of other stuff to try.For brunch, I wanted to order everything! The table ordered the potato pancake (with smoked salmon), French toast (tastes like creme brûlée), the burger, fries, eggs, and a couple of pastries. I ordered the Vietnamese latte, which is made with condensed milk. Yummmm! This place gets crazy busy so don't be scared by the long line, it's worth it. Since they are so busy, attention to detail can be a little dicey. Forgot our water, smoothie, etc. this happened across the board with different servers. There is valet parking. I circled the streets and found metered parking, which is free on Sunday. Score! Can't wait to go back!\", \"Wonderful experience at Republique that lived up to the hype. We ate dinner and brunch the following day since we liked it so much and wanted to try the pastries.For dinner, they have an upscale feel without feeling too stuffy. We got the baguette with pan drippings, Belgian endives, the Cod, Duck confit, French fries, and the apple date tart. Everything was delicious and well-balanced. Service was great and you can tell they have standards there. Wine list is also very extensive.For brunch, it is a little hectic since you wait in line, order, and then find a seat. However, the price point is lower though still on the higher end, but it is worth it. The pastries alone are worth waiting in line. We got the shakshouka, brioche French toast, and shrimp and grits. The brioche French toast was one of the best brunch items I've eaten. It was thick but still airy and crispy. The rest were pretty good but would probably order something else next time.\", \"I heard about Chef Margie Manzke's legendary work. It's great to check it out finally. Here was my experience.AMBIANCE:Parking: Street parking, mainly metered parking. It gets competitive, so I suggest ride-sharing.Seating: Plenty of seating for about 100 people or so. Great for large groups or small groups.Vibes: Welcome to El Lay! Plenty of gems from things to eat, sightseeing, and other entertainment. The spot itself is a pleasant gem. For some reason, it looked Diagon Alley from Harry Potter from a distance. The spot itself was clean and spacious. I dig the lite rock music playing in the background. It comes off as a quasi-classy place but still family-friendly. Great for a food adventure or date night.FOOD:Ube Latte (Recommend)Delicious and comforting. Ube has a subtle nutty and vanilla flavor with a pleasant purple aesthetic.Koshihikari Rice (Recommend)Another familiar and comforting dish. The shimeji and maitake mushrooms provided savory flavor and protein-esque comfort. The takana gave a nice soy sauce taste. The supergreens and radish gave it a nice refreshing touch. The poached eggs was different and looked lovely. Finally, the avocado had a different feel to things.Bacon Steak (Recommend)I ordered this at the side and it was well worth it. A very thick smokey and savory slice of bacon. It was juicy and just melted. It had a good balance of meat and fat. I added this to my rice and it complemented it very well. Chocolate Chip Cookie (A-Ok)Overall it was good, aesthetically, it looked great, and it was crunchy and chewy. This may have been an outlier, but I felt like the chocolate wasn't well spread throughout the cookie. Ube Crinkle Cookie (Recommend)This delight is trending, especially if you look for Filipino stores or bakeries. It does hold it down - subtly sweet and sizable; its softness stood out from other crinkles.Poptart - Mixedberry & Nutella (Recommend)This was my favorite out of all of them. It was not your usual from the store Poptart, so that was a delight. The mixed berry was sweet and complemented the Nutella well. Pandan Brioche (Recommend)Pandan is a Southeast Asian plant that gives sweet/coconut/vanilla flavors. The pandan was subtle and blended well with the cream inside. The brioche itself was delightfully firm and soft.CUSTOMER SERVICE:Great! It was a super busy day but people were friendly, quick, and professional.TL; DR OVERALL:5 Stars. Lovely! Great selections, reasonable prices, and a pleasant experience. This place lives to expectations and I look forward to coming back to this place.

If you want to get seated inside without bakery goods, you need to head in and order before being self seated.we ordered four dishes, which was plenty for three people. - Maine lobster omelette: 3/5 - the omelette was cheesy and buttery. There wasn't a lot of lobster for the price you're paying. The greens/salad was not that fresh either, you can see the gray leaves - kimchi fried rice: 3/5 - it was alright, nothing special about it which was disappointing since everyone raves about it - potato pancake with salmon: 4/5 - the potato pancake was a little dry, could use some help there but the salmon and the egg helped and complimented the dish\", \"The line for this place was insane but I totally understand why. The space itself feels like something out of Harry Potter -- there's a long cafeteria style table in the middle of the room that you can share with other parties, or you can choose to sit at individual tables if you're lucky enough to snag one. I honestly did not expect that much from the food, but everything from the flavors to the presentation really surprised me. The sweets were light and had really fresh fruit flavors, and the potato pancake was just so beautiful I didn't want to eat it. Will have to come back to try more items on the menu!\", \"Plenty of street (metered) parking or you can go the easier route and pay for valet parking. This place is popular so make sure to arrive early or prepare yourself to wait in line (which goes by pretty quickly) The atmosphere is cozy and cute! Reminds me of a lot of Hogwarts. The pastries were EXCELLENT! The breakfast I grabbed was the $18 avocado toast and it was good but I'd much rather go back for the pastries vs the breakfast. I tried my bf's potatoes and they lacked flavor. The service was great, I feel like the restaurant needs to change their number placards from cups to something more visible for the employees to find which items go to the appropriate table, just an observation for a logistics standpoint Anyways, overall it was good and worth trying\", \"Republique ´a beautiful michelin starred resto for the thxsgiving foodie postline here is long bc it's so popular but vibes n food made it SO worth, french-inspired bakery, cafe, dining with exquisite interiorif u can snag a res then the tables up in the 2nd floor would b such an amazing experience, near perfect rating 4 republique bc no choice is a bad one here, too hard 2 choose a fav dishorder: matcha rasp bundt cake, honeycake, passionfruit coconut cake roll, ube cookie, pandan muffin, bombolini, strawberry passion fruit cream pie, mushroom toast, smoked salmon& regular breakfast\", \"République presents brunch and dinner crafted with French technique and modern touches. Like me, if you're not a morning person, then a visit here might change your tune. This is the place for an ultimate brunch experience with berry topped waffles, brightly colored tomatoes on toast, pupusas, and croque madame. Soak in the eclectic music alternating between the Fugees and Stevie Nicks, while sitting by a wood fire.Kimchi Fried Rice: The bed of zesty, orange kimchi-flecked fried rice is completely covered by toppings. There are round radish slices, crunchy golden pickled radishes, scallions, and sprouts. Tender morsels of beef short rib melt in your mouth. A large handful of sesame seeds adds crunch to the rice. Break the yolks of the soft poached eggs and stir it all up. Red Fresno chilies add a sweet and fruity taste.\\xa0Passionfruit lime tart: A lime curd bursting with passionfruit flavor is topped with a coconut cream.Dining area: You've made it to the cathedral of cuisine.

But, if you message me, I might tell you where to find free 2-hour parking.\", 'This place can have a line going down the block on the weekends. Thankfully, I came here on a random weekday morning while in town and the line was negligible. I had an avocado toast, croissant, and an unsweetened ice tea for breakfast.  The avocado toast was delightful and loaded with vegetables. Additionally, the croissant buttery and flaky. Aside from the food, the ambiance and decor really stuck out to me. The inside gives off modern french ambiance. The seating area in the center also has views of the kitchen and the workers making bread, pastries etc which I thought was a nice touch to the overall experience.', 'Finally had an actual brunch here. The potato pancake with lox was astoundingly good. We loved the kimchi fried rice as well. As usual, the pastries were perfect, especially the seasonal scone (raspberry chocolate).', \"I got up at 4am to drive to LA to make the time to make it to Republique, and I can say with confidence that I'd do it over again if given the chance! Despite living in LA for several years, my first time at Republique came after I moved away. Clearly a foolish move on my part. Now that I have tried their food and basked in their gorgeous ambiance, I am already planning a return trip. RIP my wallet and gas bill...My friend and I arrived near opening so we didn't have much of a wait. However, while we were in line hemming and hawing over their gorgeous pastry case, a gigantic line started forming behind us. The brunch gods must have been smiling down on us, as we were able to order and find seats with little fanfare. While we waited for our food, we looked around us and wow, the photos don't do it justice. It feels so well-designed and magical inside, striking a good balance between classy and casual. I loved the soft lighting, natural wood, and giant meat cabinet. Seriously, that thing was HUGE. I almost gave up our nice window seats to be closer to the charcuterie and aging meats. I had to take a moment after my previous paragraph to collect myself before starting my recollection of Republique's food; just the thought of the mushroom toast is making me salivate, and I ate dinner no more than 10 minutes before I sat down to write this. First off, I've heard good things about Republique's bread, and the slice we got in our toast was definitely one of the tastiest European-style breads I have ever eaten. It had a perfect amount of chew with a crisp crust that did not shoot out shrapnel when prodded with a dinner knife. Atop this thick, heavenly slab was an umami MOUNTAIN: perfectly tender ham, sauteed maitake (hen of the woods) mushrooms, scrambled eggs - perhaps just a tad more cooked than I would have liked - and a deceptively simple red wine sauce just bursting with flavor. Each bite was a religious experience, and I was genuinely sad as the food on my plate dwindled. Both my friend and I lingered over the last few forkfulls, reluctant to let this dish end.Now that I've gotten all of the mushroom toast-indued ecstasy out of my system, I can say that their coffee is great and that their pastries definitely live up to the hype. I got the Vietnamese latte which was smooth and didn't have a bitter aftertaste. The latte art was cute and I like the cup that it was served in. My friend and I split a matcha black sesame pound cake and a pistachio and salted caramel croissant confection (looked like a croffin). The pound cake was good and not too sweet, but not very surprising. Now that I know just how good Republique's pastries are, I will not play it safe next time I return. Case in point: the pistachio pastry was not something I'd normally get but it was definitely the star of the show. Salted caramel and pistachio made a gorgeous, indulgent flavor combo, and the flaky crunchy-bottomed pastry was the perfect vehicle for the textural bliss that was custard and nuts. I have historically found myself underwhelmed by croissants that were anything other than croissant-shaped. Perhaps changing the way the dough comes together disrupts the moisture or elasticity or something (can you tell I am not a baker?), but many of the novelty croissants I've had in recent memory (circle croissant, cube croissant, cronut, etc) have been dry on the inside, soft on the outside, and generally disappointing. Not this one! The pastry was flaky on the outside with the soft, buttery inside layers that I love. I was quite full and still savored every bite.Republique has been living rent FREE in my head since I went, and I am quite sure my friends are sick of me ranting about the life-changing toast and pastries. I absolutely cannot wait for my next trip to LA where I hope to get a whole loaf of their wonderful bread as well as a reservation to try as much of their dinner menu as I have the stomach space to fit. From fresh ingredients to impeccable execution, the food here is something I don't mind paying more to eat, as I truly get my money's worth.\", \"Love this place. Has a great ambiance and delicious brunch. A large variety of deliciously baked goods. I loved the shakshuka for something savory, it's rich in flavor. The waffle wasn't anything to write home about but was solid. The Kouign aman had a perfect texture and a delicious pistachio raspberry flavor that paired well. The line can get kind of long here to be careful coming g during typical busy hours.\", 'I ate here on a Wednesday morning before heading to the LAX Airport. It\\'s a beautiful restaurant. I didn\\'t do enough pre-trip research, so I messaged someone I knew in college who currently is a grad student at USC Marshall for recommendations. She recommended this place, saying it was \"very popular\". I brought my two suitcases with me, and was able to place them next to my table in a non-disruptive way. It is self seating but there is ample seating!This type of menu is definitely up my alley. I liked all the Asian-ingredient touches in an area that has a large percentage of them. Coming from Atlanta, we have *some* options but nothing that\\'s like this. I ordered the black sesame latte, the raspberry matcha bundt cake, and the koshihikari rice. The black sesame latte was decent, but nothing extraordinary. I was most impressed by the bundt cake. The rice may have been a good recommendation from the cashierperson, but I think I would have preferred something like a more traditional brunch item.', \"Worth the hype for breakfast and pastries!I came with a friend around 8:30am on a Sunday. There was already a line and it took about twenty-ish minutes before we got inside to order and sit down. Considering how bad I've heard this like can get, I think we got off pretty easy. Finding a table was also really easy as we didn't want to sit in the middle of the space and opted for a nice window seat. I got the ricotta toast with seasonal fruits and it was so delectable. My friend got their burrito (I stole a lil bite) and it was also extremely tasty and really rich in flavor. Although not pictures I got the black sesame latte (which I don't think had any caffeine) that I loved. I took some pastries to go for the rest of the week and each one was better than the next! The chocolate croissant was a classic, the little oat cake with fruit I thought would be my fave but the fresh berry and fruit cream filled croissant really took the top spot for me. I'll gladly come back again though will probably order from the little pick up window for pastries and bakery items. That really seems like the move.\", \"Caught them at the perfect time (just after 11 am), with no wait or need to hurry us along.SERVICE (5 stars)Excellent in all respects. Staff were helpful and courteous when ordering, paying, and serving, and checked on us at appropriately-timed intervals.AMBIENCE (5 stars)An understated industrial vibe, with elements of elevated hip, and a touch of glam at the bar. Enjoyed their selection of background music.MEAL  (4.5 stars, overall)* Avocado Toast. Definitely the highlight of our meal, with no skimping on ingredients, stacked high and absolutely delicious. (5 stars)* French Omelet. Surprisingly, a let-down. Ours was on the dry and bland side. Underwhelming. (3 stars)* Bread Plate. Fresh out-of-the-oven deliciousness, served with more than ample amounts of creamy butter and jam. (5 stars)* Café Lattes. Aromatic, rich, frothy, robust yet smooth; the perfect accompaniment to our meal.

      "Reviews: [\"Visited L'Antica Pizzeria Da Michele before a matinee show at the Pantages theater. Tucked away in what seems like a former residence, it's a bit off the beaten path in Hollywood, but well-marked signs guide you there. Valet parking is available, which is handy given the location.On a Friday afternoon, the place was moderately busy, but we were seated quickly at the bar. The wait staff was attentive, and on their recommendation, we switched our order from pasta to pizza. This turned out to be an excellent choice. The pizza dough was exceptional - thin, chewy, and glutinous, just like in Italy, topped with eggs, Guanciale, and possibly ricotta. It was a melt-in-your-mouth experience.We also tried the steak salad, which was fresh and beautifully prepared, with the steak cooked perfectly to medium. The visit left us eager to return and explore more of their pizza offerings.\", 'Came here on my boyfriend\\'s birthday on a Tuesday to surprise him with a nice Italian dinner. I was super excited, made reservations far in advance and of course put in a request to sit outside in the cute backyard patio area, and was looking forward to it. The experience, though, was not really a good one. We got to our 6pm reservation on time. Walked up to the host, told him we had a reservation, and he was just SOOO dismissive to us the entire time, not nice at all. He led us to a little table right near the front door, and kind of just dumped us there. As he was leaving, I asked \"oh is there any way to get a table outside?\" and without any explanation or anything he just said \"no\" rudely and walked away. Fine, I get it, a request is not guaranteed and I respect that, but I do not appreciate being treated like crap at a nice restaurant. We sat down upset, and to make things worse: the table was wobbly. Also while we were sitting there waiting for our server, we could see and hear customers who came in AFTER US ask to be seated outside and the host said \"No problem!\" and walked one party to sit out there and to a another party he was at least kind enough to say \"there\\'s no availability outside and there won\\'t be for maybe 45 minutes.\" I wish he had taken the time to at least tell us something like that versus just writing us off. Anyways.. We waited like 5-10 minutes for our server to finally walk up to our table, where I then told them our table was wobbly and we would like to move. Our server was kind and said she would see what was available, then walked off. Then about 2 minutes later, the rude host walks over to us and says \"oh a table just opened up in the outside patio are let me take you there now.\" Keep in mind again, we were sitting near the only front/exit door, so we know NO ONE had left while we were sitting down. So he definitely lied and just didn\\'t want to give us the outdoor seating in the first place??? And when we got outside, there were plenty of open tables. I wish I got that male host\\'s name that was working on Tuesday 11/21 ~6pm because man, he ruined the entire experience for us. Our new server came over and was nice, took our order, and was attentive enough. Drinks were good, food was good, however birthday was not acknowledged even though I said it was his birthday, but I think overall the service we got in the beginning put a bad taste on the experience from the beginning and was enough to keep us from coming back here. Service REALLY matters, especially when you\\'re the first person customers are interacting with. I wish we could\\'ve had a better experience or I wish I took my boyfriend somewhere else for his birthday, but what\\'s done is done and at least the drinks were enjoyable.', \"Came here for an early dinner before a show at the Hollywood Bowl and had a good time! We sat in their enclosed patio outside which is nice and has lights, heaters, and a cute fireplace. We parked in a structure nearby but they also have valet parking available.We ordered:- orange wine- shirley temple- caesar salad- cacio e pepe pasta- pesto pizzaEverything was delicious! Service was fairly slow but it was okay because this is a good restaurant to hang out and have conversation. Great option if you're in the area and if you have a show at the Hollywood Bowl to catch!\", \"Came here after watching a show at the Dolby for a late night dinner.  Pulled up to valet across the street and the Attendant wanted to make sure we had a reservation and that the kitchen was still open since we got there around 10pm.  The posted closing time on Yelp was midnight so we were fine. We didn't have a reservation but we were seated quickly and waitress was very attentive.  Of course after reading all the reviews, we ordered the margarita pizza added the prosciutto and arugula.  Wow this tasted soooo good.  Crust was super thin, sauce was so tasty and the combination of toppings hit the spot.    Even though we probably could have just stuck with pizza, the pastas sounded delicious so ordered both the pappardelle genovese and the bolognese tagliatelle.   I liked the bolognese better as the pappardelle had a sweeter sauce.  Overall very delighted with dinner, service and ambiance.\", \"This restaurant is a chain of the famous restaurant in Naples, Italy. Since I had tried the location in Naples, I wanted to see what's the difference. And I can tell this Hollywood location caters to the Angelenos because they add a lot of extra toppings while in Italy, pizza is very simple. Food was delicious. Pizza was authentic Italian and flavorful. I loved how the pizza dough was thin yet chewy and fluffy. My only callouts were the dough was a bit undercooked and the pizza had extra toppings of cheese that really wasn't needed and felt a bit heavy since there already was globs of cheese at the bottom. Grilled octopus was delicious. Squid ink pasta with seafood was very tasty but a bit spicy for my palette. If you have heartburn or indigestion, you might wanna avoid this dish. Calamari was also yummy, crunchy and perfectly battered. Branzino entree was excellent with clean flavors.  Service was very nice. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. Orders came out on time and paced well. Ambiance is an interesting mix of modern contemporary and classic. Courtyard is lovely with fireplace and lights while the patio was just typical outdoor simple modern. I would definitely come back here again and try new dishes.\", 'Went on a Saturday night. Very vibe and atmosphere was great, food was amazing and delicious, and the staff were friendly and nice! We got 2 drinks, 2 appetizers, and a pizza - our total was $140. Will def go back.', \"Food is AMAZING! Celebrated my partner and I's anniversary! In the past for to go: We have ordered a double margarita to go before, and it was literally eaten within 15min because it was so good.   this made us come in for our anniversary! We ordered the Truffle Pizza (real truffles as is) and the quality and flavor is worth every penny. We also ordered the beet pizza which balanced the dish. The flavors are incomparably fresh , flavorful, and complimentary of one another. HIGHLY RECOMMEND! The ambience is beautiful. Good date night. Service was little slow overall - definitely professional and made the night wonders. The server was very knowledgeable and kind. It seemed busier for a week night since we sat around waiting for a bit between water/drinks, food, and dessert. Everyone here from the hosts to the busser/food runners were very kind and helpful. They did take care of our desserts for our anniversary which was very sweet! Definitely coming back!\", 'My brother raved about this restaurant that he first had in Italy so while we were visiting LA, we thought we\\'d give this location a try. It probably goes without saying that parking is a challenge. Inside, the place is trendy, very \"LA\" - not sure how to describe that vibe. Initially, our table was very dim, but we asked for a light to be brought over.The food overall was yummy. Solid pizza, I loved the mushroom tortellini, and the pumpkin panna cotta was good too. I think the pizza was authentic, the crust was fantastic. However, one of our pizzas was missing the toppings on an entire half (see photo). For its price, I expected more.Update after the business response: We did bring up the sloppy pizza to our waitress. She laughed and joked about it, like \"what was the kitchen doing with that one?\" Honestly, I was dining with family so it wasn\\'t a big deal for us to pick up the tomatoes and spread the cheese around more evenly. But it doesn\\'t change the fact that this was an unprofessional presentation. And I don\\'t appreciate the business owner assuming we didn\\'t bring it up then and there. We did. Nothing was done to address the issue.', \"One of the best pizzas in LA! Absolutely everything on their menu is delicious! Their appetizers, salads and sides, you can't go wrong with anything you order here! The restaurant is beautiful, ideal for date, night, special occasions, or simple lunch with friends!service is exceptional, very friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient! You can see the pizzas being made, and the care they put into each and every one of their products. High-quality ingredients, make it worth the splurge, highly recommended!\", \"Ambiance 5/5The ambiance of this place is wonderful! You wouldn't think such a place can be found in such a gritty area of Hollywood but lo and behold such a place does exist and is tucked away nicely and transports you into another realm when you pass the gates and into the restaurant.  My friend and I came by here for lunch and I was impressed with the atmosphere and can only imagine how much more impressive it would be when it's evening time.Food 5/5Wood fired pizza in and of itself can't be beat but wood fired pizza like the ones they have here are on a whole other level! Wonderful flavor and texture! My friend and I decided on the Diavola and added burrata cheese as an extra. If you just look the photo of the pizza, you can tell that they are strict about keeping an eye on the pizza during the entire time it's in the oven because of how evenly cooked it is. Just a note, if you're not a fan of pizza with a thin crust, you may find you'll have a change of heart after having their pizza.We also had their Linguine Pescatora. It may sound harsh but I wish I ordered another pizza instead because this dish was not on the same level as their pizza and really missed the mark. The flavor of the sauce was good, nothing special, but the shrimp, clam, calamari and mussel were a bit over cooked and were on the chewy/rubbery side. Maybe this was an off day but I don't think I would take a chance with the pasta the next time I have a meal here. Service 2/5This is the only category that really missed the mark. Our server was not very enthusiastic or friendly. It felt like she was mildly disinterested at best. I don't really ask for much when getting service at a restaurant but a warm smile goes a long way and saying THANK YOU when bringing the bill can put a cherry on top. All this woman did was take our order, pass by once to see how the food was all with a forced smile. At the end of the meal, she placed the bill on the table and walked away without saying a word. Maybe she was having a bad day? All I can say is the guy who brought the food to our table, cleared our table and brought the box for the leftover was much friendlier and made us feel appreciated as customers. Looking back on it now, since I paid my bill with cash, I should have given him most of the tip. I'm hoping they all split it evenly but I have a feeling our server is going to keep most of it for herself. In conclusion, the pizza was delicious and the dining atmosphere was wonderful even with the tepid service. Regardless, I would definitely come back again to do a dinner there!\", 'No Fees', \"L'antica Pizzeria da Michele is a true Italian gem nestled in the heart of Los Angeles. From the moment you step in, the aroma of authentic pizza fills the air. Let's talk about their Margherita pizza; it's not just good, it's exceptional! In fact, it stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the revered pizzas from Bestia and Desano. The balance of flavors, the freshness of ingredients, and the perfect crust make it an absolute delight.Now, the Chicken Scaloppina - an absolute winner. The chicken is tender, cooked to perfection, and the lemony sauce is a burst of flavors that's hard to forget. The recommended pairing with the Menabrea La Bionda beer enhances the experience to another level.And then there's the Tortino Al Cioccolato - a true decadent delight. Each bite feels like a taste of heaven, and when accompanied by a scoop of vanilla ice cream, it's simply sublime.What adds to the experience is the charming ambience. If you're lucky enough to snag a spot outside near the pizza table, you'll have a front-row seat to the mesmerizing dance of the talented chefs crafting these delicious pizzas.Plus, for convenience, they offer valet parking, making it hassle-free to visit. However, street parking is also available nearby, giving you options based on your preference.L'antica Pizzeria da Michele isn't just a meal; it's an experience. An authentic slice of Italy right in Los Angeles. Highly recommended for anyone seeking an exquisite taste of Italy's culinary finesse.\", \"Service here seems rushed.Street and valet parking available.Ambiance is very LA, different from their Naples location.The food was good overall.My biggest ding is the pesto pizza you can see all the toppings slid towards one side. Not very professional in the execution.The pizza crust has more of a burnt taste than the Italian version.It's good and I crave Italian pizza once in awhile. But not sure I'll frequent.\", 'I\\'ve never been so excited about pizza. I\\'m not the biggest pizza fan but me & my fiancé couldn\\'t stop talking about how tasty the pizza here is. Now I can\\'t wait to try the other ones on the menu. We ordered the classic margherita pizza with prosciutto, and everything from the sauce to the crust was.. *chefs kiss* we were both like, \"I wanna become one with this pizza\" lol. We also ordered their cacio e pepe (cheese & pepper pasta). Super simple yet also tasty. I loved the firmness (yet chewy enough) of the pasta.We sat in the secret garden with our server Drew. It was a bit more quiet outside but we honestly didn\\'t mind it since we were able to hear each other talk. The ambiance of the inside was lively and fun though, but I would choose to sit outside if you want a more intimate dinner. Our server was sweet and friendly, and he\\'s from TX like us! We\\'ll be regulars here so hopefully we\\'ll get to try almost every item on the menu :)', 'Came here on a Friday Night - parking is pretty much only valet or your parking on in not so nice areas and walking. The food was pretty good - the Brussels sprouts were bomb! Not pictured was the pesto pasta and the lemon chicken (I forgot the name). Both entrees were pretty good. Chicken 5/5 and pesto pasta 4/5. I got the alpine spritz as my drink and the \"alpine\" part was some what over powering, it really tasted like I was drinking an alpine tree. Not for me but the name / description of drink does match the taste so I can knock it. Ambiance is very cute and staff was friendly.', \"Heard this place had great pizza so decided to check it out.Meatballs: the meatballs were small and okay. But the sauce here is the true hero.Neapolitan pizza: the crust was phenomenal as was the toppings. With that said, this may be controversial but the core of the pizza was paperrrrr thin. It made it watery and had the toppings sliding off of it to and fro.Cacio e pepe: was told this is best with truffles but the truffles were slightly overpowering. The pasta was cooked perfectly and it was delicious just wish we would have gotten it without truffles.Nice date night location. Intimate, a tad loud, but definitely cool.There's indoor seating, a bar, and two patios. Service was fast and friendly.They have valet parking but also didn't have problem with street just had to walk a few blocks. There's a parking garage near it but it has odd hours so didn't risk it.\", \"My family and I had a wonderful last dinner in LA at L'Antica pizzeria, which was conveniently located in Hollywood very close to our hotel. The surrounding area isn't very nice, so I recommend driving there, though there is street parking if you search around for it. They also have valet, but it was quite expensive at $14. The restaurant is very beautiful, with beautiful outdoor dining and string lights, as well as very nice indoor dining. It is great for a romantic date night, or a celebration. One thing I really liked about this restaurant was that the noise level wasn't too loud, but it was a quiet buzz in the background, so you didn't feel like it was too quiet. The food was incredible! We ordered the Bianca pizza, diavola pizza, and Pappadelle Genovese pasta. All were exceptional! I had no idea the pizza would be as large as it was! It was a large size pizza with eight slices, easily enough for two people. Each pizza was around $24 to $34. The pasta was outstanding and we gobbled it up quickly. They served us gelato with a candle as we were celebrating a birthday, which was a very nice touch! Overall, I would love to eat here again and it was one of the best pasta experiences I've ever had. 5/5, totally recommend!\", \"I came here to celebrate a friend's birthday that lives nearby. I'll start by mentioning the pizza here is phenomenal, 5/5 would come here just for the pizza over everything! Amazing service, beautiful ambiance (particularly the patio area), and strong drinks too. It is a little pricey for the quantity of food (but it is going for a high-end Italian angle), you definitely leave feeling full though. Below is the breakdown per dish:5/5 - Margarita Pizza: simple, super thin, pure unadulterated classic Italian pizza, a must order if you're coming here. ($22)5/5 - Roasted Cauliflower: super creamy, VERY tasty! Literally this and the pizza are the best items on the menu by far! ($20)4/5 - Tagliatelle Pesto: solid pesto and earthy flavors, a decent size although it doesn't initially feel like it. Not an amazing pasta, but pretty good. ($27)4/5 - Pappardelle Genovese: a hearty pasta that is well made. Once again, good quality, but nothing exceptional. ($32)5/5 - Lemon Tart: the perfect (small) lemony treat to hit the sweet and tangy flavor palette. ($16)5/5 - Carrot Cake Slice: wow, such a delicious and sugar forward piece of one of my favorite desserts. Loved everything about this except maybe the price. ($22)4/5 - Drinks: a couple different drinks, all were decently made and strong, so that was good!Food: 4.5/5Service: 5/5Ambiance: 4.5/5Value: 3.5/5Overall: 4.33/5\", \"I stopped by this place for a friends birthday and was delighted with the food and experience. Haven't been working in Hollywood for a while but was happy to stop by a familiar place for our friends birthday. The place looked real nice, with some tables even having touch lights. The parking is going to be $12  valet across the street unless you can find some street parking. There are certain places if you are lucky for free street parking after a certain time. FoodI was able to try multiple different appetizers and food, but one thing for certain, their Pizza, no matter which one we tried was really good. All of their craft drinks like old fashioned seem to be the same price. The short rib pasta I had was good, I just wished I remembered the names, unless you speak the language, going to be hard to remember. Bit far for me for pizza but I think it is a good spot to hang out with friends or bring a date. Until next time !\", 'My friend asked if we wanted to grab some pizza after a show, and then directed us here. I was expecting a casual slice shop, but this is definitely more of a special occasion place. Additionally, it\\'s the world famous Da Michele from Naples, which serves the best Neopolitan pizza in the world and was featured in the movie Eat Pray Love. Talk about an understatement from my pal.This location offers a beautiful atmosphere and excellent service and is open late. We ordered pizza and pasta on our recent visit. They use fior di latte rather than the usual buffalo mozzarella for a different authentic pizza experience. Also, the pies are humongous, if you compare by American standards -- their sizes are more on par with the large sizes that you get when you\\'re in Italy. The wood fired crust here is perfection -- so delicately thin and yet not soggy in the middle. Perfectly chewy edges and as close as it gets to eating pizza in Naples.The pasta is housemade and comes in a nice generous portion, which I didn\\'t expect. We also tried salad (generous portions!) and dessert.We\\'re so lucky to have L\\'Antica right here in LA/Hollywood. I can\\'t wait to go back and have more authentic Neopolitan pizza.Parking: only valet is available on site at the restaurant. Do NOT park in the structure across the street that has a \"public parking\" sign. Even though it looks OK, they lock it up without warning after a certain hour and it\\'s impossible to get your car out. You can see that many people make this mistake as there are signs of fence/gate break-ins. There are many phone numbers you can try but no one will be able to help you. If you find yourself in this bad situation with your car locked up, the only thing you can do is hope that one of the restaurant workers parked their car in there and is coming off shift but you might have to wait late into the night for this to happen.', \"LAPDM is Da place!It took five tries eating at LAPDM to snap me out and push me to write a much deserved review. I guess I just needed to try more dishes and confirm that LAPDM is as legit as they come.My apologies for keeping this jewel to myself for this long. A place that is a neighbor to the Catalina Bar & Grill has to be respected and looked at as a true contender for the best pizza in LA and possibly some of the best pasta in LA!LAPDM has been consistently great with the service, good and ambience.I would recommend the following: Fools Gold Drink, Grill Octopus, Beet Salad, Diavola Pizza, TAGLIATELLE BOLOGNESE and for dessert: FRITTELLE DI FRANKIE.However, I'm sure that anything and everything on the menu would be greatly appreciated and fully satisfying.Very few restaurants have consistently been as exciting and fresh as LAPDM.Bon Appetit!\", 'No Fees']\n",

      "Reviews: [\"This is my second review on Granville in Weho and this place never ceases to amaze me. Our server Sebastian served us Sunday brunch on the patio and he was absolutely amazing and attentive. So polite and friendly. There were 3 of us seated. We had the smoked salmon and rye crisps, eggs in purgatory (shakshuka), and the Granville salad with added sliced medium cooked steak. All was excellent but my favorite was the smoke salmon dish. I actually had my husband do take out on that and avocado toast when I got sick the following week and it was exactly what the doctor ordered. My girlfriend had the California Love and the Hibiscus rose which was absolutely delicious but I'm a whisky lady and I prefer hot alcoholic beverages (like hot totties) So I asked for bourbon neat with green tea on the side and then after the meal had an Irish coffee. I am a caffeine addict and do not like weak flavored stuff. I like my coffee strong, so strong that it'll show up on a drug test strong. Granville has the good sh*t. So I've been at this location a few times now and I've not had a bad experience yet. Call me a regular now. I also want to do a shoutout to Katie our dinner server and to the dinner kitchen staff, a few weeks prior, Katie recommended to me and my husband to get the pork chop and ahi tuna entree. We were there to get a super quick bite before a special event and she prioritized our meal to come out quicker than normal. We had to be in and out within 45 mins and we were lucky that it was early in the evening and the restaurant was not too busy yet. We licked our plates clean and had time to spare for a quick coffee. I just love how the whole staff looks out for one another and several of her co workers checked in on us. Honestly I would be here everyday if parking was a bit easier. Since it's right across from the hospital, neighborhood and meter parking can be difficult if you don't want to valet.\", \"Not great, not bad, just ok. I wouldn't come back.Our waiter asked if it was our first time there and gave us menu recommendations when we said yes. We ordered things which were all from her recommendations.Grilled cheese dippers - These were decent. Came with 4 pieces which added up to about 1 sandwich and a small cup of soup. I've had much better, it wasn't my favorite. If you don't like caramelized onions, steer clear of this - I feel like that flavor was very apparent in the grilled cheese.Thick-cut pork chop - She said this was probably the most popular item on the menu. I will say it was the juiciest pork chop I've probably ever had. It was a nice thick piece of meat and the char added a nice flavor. The cranberry-mango compote added a nice sweetness, but I think the pork chop could've had more flavor overall.Angel hair - This was also decent. It had a very light sauce (white wine clam sauce). I don't have much to say about this one to be honest, it wasn't that memorable.Flourless chocolate cake - This was pretty good, but again, I've had better. I didn't find myself NEEDING to go back for another bite. It would be better with vanilla ice cream, not sure whether or not that's an option.This restaurant is very cute and our waiter was very friendly. It's honestly what I would expect from a pretty LA restaurant - very well decorated and a lovely place to visit with friends, but mid food. Nothing that great!\", 'I came here for my birthday lunch, and it was a great spot for the whole family. There is so much seating, and a variety of seating at that. The menu is also super extensive and flexible. My family and I chose to sit outside since it was a nice day. I ordered the santa barbara chicken sandwich. This was just an upscaled version of my weekly panini, but it was tasty. I had that with sweet potato fries, which were also really good. My family got spicy pasta, village wagyu burger, and spicy chicken plate. They all enjoyed their meal as well. One note is that only the pasta was piping hot, all of the rest of the food seemed just warm. Not the biggest issue but just something to note. The service was also fast and nice.', \"Granville had an eat and drink week so my friends and I met there to indulge in a 3 course meal for a set price. The food was good BUT the server was swamped and the service was not the greatest. My friends and I originally ordered 3 soups but the soup that me and another person ordered was not available. So we swapped to the Macaroni and cheese as our starter and my other friend ordered the Tomato Bisque. You would think that these items would be already made. Especially the soup, NOPE. We received our starters AFTER our meals. The vanilla craft soda was really delightful. The salmon was really good as well as the Mac and cheese once received. The dessert, flourless chocolate cake, was really nice.Parking sucks BUT if you park on the other side of the block, there's ample metered parking. And the place is a beautiful location.\", \"Came in for brunch on Saturday morning. No issues getting a table and service was fast! Plenty of metered parking down the street. Food was amazing. The potatoes and sausage in the village breakfast were delicious. The French toast was also so good! Can't wait to come back for lunch/dinner.\", \"Food and service were pretty good and there wasn't much of a wait when we came with a party of 8. We celebrated a birthday and had brunch + drinks here and it was a fun time! From what I remember, the server we had was nice and very attentive to us. The restaurant is very clean and modern inside, with a lot of light coming in through the windows and ceiling so there's nice natural lighting. I believe there is valet parking available, but we just found street parking on the side street of the restaurant. We ordered a lot of different appetizers and entrees and their portions are pretty big even when you're sharing!\", 'Service - 5/5 (server was Jake)Ambiance - 5/5Food - 4/5Had an 8:30pm Friday reservation for a party of 11 and was seated immediately. Jake was our server and took excellent care of our boisterous family (provided recommendations, joked with us, attentive).This restaurant is ideal for big parties because you are seated in your own area. Spicy chicken pasta - creamy farfalle pasta with a kick. Would order again. Rainbow trout with green beans - star of the show for me. Cooked to perfection and seasoned just right.', 'Granville is a nice restaurant located on the edge of Beverly Hills and Weho. We went there for brunch, they have street parking as valet. The ambiance is casual and the sun shining through the ceiling gives it a nice touch.For brunch they have brunch as well as lunch menu available. For appetizers we ordered the lettuce cups and heirloom burrata. The lettuce cups are amazing, very fresh and good. The heirloom burrata was alright. For entree I had their skirt steak and eggs. The steak was good but the potatoes came out a little dry and under seasoned. Drinks and service was great overall. The host was really sweet.', 'I thought the the menu and website vibe looked pretty good, so we decided to try this for lunch. It\\'s located on a nice corner in West Hollywood right near the Beverly Center. They\\'ve got some nice out door sidewalk seating for your dog and it\\'s all open to the street when the weather is good, which is most of the time in this part of the world.Our server was friendly enough but seemed like he was highly stimulated with i don\\'t know what, but he was talking a mile a minute and it was a bit intense. Just like \"too much information, please slow down.\" In any case he got the job done and didn\\'t hang around too much. He was just way too intense though friendly enough.I had the piri piri chicken lunch plate, which was good but the piri piri  had no heat/depth and could be improved on. The slaw and mashed potatoes were good. I also had a side of brussel sprouts with currants and toasted almonds in a delicious vinaigrette-I think this was the best part of the meal. My companion had a burger-they wouldn\\'t cook it rare, so medium rare was the request, but it came out much closer to medium/well instead of rare. Finally, we had the flourless chocolate cake which was neither here nor there-not bad but not exciting. It was served with I think port cherries, good because they\\'re not too sweet, and a pool of creme fraiche, which is a good match for a chocolate dessert.At the end of the meal our high intensity server somehow managed to forget to add in the coffee and cappuccino. When we mentioned the overdone burger, he said so sorry, and I\\'m gonna comp you the coffees, let me know next time please please, so no charge for those, which was at least a good touch. While the food was pretty good and service was friendly enough, it\\'s not really anything special or great, nor bad in any way. Just middle of the road, not too expensive for the area, and decent. I would not rush back, but if I were in the area and looking for a place to eat that\\'s reasonably good and I\\'m not being too picky, I would go.', 'We enjoyed our visit to Granville. We were able to secure street parking close by. I had the chicken soup with a matzo ball. It was tasty. My entree was the vegetarian lettuce wrap. It was delicious.  The sauce added a sweet and tangy touch. The burgers god raved reviews as did the steak sandwich. Service was good', 'No Fees', \"The food was fine and the ambiance was nice. Our server was the bartender and he was kind enough but a bit too busy to focus on our refills and checking in.I ordered the salad with add on veggie chicken. It came out to $23, which I would call very over priced for the portion size. The taste was good but it was a small salad and the $6 add on protein was super bland without much thought given to its preparation.My husband got the Caesar salad with an $8 salmon add on. He enjoyed it but, again, it was small.I don't think our waters were ever refilled. I can understand being busy but I probably wouldn't revisit simply because of the unwarranted high prices.\", \"The food here it's always spot on. This particular place is quite sexy with this openness and light that comes into the room.  Not every room it's like that but they do have a section that is very beautiful if you come here for the daytime.  Like every location, you are seated when  all your party is there. The wait time is not as extensive it feels here than in Pasadena.  Food wise had the pasta and salad and there was nothing to complain about because I always end up finishing it and wishing I had more. The portions are just right and of course I wish just more!Certainly a service here is very friendly. It could be the people the vibe and the energy. If you like talking it seems like every waitress and server here will talk to you. Love it.\", 'Pleasant location, quick service.The food was tasty, well prepared and fresh. Loved it', \"These five stars are for the food, service, and ambiance. First off, I love how this location allows reservations unlike the one in Pasadena. Secondly the customer service was off the chain. I know there are plenty of snooty customers here daily, I witnessed many while dining here. But that's not what we are here for lol our waitress Charis M and manager Celine were exceptional. This was the first time my friends and I dined here for brunch and we will definitely be coming back. From the drink recommendations to the food everything was delicious and tasteful, It was a group of six of us and we all enjoyed a variety of items on the menu. I will say the grilled cheese dipper and skirt steaks were highlights of the dishes,The cucumber martini was phenomenal , lemon drops were also delicious! Overall our experience here was a really good one thanks to Charis and Celine please continue to hire wonderful employees like these ladies!\", \"Sunday brunch! The pancakes and bacon were delicious. The wagyu tacos weren't my favorite. But everything else was top notch including the lemonade.\", \"Stopped here while visiting LA and it was amazing!! We were able to get a reservation on a Saturday  for party of 10 and due to traffic we were 30 mins late. The hostess and staff were SUPER accommodating and understanding and we were able to get in without issues. We tried a few apps and ahi, spicy pasta, steak and angel hair pastas. Others at the table tried a few other things but I didn't get a photo. Everything was amazing and the portions were huge. Our server Ken was GREAT!! We had so much fun with him and he gave us great recommendations. I'd absolutely visit this place again just to see Ken lol\", \"Stopped by Granville for Happy Hour (3-6pm on weekdays). Happy Hour is at the bar only. I was pleased that they have some bar stools with back support. There's also an option to sit at the high top tables around the bar if you want.  We got the taco trio with plant based chicken, the mac and cheese with plant based chicken, and the butter lettuce cups. I split a picante pineapple margarita with another diner in our party.Granville's happy hour has lots of vegan and vegetarian options. We enjoyed everything we ordered. Prices are very good. This happy hour is great for solo dining as well as small groups. They do not offer free wifi. We found parking on the street but there is also valet in the back.\", \"We've been to many of the Granville locations. We've had great experiences. This one in WeHo was just ok. We were there for 40 minutes. And I eat slow!  The food was great, it came out really fast. Really fast! I had the steak sandwich with chips. The husb had the beef stroganoff. Both dishes were tasty.\", \"I went here for dinner on a Friday night, and I was able to make a same-day reservation for 2 at 8:45 pm which was super convenient. I've only ever been here for brunch, so I was excited to try their dinner menu, and it did not disappoint.We ordered the grilled cheese dipper to start which was delicious, and the caramelized onion inside was a nice touch. The tomato bisque was flavorful and paired well. For entrees, we got the angel hair pasta and the peri-peri half chicken. The pasta had an awesome balance of flavors and I could not stop eating it. The chicken had great flavor too and wasn't all that spicy as advertised. The broccolini was seasoned perfectly and the mashed potatoes were creamy and tasty.Overall, the portion size was great for relatively reasonable LA prices. We ended up taking boxes home because there was so much food. The restaurant itself is a very cool space. It looks different during the daytime and nighttime so I would recommend going both times because it gives a different vibe. I would definitely go back for dinner and brunch, and I recommend this as a good spot to catch up with friends or for date night.\", \"Ive driven by this restaurant often and decided to stop in . Spacious seating, bright and comfortable ambiance. I ordered a burger w fried onions which came on brioche and small side of mac & cheese. The burger was quality meat, though a bit greasy for the onions. It was flavorful and sufficient in size and cooked as requested. The mac & cheese was out of sight, the best I've ever had eating out. It was cheesy, crunchy topping, full of flavor. Next time I'll order a large portion for the main course. The service waiter was attentive. Overall this is a place to eat for lunch w family or friends. Simple good basic food.\", 'No Fees']\n",

      "Reviews: [\"My favorite restaurant in Hollywood! It's so perfect for solo dates and the Owner and his family offer great service! I love Running Goose\", 'Running Goose is a hoot! Me and my kids wanted a good spot to eat with great quality. One of my kids is vegetarian so it can be hard to find good options of him, but their vindaloo was delicious. These were the appetizers we got baked Brie and potatoes and they were scrumptious!  A bit pricey but worth it for the quality and portions.', \"We found this place on yelp after searching dog-friendly eating establishments. I love bringing my fur baby everywhere, so that alone is an instant win in my book. We arrived a little after 1 PM on a Saturday. It wasn't too crowded and the noise level was perfect. The restaurant is situated near a busy street so you will hear cars and passerbys occasionally. I loved how quaint and relaxed the space is. We sat outdoors on the patio and instantly felt at ease.  Soft lights twinkle overhead, strung along the canopy while bossa nova music plays gently in the background. An abundance of plants and trees are strewn throughout the space. It felt like a nice weekend reprieve. The service is very prompt and attentive. Waters and wine refills were also quick and the appetizers and courses were timed perfectly!Now on to the food! We tried one of the daily specials which was the roasted carrots with carrot aioli and it was fantastic. There was a nice crispy texture and crunch to the carrots and the middle is soft tender and moist. They tasted almost caramelized and it was so so good! I am not one for ordering vegetables as appetizers so I was pleasantly surprised.I ordered the duck confit and was not disappointed. The duck skin was crispy and well-seasoned and the meat was tender. The sweet potato and broccolini were seasoned wonderfully. The wine reduction was slightly tart which was a perfect offset to the sweetness of the vegetables. For the portion size and quality, I felt as though the price was really affordable. I am used to paying a lot more duck so this sold me. I could see how this dish is one of the most highly rated on the menu! My date had the salmon fettuccine which was rich, decadent, and creamy. I didn't get to take a picture because guys like to inhale their food) The portion of salmon, pasta, and vegetables was also very generous! Since dessert has its own stomach compartment, we ordered the coconut pudding. It had a nice hint of coconut with a strong caramel flavor, and a hint of nuttiness from the sesame garnished on top. A perfect blend of flavors. I loved how chewy and moist the bread pudding was. It was very reminiscent of butter mochi desserts from Hawaii. Overall, amazing food and ambiance. I left a happy customer and will be returning to try more of their dishes again soon!\", 'Lovely and helpful staff and fantastic food. The Short Rib is stunning. We also took a few other dishes to try something new and overestimated ourselves a bit. 1 portion of soup can feed 2 people, and the pork for 2 is more like for 3.Anyway, great evening and would recommend it. And btw the menu is huge so everyone can sth to taste it.', 'My friend had her birthday dinner at Running Goose and it was AMAZING. I was the first person there because punctuality is important for me and apparently I needed to get with the program lol.Howeverrrrr, I would presume it was the owner, a slender man. But he was so gracious and open and already knew of the reservation. He inquired if we would want to sit inside or outside on the patio. Well, since it was only me to make this TOUGH decision, lol, I chose outside... YOLO.Running Goose was perfect. The staff was kind. I ordered the Smoked Beet Quesadilla and that was very unique. I would have never even imagine a beet quesadilla and it was interesting. I was not mad at it. I would have LOVED chicken in it BUT it was still good lol. They have a fire pit to sit next to and enjoy your meal as well. It was perfect. They can accommodate large parties. It IS in Hollywood so parking is tricky.', \"A peaceful hidden gem in an otherwise bustling area of Hollywood. The chef is very thoughtful about his dishes and the service is remarkable. I loved the white sangria. I'll definitely be back! Food: 10/10 Drinks: 10/10 Affordable: 6/10 Atmosphere: 9/10 Vegan-friendly: 7/10\", \"I ordered the Duck Confit Kak'ik and the Lamb Tagine which was okay. Both dishes looked wonderful. I also ordered a glass of red sangria. I think my favorite part about this restaurant is the outdoor seating and the service. Overall, nice ambiance.\", \"We had eaten at the Goose once before the Van Gogh exhibit. Our party of 4 were headed to the Vampire Circus show at the Mantalaban Theatre on Vine St. The Goose is short walk from there. There are many interesting storefronts on the walk to the Goose from our parking spot. Being in the heart of Hollywood it's no surprise there was a definite aroma in the air, not tobacco. The Goose specializes in Latin flair in their cuisine. The main eating area is a cozy covered patio to the side of the entrance. Our orders included 3 Gringo Burgers and an order of Moroccan style lamb.  The lamb was deemed excellent and the Gringo Burgers were also excellent. The Goose has a good burger choice. The ambience of the Goose is vibrant on show nights and the staff are eager to please. Give it a try if you venture into Hollywood.\", \"This is one of my favorite places I've tried in LA when looking for a place to eat lunch in Hollywood area.The corn tostada ($4) had this burnt corn aioli that was smoky and delicious. The tomato tostada ($4) was intimidating since it had so much queso fresco, but it perfectly contrasted the charred heirloom tomato jam. I definitely recommend trying the tostadas because they are so unique in flavor!As mains, we had the chilaquiles ($18), which was slightly on the saltier side, but had very tender short rib. I liked it better than typical chilaquiles with a lot of chips overpowering the dish. The real winner was the vegan pesto vindaloo ($20) though -- it had such great flavor, texture, and exactly what I want all my vegetables to taste like. I'd definitely come here again to try more of their dishes :)\", \"This week I was lured into Running Goose by their baked brie (thanks fellow Yelpers!) but they've now made a future repeat customer out of me. I had delivery this week and was happy everything arrived safe & sound. I started with coffee and it came hot & ready to go down the hatch.Their tostadas were so bomb! The carrot tostada had so much fresh, shredded carrot piled high sprinkled with herbs and queso fresco. Then the Corn Tostada had burnt corn aioli, lime, parsley and basil. Both are huge wins and I'm already craving them again. And just $4!? Yessss, please!The baked brie was a huge hunk o' cheese topped with apricot compote, roasted pepitas, roasted garlic, and sage, plus served with some toast pieces for $17. Don't get me wrong, I like the pepitas but those little things are so annoying getting stuck up in my teeth like they're corn on the cob! lol! Not holding it against them I had to floss after eating this and it was great. Cheese and fruit is a failproof method of creating a great dish but they've done it perfectly here classing it up with a lesser used fruit and accompaniments.I've become a big fan and can't wait to try more off their menu~!\", 'No Fees', 'A gem just off Hollywood Blvd. Looking for a dinner place before hitting the Pantages Theatre, the Running Goose was a perfect choice. It turned out that the valet parking proved to be a whole evening bargain compared to area-prizes otherwise. Most importantly, however, the place was very cute, the staff knowledgeable and attentive, and the food just perfect. Light, fresh, tasty and excellent to share.', \"Visited this restaurant based off of a recommendation on Instagram, and needless to say had a very mixed experience. First, the service was very good. The staff was very nice and helpful when describing the menu and some of the more popular items. Secondly, the food was delicious. My friends and I each enjoyed our plates as we ordered everything from the calamari to the chilaquiles and steak.  The short rib in the chilaquiles was super tender and flavorful and I could've eaten bowls of it the remainder of the day. The biggest issue we had while dining was simply the flies that were around due to a lot of the live plants from the environment of the restaurant. So that was a bit of a nuisance when dining and trying to fight off the gnats a little bit during the earlier hours of brunch.Unsure if that's a normal experience, but aside from that definitely recommend the cuisine here.\", \"Running Goose is the best. Their food is absolutely amazing, and their service is spectacular! Narine went above and beyond for us! Such a romantic ambiance in their outdoor patio in the evening. I would highly recommend visiting and ordering their Alfredo, it was the best I've ever tried. I will 100% be returning. Thank you guys for being the best!\", \"A fun, eclectic menu in an adorable patio setting; I love when Hollywood isn't always mega-glam. The menu is definitely fun and a little pretentious, but in a good way. It explored many interesting flavor combinations, and most were very successful. Baked brie was 5/5 exceptional; the housemade apricot compote pairs wonderfully with the cheesy, gooey brie.The soup of the day was a spicy orange gazpacho which was also a 5/5---I think it was basil-y &/ cantaloupe-y? Super refreshing, and perfect for the season.What was really interesting was the Vegan Pesto Vindaloo (4/5) --- what a concept right? While the flavors were excellent and warm and spicy, the dish itself felt a little half-baked and confusing. I wasn't sure it was meant to be consumed in the medium it was presented in, and it felt a little unfinished. That said, I enjoyed the tapas/appetizers enough to definitely keep Running Goose on my radar and return to explore a menu that I expect to change soon.\", \"We decided to have dinner before attending our Mamma Mia musical at the Pantages. It's definitely a nice walk. Lots of restaurants to choose from in the area. Great ambiance, great service. Delicious food\", 'I want to say the nicest things about this place because the waiter was so genuinely happy and kind to us. But the food was just not on point in my opinion. I love the vibe. I love the service. I wanted to love the food too! Will be back again though to try a different item on the menu.', \"Second time I'm here, and the dishes are as good as if not better than last time. Consistency and quality is the name of the game here.The bun on the burger toasted just right, with the flavor of the grill coming through strong on the patty, the burger being the right size to not be obnoxiously hard to eat but also be a mouthful of flavor. I'm not sure if the farm vegetables are different seasonally, but the carrots they used for this dish were awesome, and the crisp on it along with the seasoning, could definitely go for a whole bowl of this if I could.\", \"I highly recommend getting the duck confit. Delicious tender duck, which pairs really well with the carrot purée which is incredibly flavorful without being too much. The lamb chops were delicious with the sauces to pair with. The short rib dish, French onion soup, and chocolate dessert were definitely not bad, but aren't the type of dishes I would get again. Service was attentive and nice and the outdoor ambience was cute. You can tell the owner (or manager?) cares a lot about how the food comes out. And it's a nice little getaway from the hustle and bustle from Hollywood even though you're smack dab in the area.\", 'VEGAN REVIEW Had dinner here before at the Pantages (east walk).There are not a ton of vegan options, but this place would prob be great for vegetarians (lots of cheese). Had the beet quinoa salad as my starter (hold the cheese) & vegan pesto vindaloo as my main. Both were ok, nothing to write home about. The vindaloo is oddly served with 2 small pieces of sourdough bread,  no rice. Seemed like frozen peas & carrots? Service was good. We sat on the patio, which was nice.', 'Ok so the salt cod churros aren\\'t exactly the most photogenic appetizers but they are absolutely delectable. I drive all the way from Orange County to indulge in these umami treats every once in a while. The way the waiter confirms the order: \"salty, fishy, savory, earthy\" is so smart, on point and begins to excite the taste buds before the snack is even delivered. If any street art fans out there are reading, these would have made for an amazing concessions at Banksy\\'s Dismaland in place of the sweet dessert churro but not in a negative way, just pure trickery.I crave this confusing crispy concoction constantly and have to recommend it to my fellow advanced-pallet wielding foodie friends. Don\\'t knock it, just eat it. Trust me. I dub thee the five star fish stick lol', 'No Fees']\n",

I think it's a good sign for any restaurant that A) has employees working there long term and B) they can recognize customers like myself who only visit every few months. Friendly staff all around, makes the parking situation worth the effort. The pasta primavera is divine. The lemon donut is next level. 10/10\", \"The food is absolutely delicious, ambiance is cute and prices are great! Perfect spot for date night or even a birthday celebration dinner. Service is always friendly and there's also a great bar across the street for after dinner drinks!\", \"Been here 3x now and I am still coming back. It's the PERFECT italian spot. Most Italian places are real fast food type or super boujie ( have no flavor) but this is the perfect in between! The ambiance is still very nice for a date night but also welcome for a dinner with friends as well! They renovated and the aesthetic is modern Tuscan like! This is one of the spots where the food is just as good as the ambiance!! I LOVE THE PASTAS! I've had 4 of them and I'm constantly conflicted when I go back with what I want! It's fresh and packed with flavor!!! Amazing sauce to pasta proportions and the pasta is cooked to perfection! This place is truly underrated. I could literally be a spokesperson for this place with the Amount of ppl I have brought here and helped them rediscover it or find their go to Italian spot. And the service is always so attentive. Also the pricing for this place beats any Italian restaurant in LA based on the quality portions and service. The perfect price for the healthy portion, packed with fresh and good quality ingredients! The pesto fettuccine : is SO FLAVORFUL! Has a perfect pesto flavor with a creamy texture and hint of sundries tomato tang which is so well balanced! The texture of the pasta is outstanding and I could eat this everyday!!  Rigatoni vodka: STAR OF THE SHOW! This dish is not you're typical vodka sauce pasta it has soooo much more  flavor you can taste the garlic with tomato and creamy sauce texture is such a delight. The rigatoni is also perfect with the consistency of the sauce! The truffle ravioli: such a well balanced plate the truffle was not over powering but went really well with the light sauce! If you want a good ravioli this one is it! The portion was very healthy too we had to pack it!! The cacio de Pepe: AMAZING flavor! I loved the texture of the pasta and it's a dish you can't get bored of it's simple but so satisfying you just want to keep eating it! You can't go wrong with it as a safe dish if you want to have a simple plate.\", 'An absolute gem that deserves every ounce of praise. My experience was nothing short of exceptional! from The moment we stepped in, we were greeted by a friendly hostess. There was no wait, we were seated immediately. The ambiance was a perfect blend of cozy and vibrant vibes.Their waffles were perfectly crisp on the outside and fluffy inside. They offer a variety of toppings, but i opted to keep it simple. The pineapple mimosas were a delightful twist, refreshing and had the perfect balance of juice and champagne.What truly sets this place apart is its staff. Our waitress was nothing short but Attentive, friendly, and quick, ensuring a seamless dining experience. She was full of personality and enthusiasm. From their scrumptious food to the delightful beverages, and their fantastic team with impeccable customer service  it was an overall delectable brunch.', \"Finally tried the last of the trifecta of the She/He restaurants on La Brea. The She/He trifecta (not an official label) are a series of three restaurants owned by a lovable power couple and they are all pretty much next door to each other-- Met her at the a (brunch and lunch spot), Her Thai (specializing in street Thai food) and Met Him at a Bar (Italian pasta).The restaurant is a corner restaurant, right across the way from Met her at a Bar. The ambiance is cozy enough for friends to catch up as well as romantic enough for a casual date.The food absolutely delicious. My friend had the Uncle Vinny's Branzino - breaded  branzino with a tomato and quinoa salad. The fish filet was light and flaky with the flavor being fresh and citrusy. The quinoa salad's taste was also refreshing and plays really well with the fish. I ordered the Lobster Spaghettone and I melted in my seat after the first bite. The sauce was creamy but did not over power the dish as some dishes I do. They were generous with the lobster as well! I would definitely order this !The calamari here is great with a light batter. The meatball app is also good but very filling. In fact, we were pretty full from the apps alone!Our server was friendly and charming. He was very knowledgeable of wine and helped us paired a nice white chardonnay with our meal. Met Him at a Bar is certainly a gem that can easily land on people's favorite spots to eat.\", \"I am a huge fan of breakfast @ Met Her At A Bar, so I was very excited to try Met Him for dinner for my first time. I am happy to report that I was not let down, it was a terrific dinner. We had 7PM Saturday reservations and were able to be seated right when we arrived slightly early for our reservation. Parking in the area can be a bit tricky because the neighborhoods on both sides of La Brea require permits to park and there are limited metered spots on La Brea. The easiest thing to do is to park in the parking garage attached to Lassen's, next to All Seasons Brewing. Met Him is designed well on the inside, it's bright and open and not cramped at all. I appreciated the space in between tables, too many places cram people in so that it's hard to get in/out of the table plus hard to have a private conversation. Our server was very polite and prompt, she did a great job.You can add truffles to any dish for $20! A wonderful option that we certainly took advantage of for our dinner. We started off with the Heirloom Tomato Salad, which was wonderful and fresh. The dressing was so good I ate it with a spoon after the veggies were gone. Next came the Steamed Clams, which has been a favorite dish of mine since childhood, so it was great to have their version. The size isn't too large, and would be easy to finish for one person. For our entrees we chose two pastas and added truffles to both. We ordered the Truffle Cacio e Pepe and a special for the evening: Lobster Spaghettone with Truffles. Both were absolutely delicious and we easily finished both. The truffles were a great addition and I would recommend adding for any truffle fanOverall a fabulous casual Italian dinner in a fun part of town. It's a bit expensive, but not overly. I would confidently recommend to anyone looking for a great Italian dinner. This location is especially nice for a date or dinner with friends/family.\", 'Very cute dinner spot and bar! My brother and I came here after work for a small bite. We shared the rigatoni vodka, heirloom tomato salad, spa drink (cocktail), and tiramisu for dessert. We felt the portions could be a bit bigger for the price but otherwise everything was delicious. Service was amazing. We sat at the bar and everyone was so generous with their service making sure we were good.', 'Came here for brunch with some friends, instead of met him at a bar. Menu was pretty similar per the waiters as they are sister restaurants. Friendly service, food was ok/decent for brunch, super cute inside decoration. Loved the open space/light in the decor.', \"We came on a weekend evening and luckily were able to snag a spot without a reservation. It gets very busy at peak hours, and it's a little loud fyi if you're sensitive to that. We shared the arancini appetizer, rigatoni vodka with 2 added meatballs, and truffle ravioli. The arancini comes with 1 big ball so plan ahead to share. The food was great and the service was nice too. It wasn't the best Italian I've ever had, but definitely a good spot if you're in the area.\", 'Went for DineLA week and it was delicious! Glad we made reservations because it got super busy at like 8pm on a Saturday with a line around the corner. Service was great, everyone was helpful and quick. I had the calamari, rigatoni vodka, and tiramisu. The calamari and tiramisu were good, but I would return soley for the rigatoni vodka. Definitely one of the best pastas I ever had. Pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was soo good. Cute date spot. Parking was terrible as expected, we did valet for convenience which was $14 with cash, more if by card.', 'No Fees', \"It's alright, nothing to write home about.Made a reservation via Resy. Unfortunately, we were late and ran 5 mins over the 15 min grace period so they cancelled our reservation, which is fair. Ambience/vibe and service wasn't too welcoming or warm either. We were seated at the bar and someone came to check in 10-15 mins later. We asked about having the dine LA menu to go because we weren't hungry at that hour but still wanted to try it but they refused so we ordered it for dine in. They refused to get it all at once and wanted to course it out painfully.Drinks were ok, nothing spectacular or what you'd expect for a restaurant with bar culture in the title/mission. Even the bar seating isn't comfortable, without backrest and while this isn't a point of contention, it doesn't align with their whole idea that little wonderful things are supposed to start at bar.\", \"I've been hearing amazing things about this place for a while. I decided to try it out and ordered delivery from there.I was happy to see gluten free pasta options on their menu. I ordered the garlic shrimp appetizer, it was delicious, and a generous por. I also got the bolognese and asked for gluten free pasta. It was a big underwhelming, it wasn't bad at all but was a bit plain, and the portion size was on the smaller side.\", \"Fantastic pasta and appetizers. Got the Bruschetta and Fried Calamari as apps which were both delicious. For pastas, we ordered the Rigatoni Vodka, Squid Ink Frutti Di Mare, and the Truffle Cacio E Pepe. Out of the three, I'd say the Cacio E Pepe was my favorite.The service was attentive enough. They would come in and out to check up on us, but sometimes they'd be nowhere to be seen. That might be because we were seated outside, though.The place is small and cute. Would recommend for any occasion, GNO or date night! Definitely would come back.\", \"My party of three came to MHAAB for brunch on Saturday.  As a side note, they serve similar breakfast items at the breakfast location Met Her at a Bar.  Him has a much larger interior so this is a great choice of the line at Her is too long.The food was fantastic.  We had a Chicken and Waffle, Mama's Omelette, and a breakfast burrito.  We rounded it out with coffee and orange juice.  It all tasted delicious and came out hot.We arrived right at opening time of 10 AM and it was relatively empty.  By 11 AM it was packed, so earlier will favor larger or hungrier parties.\", 'One word: wow! From the moment we checked in, we were greeted with a smile, and of the utmost politeness. Our waiter was the best! This was my girlfriends and I first time here and he was so patient with us: from the drinks, to the appetizers, entree, and dessert, he never once gave off a vibe of impatience, or rudeness, instead, he gave us his patience, and honest answers when it came to our questions of the menu. Favorite drink: paid time off Appetizer: Zuppa di mussels, calamari- their sauce was amazingggg Entree: truffle ravioli Dessert: flourless chocolate cake. Everything is made in house, and everything was delicious. Definitely, definitely will be back.', 'Decided to dine here spontaneously before hitting up All Season Brewing and was happily pleased! We came on a Monday night around 7pm and were seated right away. They have valet parking available or there are streets nearby (watch out for the signs posted on some). The ambiance was super cute, but not too fancy. You could definitely dress nice casual or casual. Food was also delicious! The calamari was nicely portioned and crispy (8.5/10), meatball sandwich with side salad was delightful and super filling (8/10), and vodka pasta was great (7/10). Pricing is pretty standard LA prices (~$20/dish). Staff was super nice and service was quick. Overall would definitely come back!', \"Went on a Saturday at 5PM. My friend made a reservation for 3 about a week in advance. We got seated quickly and was immediately greeted by our server. We ordered the truffle fries and Brussel sprouts for appetizers and took some time to look over the menu for drinks and entrees. The truffle fries were delicious and fresh, brussel sprouts crispy and flavorful. We ordered drinks and entrees at the same time. We actually got our entrees before we got our drinks, which was a little odd since the place wasn't that busy. For drinks, I got their orange wine and my friends got a guava margarita (not on the menu) and the flower power. I enjoyed my orange wine and my friend enjoyed her margarita. The flower power was definitely a different taste. For entrees we got the rigatoni vodka with a meatball, truffle ravioli with sausage and bolognese with a meatball. We all enjoyed our food. I was hesitant to order the ravioli because they usually come with 5 at most Italian restaurants, but it came with a good amount! I added sausage because there's no meat in the dish usually. It paired well together and I'd get it again. The truffle taste wasn't overpowering and I was full after. My friends enjoyed their pastas. The bolognese with the meatball was a little too much meat for my friend, which could be a good thing since they gave a lot in the sauce.Overall a solid place, service could be a little quicker but we enjoyed!\", \"Great pasta. The food leaves nothing to be desired. It's classy, flavorful, and doesn't take itself too seriously. The service was quick and efficient. I loved the atmosphere as well. You'll pay a bit of a premium, but in my opinion the meal was worth every penny.\", \"What a great little spot! Adorable restaurant with good food and fantastic service! We came for happy hour and can't wait to come back again for dinner! Try the meatballs! It's delicious. Parking would be my biggest complaint. Make sure to read the signs if you park in the neighborhood.\", \"My new date spot! I've always heart about this place but hasn't had a chance to go and wow was I missing out. I went on a Monday night and the place was buzzing. I love a great energy in a restaurant and that's what this place had. Food was amazing and will definitely be in my rotation. Service was a little spotty at times, but it did seem VERY busy when we came, so won't hold too much against them. The dim lights also made it a great date spot in my opinion. Can't wait to go back\", 'No Fees']\n",

      "Reviews: [\"Came here for dinner on a Sunday night. I love the decor and ambiance here! My group tried the ceviches, potato taquitos, and carne asada ribeye. Everything was well made and plated nicely. I also got the Gypsy Fever, which was strong but tasty.Service was a bit slow at times, but the staff made up for it by serving complimentary drinks and an extra dessert.Parking is difficult in this area. I recommend carpooling for valet.The food here is a bit overpriced, but the ambiance and service are a nice touch. It's definitely a nice place to go to for a special event or when you want to dress up a bit.\", \"10/10Ambience: the location is actually a little hidden, there's no restaurant sign showing you where it is just some lush greenery. However it also adds to the magic of the ambience it literally feels like you've just stepped into Tulum! The restaurant and bar are all tropical and jungle aesthetic. It's pretty much all outdoors so there's no AC although they do have heatersFood: the short-ribs were out of this world 100/10. Flavorful, uniquely spiced, incredible and I can't wait to have them again! The ceviche was also fantastic as was the fundido but not as impressive as the short ribs. The chicken and guac were good but nothing to write home about compared to other items in the menuService: the service was fantastic, waiter was efficient, attentive, knowledgeable, fantastic!\", \"Food 2/5. Spent $200 for short rips, fish, and fondue including tips and I must say not worth the money. Fondue with chips was the best one out of three. Short ribs were dry and not seasoned well. Made the whole dish not delicious. Fish dish tasted healthy but since there was not a lot of lights at night, it was hard to see the dish itself that it made us hard to pick out the fish bones. The dish was $66 and you think they wouldn't include the bones for the customers' convenience.The heater there was broken in front of us so it was the combination of coldness, bad food, and money being thrown away. I gave 3/5 because the ambiance was good for the date night. Service was 3/5, our server was friendly but he came to check on us 3 times because he was covering a lot of tables by himself on a Thursday night.  Overall, if you just want to drink, it's a good place to go, but if you want to eat? I do not recommend.\", \"This place is so fun for a girls night out! We went on a Friday, and fire breathers were performing. There aren't many vegan options, but the Mushroom Birria is outstanding! The mezcal drinks are also out of this world. Food: 9/10 Drinks: 10/10 Affordable: 2/10 Atmosphere: 10/10 Vegan-friendly: 5/10\", \"I've passed by this place so many times on my way to mama shelter that I finally said it's time to check it out for my friends birthday.  We went for the cocktails so this review is strictly for that.  To my pleasant surprise we had a blast!!! We came on a Saturday night and walked right upto the bar.  There was no waiting at all which is a plus since we didn't have reservations.  The bartender was very attentive and welcoming.  We both loved our drinks!  The vibe is totally tulum with green plants and beige decor.  As we were sippin on our drinks there was a free fire show that we got to enjoy too!  We would have stayed longer if it wasn't for the rain.  I'll definitely be coming back here.\", \"Hearing so much about Ka'teen, my wife and I finally decided to check it out. Instead of Dinner, we went for Brunch and it definitely was a more mellow vibe.Parking there is such a pain so we elected to do valet which was $20. It was conveniently located by the entrance of the restaurant which is a hotel.The service was great, our waiter broke down the entire menu for us which made it easy for us to order. Since it was brunch, the restaurant wasn't really packed and so it didn't feel busy. The drinks were ok but the stand out dish was the campechana ceviche. We love seafood so this was recommended by our waiter. It's served in coconut and really sold the notion we were no longer in LA but in Mexico on vacation eating fresh ceviche.\", \"It's like being transported to Tulum so you are definitely feeling the vacation vibes but just in the middle of Hollywood.   The entire restaurant is outdoors nestled within between a couple buildings.  The service was impeccable and the food was top notch.  Had the potato taquitos, campechana ceviche, camarones ala Diablo and the short rib.  The flavors from every dish were 5 star and the presentation elevated each dish.   We even enjoyed a cocktail or two and watched a beautiful fire dancer entertain the guests.\", \"This restaurant is absolutely beautiful. Believe the reviews were it tells you it gives tulum vibes. I recently went on a Saturday evening for a friends birthday dinner and it was definitely an experience. Great food, drinks, and entertainment. Our server Monique was attentive, patient and very informative about each dish as this was our first time there. I'm only giving four stars because I do believe it is overpriced :( but I'm starting to see that as a trend here in LA. For a party of 6 the bill was over $800 w/ gratuity, taxes and their HLA fee. We all had about one drink each, our own dish and shared 2 appetizers so I thought this was a bit pricey. I would love to come back during the day time and grab brunch.\", \"Wow I have no words! This place was amazing. Food was amazing, I have no complaints. And although prices were a bit steep, it was worth it! Don't get coffee here though, I'm sure their agua frescas good. The service was phenomenal, shout out to our very attentive servers!The vibes were immaculate and honestly can pass as semi casual. I would definitely come back, maybe a staycation at the hotel.We very much recommend the flan pancakes!!!!! And their tortillas!Tommie Hotel valet is $20 or street parking. Don't mistake it to Mama Shelter valet.\", \"Super fun and not super expensive restaurant. My partner and I came for dinner to celebrate our anniversary and it happens to be on Día de Muertos. There was a fire dancer who normally is around on the weekend. Such a lovely touch to dinner entertainment. We started with the STRIPED BASS CEVICHE, and QUESO FUNDIDO. I thought queso lacked a bit of flavor, would have liked a bit of spice to it, but still a nice dish. For our main we had the LAMB SHANK BARBACOA & a side of the CORN ESQUITE. Food was delicious, service was slow to start, but I think that really had to do with the server having too many tables to manage. It ended up being great once we started getting served. For dessert the restaurant comped a PANNA COTTA that was to die for! I think it's a fun experience and I'd totally go back. ENJOY! PS: Restaurant is inside a hotel and valet is available for $20. We got lucky and got meter parking right before 8 pm when the meters go off.\", \"We started my sister birthday weekend by booking a room at the Tommi hollywood by the Hyatt. We decided  to make a reservations at the restaurant below called Ka'teen. When walking outside on a warm October night.  LA Ka'teen felt like a tropical warm vacation destination. We started out with beautiful cocktails! I Did ordered the 52 $ El Jefe west colada (Perdon tequila, coconut, lime, cinnamon wuth birthday sparkler) and I had a Casentino cocktail cilantro, and Serranos pepper infused grey goose vodka , mezcal piloncillo syrup and charred pineapple. Since there was three of us, we decided to order three appetizers; seafood, ceviche, corn, and the queso dip and then share an Entree of enchiladas the perfect amount of food. Next time I would like to try the steak or short ribs! Last, but not least since we dined on a Saturday, we were able to see the amazing fire dancing!\", 'Made reservations to stop in for lunch as they first opened. The entire place is an awesome outdoor oasis of greenery and tables. They have a great cocktail menu of summer drinks to help get away from the LA heat. The food is amazing. The Creme Brulee pancakes are an epic sweet treat, while the Chilaquiles have the perfect blend of savory with fried eggs on top. The coconut chi pudding overloads the senses.Prices are actually very reasonable for being in the Hollywood area and the service was top notch. If your staying at the Thompson or Tommie hotels you are also able to put the bill on your hotel room.Great place worth checking out while in the area.', \"From the moment you walk in, you're transported to Tulum! Great location, wonderful background music, good food and drinks! Such a summer vibe! Our server was attentive and wonderful! He always made sure we had everything we needed and brought us any additional items we requested in a timely manner. Went for brunch and ordered the following: Picture items : chilaquiles. Off the chart delish! 5/5! I definitely recommend this dish!!Avocado toast: another hit! 5/5 I would recommend Chia seed pudding: not the biggest fan of the pudding. I think it's more an acquired taste Chicken salad: not pictured. Another hit! 5/5! For parking:  valet with your car at the hotel.\", 'The ambiance is simply breath taking. Service went beyond my expectations. The Classic Margarete was okay, but the potatoes taquitos was absolutely delicious. Bursting with flavor with a spicy finish. The guacamole was well prepared. A complementary Flam Cheese Cake rich present along with birthday wishes. It was creamy and rich. The main dishes was enough for two and the presentation was beautiful. The chief explained the best way to cut the quesadilla with patience and pleasantly. Will visit revisit.', 'Extremely extremely overpriced.Difficult to park Lovely atmosphere and service.Potatoes Braves and egg quesadilla were tasty.Probably would not return because of the expensive prices.', \"Stopped by for dinner before catching a show at the Pantages. Loved the outdoor dining atmosphere and everything was delicious! To start, we got the Ka'teen Margarita (+ the $4 floater I'm forgetting the name of, which gives its that purple coloring) & the old fashioned which came with a ceded topper to keep in the smoke. Chips, guacamole & salsa were fresh and paired great with everything. Then we got the potato taquitos & short rib - yummmmm! The short rib was especially tasty and perfect for sharing. It wasn't too busy (we went on a Wednesday) and the wait staff was super friendly & fast. We made it to the Pantages with enough time to grab a drink before the show.\", \"Love love love Love the Tulum/Bali vibe, amazing music  and ambience. Love the Mexican American Fusion menu. Being vegetarian with an egg allergy, we had enough options to dig in. Food is flavor full. Love love the habenero sauce on the side. Set our pallet on fire and made us enjoy every morsel. Totally our kinda food!!! Love love the generous portions. For $$ the quantities are generous. I hate it when restaurants are stingy with food. Love Love Love AUBRY our server. It feels good when the server really wants you to have a good time and enjoy all the flavors and cares about the food and drinks you may want and enjoy. Good looking and even better hospitality. Love love love the Churos. We relished every bite. Just two side notes. Ka'teen is in the hotel Tommie. No board outside to know where it is. Just a valet person outside the hotel. Second the chairs screech when you try to pull in to sit. No biggie. Just a note. Love love the place !!!\", 'Seriously great food and service. The very inexperienced host was less than accommodating. We had a reservation for 12pm and the restaurant was not full. We showed up at 11.40am prepared to wait a bit , but not to be told at 12 pm we could not be sat bc the waiter had not arrived for his shift..... so now that effects my time to eat??? The waiter who HAPPENED to be at host stand tells waiter \" put them at my station \" and immediately brings us to his table. AMAZING! Great service! Great waiter! Will only dine here with Brandon as our waiter! **see the picture to know the waiter to ask for!!He is the bomb!', \"I was here over the weekends with some friends for a get together and was quite disappointed with the service and food here. We all decided to go to this place after seeing a review from TikTok. Got a reservation through Resy two weeks prior to the designated date. When we got there, the the tunnel in the advertisement Videos on IG are no longer present. However the vibe and decoration of the interior really gives off a Tulum kinda vibe and I was absolutely loving it. It's odd but we found the appetizers to be the best tasting here and not their main entrees. We got the shrimp ceviche and guacamole with chips dip. The shrimp was slightly sautéed and not fully cook which made it the perfect ceviche entree. For the main entrees we got the Pescado  ZarandeadoGrilled Whole Fish served with salsas, charred lime and arugula. My gf boyfriend noticed that this dish was halfway cooked especially in the middle section. The Carne Asada on the other hand was way over cooked. Plus their main entree had way too much salt added to it. When we told our server the issue with the raw fish, she gave us attitude for the rest of the night. It was nice of the restaurant because they took off the fish toward our bill for the night. However with the service that was given, sadly to say but we don't think we will be dining here in the future.\", \"After months of wanting to go, I finally tried KA'TEEN for a friend's birthday dinner. Parking: it's Hollywood so expect parking to be difficult. If you're lucky, you might get a metered spot nearby. We opted for valet, which was pricey even for LA ($20). It's confusing because the valet podium actually says the name of a restaurant next door, but they do the parking for both restaurants. Ambiance/Service: we sat outside and loved feeling like we were in a tropical jungle. The staff was great about adjusting the heating lamps to our comfort. The inside looked very cute too and looked Tulum-esque. Our waitress was really on top of everything without being annoying. Drinks: we ordered the gypsy fever and the Costeñito. The Costeñito comes with a piece of burning sage on top, which makes for a good photo opportunity but actually smelled like weed ha. Also the drink got pretty sweet towards the end. If I could do it over again, I would have gotten two of the gypsy fever, which was perfect.Food: since there were 4 of us, we got to sample a good amount of the menu. Everything was delicious and nicely timed. Some standouts were the conchita pibil, the yuca frita, duck tamal, and the corn esquite. Overall we had a great experience! It's a little pricey, but perfect for a special occasion in LA.\"]\n",

We got so many plates and loved everything! Some group faves were the Mac n cheese, beet gnocchi, and chicken breast. Flavors were amaze. We did the 30$ wine deal and it was awesome! Wine was good too. The place is such a vibe we sat on the patio and it wasn't too cold tg. They were sooo quick with the food too. The bathrooms were clean and smelled delicious...lol Cannot wait to return!\", \"Okay so let me start of by saying this: place was a 10/10 for me. I sincerely loved everything! The service was chefs kiss and it's probably what made this special! The food was amazingly delicious! The ambience was trendy- very much reminded me of Tulum vibes (tropical, boho style) My girlfriends and I met around 1:30-2pm for a late brunch date. It gets very busy so I suggest reservations but walk ins are also welcome. Food - I ordered the chilaquiles, at first I was a bit skeptical when it arrived as portions are small. Taking the first bite; was like fireworks bursting out with flavors. Hands down one of the best chilaquiles I've had. It's made with salsa verde and topped with a fried egg on top. The tortilla has the right crispness and didn't have that stale texture.Drinks -  I ordered the mand a lavender drink. The lavender drink was very refreshing  and was probably my favorite. The infusing taste of the lavender had a calming effect. So good! Appetizer - we order the sprouts. I thought it was pretty good as well but nothing crazy. Service - it was pleasant! Jocelyn and Erick made our dining experience amazing. The hospitality and attentiveness made it special and it's probably the reason for its 5 stars. I definitely will be back as I look forward to trying other food items on their menu.\", \"Perfect date night spot!Bacari is a cute date night spot in Silverlake. I suggest making a reservation and using valet for ease, and sitting in the outdoor garden section for how picture-perfect it is. Hands down the best thing we are were the Bacari fries with a fried egg. The pizzas are also pretty good and there's a fair amount of vegetarian options.\", 'Such a wonderful experience dining here on a busy Sunday. Even though every seat was taken in the restaurant the staff were professional, friendly and very efficient. They answered our questions and treated us like they appreciated our business. That means a lot to me. They have valet parking and street parking can be very difficult. I found a spot on the street three blocks away which was okay because we experienced the local vibes. Our group of six thoroughly enjoyed our meal choices. I had the lamb hummus. Our birthday guest had the free-range egg pizza with bacon which he gobbled up in pure enjoyment.Their IPA\\'s are good. I got the \"Chavez\" which was flavorful and went well with the meal. This restaurant is a significant drive from our home but it was well worth it. Not a single negative in our dining experience and we\\'ll be back.', \"Couldn't find parking on the streets so we paid for valet parking. The restaurant inside was extremely dark for some reason, I had to use my phone flash to read the menu. But I guess that's for the cool intimate ambience.The food all took extremely long up arrive but good thing we had the patience that night. The best was the lamb hummus, it's a must! Unfortunately all the portions were really small, especially the pasta. The two pizzas we ordered were good, with a thin crust. I'd skip the fried chicken sliders and the Asian pear and Brie salad.\", 'My Thank you Thursday Review goes to Bacari in Silverlake. I\\'ve been here three times and loved it every time. The outside vibes are so cute and it\\'s the perfect date spot. I took two different dates here, and they loved the ambiance. Another Yelper mentioned how Bacari looks like an \"Adult Treehouse,\" which perfectly describes this spot. Due to how popular it gets here, I recommend making a reservation through OpenTable via their website. I love the shareable plate style of eating here. Everything is served on small plates for the table, and there are many options to choose from. Here are some of the ones that I tried- Mac & Cheese: 5/5 My favorite dish here; be sure to add bacon to it- Glazed Pork Belly: 5/5 sweet and tender; recommend ordering two of them- Brussel Sprouts: 4/5 They have a sweet sauce and are delicious, but you get tired of them- Chipotle Chicken Wings: 3/5 They were not the best; I regretted ordering them at the moment- Stuffed Mushroom: 4/5 - Bread Pudding: 3/5I can\\'t wait for my next visit to try their Asian pear and brie pizza, petit filet, Bacari burger, and Oaxacan pasta.', \"Bacari has a trendy vibe with its cool sophistication. The Friday night ambiance, heightened by the live band playing vibrant salsa tunes, was fantastic. The Argentinian singer's performance was incredible. I savored a spicy Margarita that lived up to expectations, along with delicious pizza. The tapas dishes were decent. It's a lively spot for a weekend dinner, offering a blend of eating, dancing, and great drinks.  Service is attentive. The outdoor seating area, adorned with a stunning tree, was truly impressive. Brunch is on my list for the next visit!\", \"Communication between staff could be a little better, my cousin arrived first and when they led me to the table they actually led me away from the table by accident. Confusion is probably due to high volume of people and confusing winding walkways. Our reservation was for 6:30pm, booked like four days in advanced. Staff asked my cousin if we were going to take longer than 7:45pm. I think we paid the tab and finished by around 7:55pm-ish and there was a huge crowd outside, we think they may have overbooked.Shrimp ceviche- mostly tastes like tajin but I think that's the aguachile. Shrimp was tiny, I'd say skip this dish.Scallops- three scallops for $17 pretax is a bit expensive but quite tastySea bass- the favorite of the night, corn tomato mix was deliciousGlazed pork belly- quite salty and fatty (maybe with some rice or baguette would have enjoyed more,) but my cousin said this was her favorite dishPetit filet- steak was tough for medium rare and dish was not that interestingOctopus- thought it was kinda nice, enjoyed the slaw, my cousin did not like the fig addition but I thought it was okayJim's cup (mocktail)- kinda nice but a bit expensive and not that much volumeA nice-ish experience but not a 'have to go back here again' kind of feeling for me. I think the valet parking was not too expensive, I think ballpark of $12-$15? which is nice.\", \"This restaurant is such a good place to take people from out of town. If you are able to sit outside, I would recommend it, but their inner and fully outdoor dining area is so nice. There is something on the menu for everyone and the tapas style allows you to try a bit of everything. There isn't one thing on the menu that I wouldn't recommend. It is easy to make a reservation, but I would recommend making a reservation in advance.\", \"I absolutely understand why everyone raves about their service! The staff is exceptional, knowledgeable, attentive...I can not highlight how amazing their staff is. And their manager Hannah was so hands on, checking on tables and customers. By far the best customer service I have ever had in a dining experience.Their courtyard patio area is also just magical. They nailed the ambiance with the beautiful tree in the middle and seating around on different levels. They have string lighting, candles and a fire pit...just in awe of the details. We made a reservation for a group of 4 and were seated quickly. We came before the rush as it did get packed. They have valet but you can also park at the meters. Residential is permit only so be cautious when parking. We can't get into the food yet without mentioning how great our waiter Kevin was. After greeting us, he inquired if anyone had any food allergies (talk about progressive and attentive detailing). He def guided us on a magical journey with his recommendations. In addition, I love how he placed our order. It's like we had a 3 course meal with 2-3 tapas coming out at each course. Making it enjoyable too as the food remained hot.  We loved every item we ordered 10/10!*Asian pear and brie pizza - sweet and perfect balance, a must try *Glazed pork belly - delicious sauce, we ended up ordering a baguette on the side so we can dip it into the leftover sauce*Brussel sprouts - soft and perfectly cooked, with a delicious crème on top. also dip worthy*Shawarma tacos - decent size topped with cabbage for a nice bite, comes in 3 but we were able to add an additional taco since it was 4 of us *Stuffed mushrooms - the basil, pesto and parmesan, so much flavor in that one mushroom*Fried chicken sliders -  chickent well seasoned with the perfect crisp and the aoili on the bread was incredible*Bacari fries - with an egg on top. enough said. and after all that we still ordered dessert:*bread pudding - served with ice cream*double chocolate cake - sweet and creamyWe got the 90 min all you can drink and alternated between their rosé and sangria. No complaints here either, the drinks were flowing despite it being a busy and poppin' weekday. If you got thru reading this far, just do yourself the favor and go. You will enjoy and want to go back.\", 'My friend had her birthday dinner here. It goes with out saying that parking will be awful. I did valet but the parking is not on site so they drive your vehicle a few blocks over. We were sat outside and it was beautiful but rather chilly. Luckily the heaters were turned on at our request. The drinks were good, the service was quick for how big our party was. I got the smoked mushroom pizza and Mac & cheese and was stuffed. The food is very fairly priced and easy to share.', \"Loved everything about this place. I had made reservations for my birthday for a party of 8. They gave me a glass of Prosecco while I was waiting to acknowledge my birthday. The inside of the place was beautiful and every single dish was mouthwatering. The waiters put my cake in the fridge and then had the chef cut the cake and provided candles. They really helped make it a full circle experience. The bill was also not expensive about 50$ per person, it was 8 of us and we all ordered one drink and multiple dishes that we all shared among each other. Everyone at the table was already thinking when they'll make another reservation. So happy with the experience.\", \"Favorite bacari location for vibes. Love the indoor and outdoor dining options. Feels like you're in a jungle. Make a reservation if you want a table for brunch on the weekends. The service here was not good. We got in some drinks first. The burger and chilaquiles came out quickly. Some odd reason, the french toast took an extra hour. We were sitting with all the plates cleared by then. Not sure what went wrong. Otherwise, food was standard. You get what you pay for. There is metered parking around the area. Valet is 15 to 20 dollars.Bacari burger: $10Chilaquiles: $11Chef's french toast: $10Saratoga sparkling water: $7Lemonade: $4Sparkling sangria: $10\"]\n",

      "Reviews: ['Yo, just had the most incredible brunch sesh at Great White, and I gotta spill the tea on their mind-blowing Great White Brekkie. Seriously, it\\'s the ultimate morning magic. Now, parking around these parts can be a bit of a maze, and meters are like ticking time bombs, but once you taste what Great White\\'s serving up, all those little inconveniences just fade away. Oh, and let me drop this gem--their restroom? Immaculate.Picture this: it\\'s a lazy 10 am weekend, and I roll up to Great White. If you\\'re not a parking ninja, it might test your skills. Streets are tight, parking\\'s on a timer, and sidewalks are basically catwalks. But you know what? The flavors at Great White make all those parking shenanigans worth it.So, I go for the Great White Brekkie and indulge in a cheeky bite of the tremendous burger. The Great White Brekkie is like a flavor carnival--sweet roasted tomatoes, a dance of silky eggs, crispy sourdough, and more. Every bite is a taste adventure--salty, sweet, sour, crispy, wet--full-on flavor fiesta!The real champs? A-level service, a rare goat cheese spotting, and an avocado so ripe it\\'s practically singing. Now, the bacon was doing its own thing, a bit too salty for my liking. The tremendous burger, though? Absolute fire.Hit up Great White twice, and they managed to split the bill once, but not the other time. Slightly annoying, but yo, they came through when we brought in a cake. Kept that baby chilled in their kitchen--major points.Larchmont Village, typical Sunday brunch--waited an hour with the squad, but plenty of shops around to kill time. Parking? A puzzle, especially with a farmer\\'s market in the mix. Found a metered spot, and friends hit a flat-fee lot. Patio vibes were tight, a bit cramped but chill. Service was on point, quick cleanup when my friend spilled a drink.Food was mad aesthetic, although nothing had me going \"woah.\" Smoked salmon pizza was tasty, but low-key felt like a lox bagel remix. Breakfast burrito was the real OG--basic but hitting the spot. Chickpea bowl was aight, but something was off with a weird sour vibe. Coffee? Decent, but not gonna lie, other spots in Larchmont got the upper hand.Yeah, Great White might be a bit extra on the price, but for that casual brunch flex, it\\'s got the vibe. The entrees ain\\'t breaking the flavor scale, but the whole scene? Totally worth rolling back for. Counting down the days till I\\'m back for more morning chill at Great White!', 'Great place for girls night out or a date! Friendly service, indoor and patio seating. Definitely reservation if possible - they get busy. Got their smoked salmon pizza, ceviche, and rigatoni bolognese. All really tasty, ceviche was a nice touch to freshen up our palates. Pizza was fun - creamy, good smoked salmon, crisp/chewy dough. Rigatoni took the show to though - large rigatoni size filled with delicious sauce. The sauce was not too sour/acidic. Full of flavor. Def recommend.', 'Restaurant was crowded- there was about a 45 min wait for weekend brunch.Restaurant ambiance was nice- the inside was way cuter than the outside which was super hot in the sun.Service was okay- our waitress would take really long to come check in on us.Food was great! I had the smoked salmon pizza which was very yummy', \"Leave it to Australians to create an all day cafe that is the definition of casual California cuisine. Great White is a lot of LA Stereotypes rolled into one restaurant; minimalist boho chic interior, natural biodynamic wine list, overly simple/very expensive menu. That being said, they use high quality, thoughtfully sourced ingredients, and are open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We came here for breakfast, and felt that everything was very okay. My Flat White was slightly burnt, but the drip coffee was good. Paying $22 for a single pancake may seem unhinged, but the Ricotta Hotcake was so hearty that you would need to be extremely hungry to finish it. It was super hearty in texture, and I liked the fresh berries on top. My husband's Great White Breakie featured decadent, buttery folded eggs. Apparently this is an Aussie thing, but it reminded me of a French omelette-really really good. The other components of the plate were nothing special though; it was not better than the sum of its parts. Our server was lovely, and the bathrooms were cool (albeit filthy on this particular morning). I doubt we will return.\", \"I tried to stop into their other location in Venice for dinner, but had just missed the cut off for orders, so when my friend who lived in K-Town suggested this location as a middle ground meeting spot between him & Studio City, I was in. We had about a 30 min wait 2:30ish on a Sunday, so we wandered around some of the nearby stores until I got the text that table was ready. Sitting outside was def the move, as it wasn't too hot & the trees provided plenty of shade for my pale friend. Our server was attentive enough (nothing special, but also nothing terrible). Food was fresh & flavorful. I had a salad with perfectly done medium boiled eggs. Friend had a burger cooked perfectly medium. I would go out of my way to eat here, nor would I wait hours, as it's your average California American style restaurant, but if you are near, need a meeting spot with solid food options, Great White is worth considering.\", \"TLDR: Excellent brunch restaurant, HIGHLY RECOMMEND their Great White Brekkie to start any great day of yours. Parking is possible though inconvenient in the nearby residential streets or metered parking, but the tastes served at Great White is well worth the inconvenience. (Also they have a very nice and clean restroom.)- - - - - -A 10am weekend brunch outing at Great White can be aggravating if scouting for parking isn't a natural talent of yours. Nearby streets are narrow, parking is scant and limited to two hours, and the sidewalks are equally as small, but these minor inconveniences are worth the tastes served at Great White.I ordered the Great White Brekkie and sampled a piece of my friend's Salmon Mezze. The Great White boasted a collection of sweet roasted tomatoes, surprisingly salty arugula, silky smooth folded eggs, crisp sourdough bread, and a few other items. Between all the tastes, I really enjoyed the variety of flavors, with bites of salty, sweet, sour, crisp, wet, etc. If my mouth could travel the world of flavors, it really did this morning! The highlights? Excellent service, a rarely eaten goat cheese, and an avocado so perfectly ripe that explaining with words is difficult. I was a little uneasy at the bacon which didn't look like the normal roasted bacon that I was used to. The taste was okay, though a bit too salty and not for me. My friend's salmon mezze was on the saltier side, and I am generally not a fan of smoked salmon... so I'm glad I went with the Great White Brekkie. I initially felt uneasy at the $22 price tag, but after this experience, it was well worth every dollar - and more!\", \"A typical, slightly expensive but aesthetic brunch spot in Larchmont Village. We met with some friends for brunch on Sunday and as expected, it was packed. We waited around an hour for our party of 6 at 11:30 (thankfully there were lots of shops nearby to browse & kill time).Parking was tricky since there was a farmer's market on Sundays too, but we found a metered spot & our friends parked in a lot near the entrance for a flat fee (which we'll probably do next time).  The patio is nice, although it was pretty crammed & not fully covered so it was a bit chaotic with our friend's baby & stroller. Service was decent - my friend spilled her drink and a staff member immediately came over to help us wipe it up.  Food was aesthetic, but overall nothing really wow'ed us:Smoked salmon pizza was yummy, but it was basically the same as a lox bagel with less cream; I think I expected a little more from this entree since it was one of their most popular items. Breakfast Burrito was kind of basic but good; the eggs were fluffy & flavor was balanced. A solid choice.Chickpea Bowl was just okay; something in it tasted extra sour but only in one area of it (maybe too much sauce?) and it was off-putting. I wouldn't get this again. Coffee was alright too, nothing compared to the other coffee shops in Larchmont.It's decent for a casual brunch, although the price point was a little high given the average-ness of the entrees.\", 'Avo toast slaps ok .. this is my other half that I took to go ... ran an errand came back and had it for lefties with the tator tots and the hot sauce ..: omg so good !! Yes yes and all the yess', \"Food 3.5/5 - breakfast burrito (3/5) was way too mushy, all the flavor should not been mixed but was altogether and tasted like weird breakfast congee. Chicken sandwich was crunchy and flavorful with coleslaw (4/5). But nothing too significant.Our server made our visit seem not welcomed. Don't know her name because she didn't introduce herself but she had a blonde bun updo. Ambiance 5/5 very cafe style but elevated decorations. Don't know if we will come back again.\", \"Service was good.Food was even better!!! I didn't have any expectations for the salad but it was extraordinary. It had so many fun and yummy ingredients that my friend and I got inspired to try making it at home. The salad came with pretty big portions so that was a plus.The truffle pizza was AMAZING. It wasn't too salty, it was perfectly truffle-y--it was just immaculate. I wonder if they'd consider serving the truffle pizza with honey on the side because that would be heavenly. Matcha lattes were pretty good.The ambiance is vibey & chic.TLDR; food is great, ambiance is cool & chic, good service, great place to treat your friends out on a nice brunch.\", \"What is going on everybody?! We are back with another food review. Today I met with some friends in LA for brunch at Great White. I will begin this review with parking. There is paid parking around the restaurant but if you drive down the main road into the neighborhood area there is free parking (2hr max) for certain time/day. When you arrive to the front of the restaurant you are greeted by the host where you will put in your name. Be prepared to wait at least 25-30 mins if going around brunch time on a weekend, it will be busy. Also, I would highly recommend sitting inside as we were put on one of the outside picnic benches where folks will walk past you constantly. There is very limited shaded seating if seated outside which makes it very uncomfortable if it's a hot dry sunny day in LA. The interior was very nice. A lot of neutral colors and bamboo design. We ordered a breakfast sandwich and pancake which both were ok. We also ordered a shaken iced espresso ( easy pass on this) which was alright. I would recommend going to the coffee shops down the street. Overall, great place to catch up with some friends for a bite.\", 'Great White is such a cute breakfast spot with great ambiance. The food was amazing. It was the best breakfast burrito I have ever had. The service was quick and super friendly staff.', \"This place is in Larchmont next to a ton of shops (salt and straw, jenis, levain) with street and public parking. The wait was only 20 min for us on a Sunday morning but it got way longer as lunch time approached. It was good food and the ambiance was so cute! Great White Breakfast ($22) - these eggs were beautiful  it was like a deconstructed open face sandwich, my friend said it was perfect proportions and really fresh. The eggs were good esp w the goat cheese! She said she'd go a little lighter w the avo but overall great  Iced Matcha Latte ($7.50) - this wasn't worth, tasted like watered down matcha so I would skip... my friend said latte wasn't v special either so maybe skip on drinks! Breakfast burrito ($16) - this was so yummmyyyy! Outside was crisp w tater tots and fluffy egg inside. I think it had some aioli inside that was superrr delish, a very good breakfast burrito!! Instagram - @joangela.eats\", \"Came on a gloomy Sunday brunch time, expecting to wait for a table. Was seated within 15 minutes of checking into the front desk! We got the club sandwich, pizza, and a salad. Club sandwich was yummy, my only complaint is that it came out soggy. The pizza with honey was delish. Salad was also pretty tasty. The ambiance of the place is definitely very cute. It's a good spot for brunch with friends and family.\", \"Came here for brunch with a friend! Upon arrival at 10:30 am on a Saturday, we joined the line and added our names to the waitlist using our phone number. A notification would let us know when our table was ready. The hostess estimated a wait of around 20 minutes for first-come seating, often outdoors. To our delight, her prediction was spot-on, and we found ourselves seated within the promised timeframe. Our waitress was friendly, although it did take a bit of time to receive our water and food.While I'm unsure if this establishment completely lives up to the hype - possibly due to the snug seating arrangement, the beating sun's warmth, and the overall wait - the food was good! Undeniably, the place bustles with activity, and they may benefit from more staff. On the upside, the aesthetic is truly captivating and alluring.An intriguing incentive to dine here lies in a discount they offer - spend a certain amount, and you'll receive a $5 deduction on your subsequent dine-in experience, courtesy of their app.In conclusion, though undoubtedly an appealing locale for exploration, I remain uncertain if the buildup matches the reality. As always, the best verdict comes from personal experience, so I encourage you to give it a try and form your own opinion!\", \"We came for a dinner reservation and even though it's a nice spot to bring friends and such, the food is a bit boring and quality doesn't really match the price. Seating isn't the most comfortable and tables are quite small so that it made it difficult to order more than a few dishes to try.We tried the brussel sprouts appetizer as well as the smoked salmon pizza and both were decent but missing the punch needed to set it apart from other restaurants that have the same dishes. Parking is pretty easy as the area has plenty of shops and metered parking is readily available in front.Service was good, nothing special to note. Not sure if I would visit again.\", \"I love the decor/style of this restaurant, the open architecture and the arches makes it a sort of Mediterranean feel? I can't really describe it but it definitely is cool. The staff also seem to be following this theme of white clothing per the name Great White.All very interesting and cool for Instagram, but as for the food, okay is as far as I'll go. The Brussels sprouts were tasty sure, but most of the time you really can't go with crisped and glazed Brussels sprouts. The squid was okay but felt like the batter was not as crispy as it could be. The salmon pizza was very disappointing, felt like basically eating lox but with a pizza crust instead, and didn't feel like anything was added or improved by making it a pizza.\", 'The food was so good! the salmon curry was probably one of the best ive ever had. The calamari and the very unique salmon and creme freshe pizza was also very good. The service was great and the area was great too. It was my first time in Larchmont and the feel of the place is so nice, i definitely recommend.', 'This place is always packed! Having a reservation is a must. But note that to make a reservation, you have to put down a credit card and there is a cancellation charge per person. I came for dinner this time. I do plan to come back for breakfast/brunch. I\\'d say the prices are \"LA prices\" but I think the portions were very filling for what we ordered. I got the fried chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries. The fries were meh and Luke warm. The chicken sandwich was extremely flavorful. The bun, however, could not hold the sandwich. It all fell out and I ultimately finished my sandwich with a fork and knife. My friend had the eggplant parm pizza. It was a good call getting the chili oil on the side because it definitely packed some heat. Our waitress was very nice and the food was served so quickly! There\\'s indoor and outdoor seating, although the restaurant is mostly open air. Parking on Larchmont is always a nightmare so plan accordingly.', \"Service/SettingMy group of 3 came here on a busy Sunday morning. Wait was about an hour, which is understandable. Once seated, the staff was efficient to take our order and get us our food. Good experience with the service here. The restaurant itself is visually pleasant with a modern, beachy feel. Sitting inside is recommended to take advantage of this. FoodWe had the Burger, chicken sandwhich, and breakfast burrito. All of them were delicious and generously served. This was one of the better brunches I've had in a while! Only minor area for improvement was that the buns on both sandwiches got a bit wet and flattened from the juices of the meat. Didn't stop me from happily stuffing it down. Overall:Great option for brunch in La, one of the better places I've visited in a while! Recommended!\"]\n",

Their pizza? A must-try. It's quickly become one of those places I just can't pass up. If you're looking for a spot that combines ambiance with killer eats, Beauty & Essex should be on your list. Trust me, it's worth it.https://loanlightyears.com/\", \"Cool trendy spot in Hollywood. I came here for my birthday with two other friends on a Saturday night. Although we made reservations we still had about a 30 minute wait. When we were seated the section we sat in was a little quiet compared to the rest of the restaurant you really could not hear the DJ. After a while they eventually turned up the music and it was better. For the food, we ordered everything tapas style and shared. The scallops were probably my favorite followed by the mini Grilled Cheese Dumplings. Kale and Apple Salad was really good we ordered two of them because we were really hungry.  We also got the Truffle Mac which was decent. We honestly ate a lot of food between the three of us. I would say don't bother with the cupcake dessert. We had one of them and it was a little dry. Otherwise the atmosphere and small plates were delicious. Great opportunities for photos ops!\", \"After staring at the menu of Beauty and Essex at the Cosmpolitan, my blushing bride decide that we would celebrate a special family event at Beauty and Essex in Hollywood. We highly respect Chris Santos from his demeanor and knowledge as a TV cooking show judge. It's clear that his staff reflects these virtues!The experience was actually very nice and we had a great family celebration. Nikoly helped us navigate the menu, whcih I found iniitally to be a bit daunting. His initial focus was on the apps and other one-bite dishes, each at about $5/bite. I've never added up the total number of bites my family needs to get a filling meal but it would be a lot... like a really lot! He quickly helped us formulate a plan for a family meal that included a combination of apps, main courses, and side dishes. I really respected how Nik represented both his employers interests and ours in a completely responsive and professional manner.First item were drinks, and all were really well-made. The cocktail list is interesting, innovative, yet familiar enough to not be scary. Apps were baguette and burrata, which both were fantastic. I must admit that I'm a bit uncomfortable with a 12-dollar baguette but that's not too unusual in this day and age.For dinner we shared the half chicken, scallops, potatos bravas and lobster mac&cheese. For me the clear winner was the chicken, which rivaled that experienced at Thomas Keller's Bouchon. I wasn't too thrilled by the mac& chese, though. I thought it was quite underwhelming but the family loved it so I must be wrong.  :)For dessert we saw a clear diversion of intent. I ordered a 1/2 dozen oysters and the family ordered the Wonder Wheel.  The oysters were absolutley fantastic: small, fresh, perfectly shucked, and very tasty. The variety of dessert bites on the Wonder Wheel was also quite good and the wheel itself made for a really fun experience.Only one thing that made me a bit uncomfortable and the reason why this is 4-stars rather than 5. We were seated in the booth adjacent to the kitchen door. All staff members moved silently and we barely noticed their comings and goings. Except for one gentleman waiter. I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable at the way he looked at us each and every time he passed, seemingly with a sneer. He wasnt' our waiter and I couldn't figure out why he was even looking at us and even more couldn't figure out why he seemed to have some sort of attitude. I'm trying to not take it personally but...\", \"Vegan review: I was brought here for a dinner date on a Friday evening. The entrance is through an alley with some cute mirror photo ops. The front room has the appearance of a pawn shop. Then you walk through a lobby to the bar, main dining room, and patio seating. We were seated inside the main dining room. It has a romantic upscale boujee ambiance, exactly what I had hoped for. Heads up, the lighting is very dim, though there's at least a candle at each table. Some people were dressed more casually and others nicer. I was in a long evening gown and did not feel out of place at all. When I asked the waiter about the vegan options, he brought out a separate menu for vegan dishes only, which is super awesome! It eliminated all the hassle and guesswork so I could just order and enjoy my meal without worry. The waiter told us that guests typically order a few dishes and share, so keep that in mind. Our server Omar was great and they were super on top of refilling our water. The Thai BBQ Mushroom dish was served on fried rice cakes with a broccolini slaw on the side and topped with sesame seeds. Two waiters separately told us it was their favorite vegan dish on the menu so I had to give it a try. It was very flavorful and perfect for fellow mushroom lovers. My friend rated it 8.8/10The Roasted Heirloom Carrots were served with a coconut cream. The carrots weren't hot when they arrived to the table, which didn't bother me, but just wanted to note. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I didn't know carrots could be that delicious. The cream was so good too. My omni friend tried both of the vegan dishes and enjoyed them very much too. He ordered the deep dish pizza with pepperoni. He's a harsh pizza critic, and gave this a 7.7 rating (10 being absolute perfection cooked by God himself). He also got the Woodsman cocktail and said it was damn good and they didn't skimp on the alcohol. The pricing was what you'd expect for a place like this in Hollywood. Fair for the location, service, etc. Making reservations was easy and valet parking was super close by and worth it for this area of Hollywood. Overall, perfect spot for a fancy dinner in LA. A++ service for vegans! I would definitely come back again, maybe on Sundays when they have live jazz. My friend rates it an 8.7 overall experience. Now this may sound weird, but do not skip out on a trip to the toilet! The ladies room has a glamorous pink and silver lounge where they were serving complimentary champagne. It would be such a cool spot for a little hangout and pics with the girls. I felt like I stepped into an alternate universe or movie, it was a side quest in and of itself. One more thing, as a party of two, we were placed along the wall, one seated on each side of the table. My friend on the wall was sharing couch seating with one person in the party seated beside us. This was just a bit odd and a little too close for comfort in my opinion. It was okay and didn't bother me too much but it took away from the intimacy. There was enough space that it didn't feel like we were on top of each other but enough to feel like it was encroaching on our privacy a bit. I think if they were two chairs instead of a couch it would feel less weird. I could imagine someone larger being uncomfortable.\", 'Wow.  What a great night we had!  We went for DineLA on a friday night.  The valet parking was a whopping $20, but the valet was friendly and it IS Hollywood.  Many of the patrons and the hostesses look like they are club goers.  I thought that we might be a little out of place, but no one made us feel that way.  In fact, service was TOP NOTCH on every level.  Every single employee that we interacted with was friendly.  We felt very welcome.  Amazing.  The atmosphere is excellent.  You get the Speakeasy theme right away and there are a lot of Gatsby vibes with the extensive bead decorations.  Lush...that\\'s a good word for it all.5/5 - 24oz Bone-In Ribeye:  Seasoning was EXCELLENT!  So much flavor and perfectly cooked and tender.  My new #1 steak.5/5 - Cookies & Cream:  House made chocolate chip cookie with a boozy milkshake shot.  I\\'ll take a carafe please!5/5 - Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings:  Delicate dumpling.  The flavors are delicious, but it doesn\\'t really taste like grilled cheese.  Doesn\\'t matter though...I would definitely get this again.4/5 - Berries & Cream:  Butter cake, farm fresh berries and chantilly.  A little dry, but much better with the fruit and cream.4/5 - Skirt Steak Frites:  In roasted garlic-bacon sauce and served with garlic aioli.  Some parts were excellent, but other parts of the meat were chewy.  The sauce was great.  The fries were thin and crisp, but the seasoning was a bit overwhelming in spots.4/5 - Butter Basted Scallops:  shrimp and saffron rice, peri peri sauce, crispy linguica.  Scallops were cooked perfectly.4/5 - Burlesque Show:  Traditional Old Fashioned3/5 - Woodsman:  Pear muddled Old Fashioned.  A little too sweet.3/5 - Kale & Apple Salad:  My husband enjoyed this, but I was not a fan.  Apple Cider Vinaigrette, pancetta, candied pecans, shaved goat cheese. 1/5 - Mexican Street Corn Ravioli:  The description says \"roasted pompano creme, cotija, cilantro lime butter\".  They do not mention whatever sweetener they added.  This was not corn-sweet, it was like honey-sweet.  No thank you.  I did not get the Mexican Street Corn flavor from this.  Disappointed.The food and drinks came out to 3.8 stars.  I happily round up to 4 stars for the excellence of the top dishes.  The service and atmosphere blows that up to 5 stars.  When I come back, I know how to get all 5 star food.  Looking forward to it!', 'Absolutely delighted with my experience at Beauty & Essex! Amiah, our waitress, provided top-notch service, enhancing our dining pleasure. The food was beyond incredible--every dish we ordered was a culinary delight. The atmosphere exudes sophistication, and the playlist is nothing short of amazing. I absolutely loved every aspect of Beauty & Essex, making it a solid 5-star dining destination!', \"I've been eyeing Beauty & Essex for a while. It has prime real estate on one of Hollywood's hottest blocks, and has been a staple to the scene since it opened. Now was this the best dining experience I have had? No. But I did have nice time spent with my girlfriend celebrating our anniversary. Don't get me wrong, the food is good! We had the steak frites, tuna tartare tacos, and grilled cheese soup dumplings. All of which tasted great, but aside from the surprise hit in the dumplings, I can't say this was a very memorable meal. The restaurants biggest issue is in its menu. It's just too basic. The apps are the most unique options on the menu and what stood out the most. The grilled cheese dumplings are a must have anytime you visit. Aside from that, I can't give any glowing recommendations on what to order from the mains. We kind of just kept reading and were like, is that it? While what we received tasted very appetizing, I think there's room for improvement for the restaurant in how creative they are with their entrees. The inside is a bit cheque, riding on the verge of tacky without any eye popping qualities in terms of design. It's incredibly dim, but there are some cool chandeliers that caught my eye. It draws the crowd you would expect, so at least they know who they're catering to. Beauty and Essex was fun and it's suitable destination for a one-time visit for an easy date night (at least the prices were fair!), but I would probably have my reservations in going back.\", \"Overall, I had a great experience at Beauty & Essex. The ambiance is incredible, and we happened to visit on a Sunday night when there was live jazz music, which was an amazing surprise. The food is divine, and the menu is meant to be shared. They had a nice selection of drinks, and I opted for a black tea-based mocktail to start off our meal. I think the appetizers are the real star of the show here, including the mini French dip sandwiches and grilled cheese, smoked bacon & tomato soup dumplings. It's a really unique variety of items and the 2 we tried were delicious. I also thoroughly enjoyed the steak frites as a main course. Ours came out a little rarer than we asked for, but the flavor was great and the thin fries were perfectly crispy. Finally came the desserts, which were similarly extravagant and fun.Our service was not the best. We visited early on a Sunday night so it was not that crowded, but there were times where I felt like we didn't see our server for ages. But overall it was a wonderful evening!\", \"We had visited the bar and lounge of this beautiful restaurant in Hollywood before. I really liked the strong and tasty cocktails. Of course the cocktail prices have increased drastically after pandemic. Champagne prices were not bad to my surprise. They offer impressive gluten free and vegan menus. We really liked the eclectic dishes with an Asian fusion twist. The patio seating was very relaxing and spacious with beautiful potted plants. It was jazz Sunday but the entire restaurant was kind of empty. They didn't even need to open the upstairs dining area. For food we decided on fresh oysters, Thai shrimp, Branzino, filet mignon and broccolini. The food tasted fantastic and so flavorful. The portions were on the bigger side. We loved the dessert wheel in the end and it was fun to try them all. Our drinks were very well made and tasty too. We really enjoyed our dinner with jazz music in the background. It was a lovely evening for hubby and I. Our server was so friendly and attentive, in fact all staff were very welcoming and pleasant. I was glad that Beauty & Essex didn't disappoint, Tao group is really up to their game! We will definitely be back whenever we want a special dinner in Hollywood!\", 'I recently visited this trendy spot in the heart of LA, , jewel-toned eatery with vintage decor offering New American plates, drinks & wine and it instantly won me over with its chic atmosphere and inviting outdoor patio. The veg options, including the margherita pizza, burrata, patatas bravas, and street corn ravioli, showcased a delightful blend of flavors. To top it off, I ventured into the world of zero-proof cocktails, savoring the refreshing mint lemonade and the intriguing platinum peacock, both of which exceeded my expectations. A noteworthy perk is their valet service, making the overall experience seamless. Highly recommend for a stylish and satisfying evening.', \"My husband and I had a reservation Saturday evening. We arrived at 5:45pm and we were seated at 6pm in the upstairs dining room to the right. We were the first party to be sat there. The ambiance was nice, darkly lit and romantic. Very LA fine dining vibe. More parties were seated in this dining room section and the noise definitely picked up, it was hard to hear yourself talk.Honestly, I was ready to give this restaurant 1 star and leave before ordering our food. We waited almost 25 minutes for someone to take our order. We watched 4 parties who came after us get their orders taken AND we watched them get their drinks and food delivered to their table. Not sure if they were under staffed tonight, but this was very frustrating since we had to make our showtime for the Pantages and I was worried if our food would come out in time. We made eye contact with two staff who would circle around the dining room, but they seemingly were just in charge of refilling water.My husband talked me down and finally, our waiter approached our table. My husband politely informed him that we have been waiting for a while to place our order and would have to leave soon to catch our show. Our waiter kindly apologized and he did do his best to remedy the situation.As soon as we put in our orders, I got up to use the bathroom and by the time I got back, all the food was already there on our table. They even gave us an extra complimentary dish of meatballs. This gesture and the swiftness of getting our food quickly to us was very much appreciated.We ordered:- Braised chicken meatballs 5/5: juicy, tender meat and strong flavor with creamy truffle sauce- Classic Thick Cut Filet 4.5/5: the steak on its own was very flavorful and came out perfectly medium rare, sauces were just okay- Baguette with garlic chive butter 3.75/5: bread was warm and soft with a crunchy crust; butter was creamy and easy to spread, but the taste kind of reminded me of AMC popcorn butter which isn't a bad thing- Mac and cheese with shrimp and lobster 2/5: Al dente pasta, saucy had a nice creamy consistency but there was absolutely no flavor to it; the only flavor came from the lobsterWe also ordered drinks. The Beauty Elixir was just okay, it tasted just like a glass of champagne but with a frothy consistency from the strawberry and cucumber pulp yet no hint of the fruits' flavor. My husband liked his drink though the Spicy Crush.Overall, I strongly give this restaurant 3 stars. The food borders between decent and good. I don't think it's worth its very expensive price point to warrant a second visit. Our server was kind and tried his best to make up for our situation. I just really wish the restaurant would have a better system of attending to guests once they are seated in the order they arrive.\", \"A really beautiful restaraunt, but the food fell short. Neither myself or any of the 4 people I was with enjoyed their meals. While I usually would give places a second chance, after trying 4 separate meals and not enjoying one, I think it's safe to say the food is just not good.\", \"The restaurant has a nice hip, warm vibe with music playing in the background whether you sit inside or outside. There are plenty seating options courtyard, main dining room, and bar.  The food is innovative, tasty and delicious. All the dishes are great for sharing and you can add on additional pieces to the plates. We had the Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings (a must try), Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos (a must try), Little French Dips(just ok), Lamb Chops (super tasty), Rib Eyes (just alright), Branzino fish (really good), Chocolate Peanut Butter Cake, and the 'Berries & Cream' butter cake (our favorite). We also got a side of Patatas Bravas (Baby Yukon gold, guajillo sauce) super tasty and should also be on the list to try.\", \"Location: adorable perfect for pictures mainly in the entry area it's all about the estetics! Food is yummy 9/10 my hubby likedThe steak but it was limited options and he loves tender cuts. Seafood options are good and cocktails are strong! I' would return for bday celebration but plan for small parties. The area is small and limited space when sitting. Girls night out I think is more of the vibe I got!\", \"Beautiful and fun restaurant to dine at, before a show at The Pantages. It's a quick 10-minute walk from the theater, but watch out for the many homeless encampments, along the route. Seen a dude with a knife. Entrance was a little hard to find, it's off Selma, not Cahuenga. The entrance is cool. Looks like a pawn shop, but opens into a beautiful dining area. We sat upstairs and it was still early, so it was like we had a private dining area, but eventually filled up by the time we left. We were celebrating a birthday, and I made note of that when booking the reservation, so there was a happy birthday note on the menu, upon being seated. So nice!The service was great, from entrance through the entire meal, very friendly staff. The food was delicious and cocktails were refreshing. The bread sounds simple, but it was perfectly toasted on the outside, pillowy on the inside, with a garlicky butter. Steak was perfectly cooked, but less of the sauce would be better, because it's tender and flavorful enough, so doesn't need a lot of sauce. The Japanese fries were bomb, get them! We ordered the chocolate mousse dessert and it came with an edible birthday chocolate note and candle. Cool spot, would come back and try more dishes.\", \"Fantastic!!Stand out service!  Everyone, from the door man to the busier gave superb service. The ambiance is very slick/cozy/warm. The food A++++. The chicken meatballs were out of this world. My mum loved the Tomato soup/grilled cheese. This is my first time going so I wasn't truly aware that it was like a tapas place. So, order to share and make sure to order enough if you've got a big appetite. This sort of dining is my favorite  Definitely a must go, especially if you're headed to the Pantages (about 5 blocks away. Yes we walked to the theater).\", \"I recently dined at Beauty and Essex in Los Angeles for my friends birthday and it was an absolutely stunning experience. From the moment I walked in, I was transported to a glamorous and chic world. The decor is simply stunning, with glittering chandeliers, plush velvet seating, and stylish accents everywhere you look.As for the food, it was simply amazing. The drinks were strong and enjoyable. The menu features a wide range of delicious dishes, from classic comfort food to more upscale options. Once we left, we definitely left full and satisfied. What we ate:Appetizers:Kale & Apple saladGrilled cheese & tomato soup dumplingsTuna poke wonton tacosBeauty & Essex Cheeseburger slidersEntree:Oven braised chicken meatballsRoasted salmonSides:Mac & CheeseTogarashi FriesDesserts:Berries & creamMilk shake shotsThe service was also top-notch. Our server was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu, and the rest of the staff were equally professional and helpful.Overall, I highly recommend Beauty and Essex to anyone looking for a truly special dining experience in Los Angeles. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or just looking for a night out with friends, this restaurant is sure to impress.\", 'My first visit was Mother\\'s Day 2023. Valet parking was very easy to miss, we ended up in front of the hotel and had to make another loop around the block to get into the right area. Coincidentally the \"right area\" was in the middle of the street. The guy at the valet gave us a ticket, put our keys in the car and then ran off to move other cars that arrived after us. My husband stayed back for more than 10 minutes waiting for his car to be parked. He watched as other cars were moved before his. He alerted the valet one more time about his car and was assured that the car would be safely parked. We were promptly seated at our table. Water was offered immediately. It took another 20 minutes for a server to come and he only took a drink order. It was another 20 or so minutes for the waiter, Christian, to take our food order. The appetizer course came out in a decent amount of time but our entrees took forever. We were more than 2 hours into brunch before all of the food was delivered to our table.  We kept ordering bread because we were starving, I didn\\'t realize each loaf was $12!  The chicken arepas was pretty good. I was shocked by the hot bottom part and the cold inner part. I\\'m not sure if everything was supposed to be the same temperature. I had the salmon, pretty small portion and very limited on the flavor. The server was really slow and most of the food was just ok. The ambience was cool, I\\'d love to check this place out at night when the kids aren\\'t around. I would probably enjoy my 3 hour meal much more without entertaining young ones. The prices seem a little high since the food is wasn\\'t amazing! Portions were small and I still left pretty hungry. We tried ordering additional food and drinks and decided to cancel once the 3 hour mark hit and nothing has been delivered.', \"What a great great find and let's talk about the decor... so cool. We had the tuna taco and  ravioli ... so yummy - will be back for more and try the Jazz night on Sunday as well. Did I mention the service was incredible and everyone seems happy and friendly there. Love\", \"You can't go wrong with this spot if you're trying to have a nice dinner! Not too busy on a weekday and the ambiance is great. The seafood and steak frites were absolutely amazing, nothing was underwhelming. The drinks are tasty too. Only thing that was lacking was the service, waited for about 15 minutes for the check while our server kept passing us by. Otherwise the meal is def worth trying once.\"]\n",

      "Reviews: [\"I ABSOLUTELY love this place and will continue to come back more and more because of the great food, amazing staff, and cute rooftop vibes! It's right across the street from Burke Williams where I get my monthly massage so I try to come here each month!  I have come alone, I have treated my mom here for Mother's Day, I have come for girls brunch, I have come just to get drinks, and I have come a few times with my teams at work.  You literally can come for ANY occasion and have such a great time.  I love how they label what keto, plant-based, and anti-inflammatory!  I think by now I have ordered almost everything on their menu and everything has been so delicious!  One of my favorite items is their steak tartar and I highly recommend ordering at least two because you'll always want more! The trio spread is so flavorful and a must-try!  Honestly, you can't go wrong with anything on their menu!  Their drinks are also really bomb and sometimes I go and order a bottle of wine because they have a great selection as well!  My favorite server is Sandra and I always request her when I make my reservation ahead of time online!  She's so sweet and can help out with any needs or questions that you may have and can suggest exactly what you're craving- drink-wise or food-wise! She's always so on point and I love her!  This place is such a vibe- I'll probably see you here because this is where I come the most!\", \"Celebrated my birthday at Mother Tongue and couldn't ask for a better dining experience! I made reservations on their website a few weeks in advance. I called the day before and requested for a specific table. They were accommodating. The restaurant is hard to find as it is in an alley of a hotel. The location was beautiful! I enjoyed the pink theme of Mother Tongue. For appetizers, we ordered the selection of all three spreads ($26) plus extra flatbread ($6) and two orders of lumpiang sariwa ($21). The flatbread was warm and fluffy, pairing well with the flavors of the spread. The lumpiang was very refreshing! They reminded me of spring rolls. For entrees, we ordered the squash agnolotti ($25), falafel ($27), jidori chicken ($39), roasted duck breast ($46), and roasted lamb ($85). The presentation of the food was so pretty and colorful. The roasted lamb was the best! Big portion and well seasoned lamb. We also got the Ken Wright Pinor Nior '21 ($100) and a passionfruit margarita ($14). The wine was one of our favorites recommended by our waitress! We were very impressed with their food and would come back for their brunch menu. The service here was outstanding! Erin was our waitress, and she had the most outgoing and bubbly personality. She was passionate about her job and gave us a rundown of their menu. She made my birthday experience special and was attentive. Other staff were incredibly friendly and helpful as well. Mother Tongue has the best service! They didn't give a complimentary dessert but did cut my cake and package the to go food. It's a cute restaurant for date night or to celebrate a special occasion!\", 'Like another review wrote, the food was great but not mind-blowingly amazing. But we definitely had our favs. I really enjoyed the whipped avocado flatbread. Just wish there was more avocado spread but the flatbread was perfectly chewy and baked (forgot to take a pic of this dish!). We also enjoyed the lumpiang sariwa considering we had 2 Filipinos at the table who were actually impressed with this dish. Would skip the mother tongue salad, we all agreed this was our least favorite dish. It was plain and the strawberry sauce/purée was all we could taste. Grilled oyster mushrooms were tasty as well with the curry & chickpea sauce.Apparently the striped bass is one of the more popular dishes but I thought it wasn\\'t as memorable. I don\\'t quite remember how it tasted like actually. We did enjoy the lamb dish, though. Even tho it\\'s \"for 2,\" since we shared all the appetizers, one order was plenty to share between 6 people. I\\'m so glad we ordered all the desserts because ofc we have a separate stomach for that. We all couldn\\'t stop talking about how good the panna cotta was. I could have eaten that all by myself and is definitely something I would go back for. Please keep this on the menu forever. I don\\'t remember the name of the dessert on the left in my dessert picture.. it was a cake with raspberry.. foam? The cake was actually really good but the foam was a bit off putting. I think it would have tasted better as a cream or something with jelly-like texture. Ice cream wasn\\'t anything too memorable. It just tasted like.. healthy ice cream? Would order again if I want something light to end the meal. Also forgot the name of the top dessert but it was also good! Cocktails were also good but expensive, but I guess that\\'s the average in LA *crying in TX.Service was impeccable! The hostess were welcoming and made sure we were comfortable with our choice of seating (we originally requested to be seated outside but it got windy AF). I like that they have standing heaters and also heaters overhead, but it was just way too windy to be outside (they also have blankets!). We ended up sitting inside and we enjoyed the ambiance & vibe of the restaurant. I love dining anywhere where I could actually enjoy my conversation with my company. Our server.. I\\'m SO sorry if I forgot your name or misspell it.. I think her name was Geraldine?? She was so sweet! She went over the menu thoroughly and made recommendations, and the food runners explained the dishes well too.This restaurant is actually on top of a luxury gym but the vibe from the staff didn\\'t feel snotty at all. Would definitely come back to try out more items here.One tiny complaint: valet wasn\\'t that friendly. Also they quoted $11 at first but when leaving they asked for $13 (my fiancé didn\\'t hear the first price but both me and my friend heard it, fiancé paid for valet). There were also plenty of parking spots open across the street so save yourself money and just park there instead!', 'Food was good, but nothing overly hits-your-face-amazing. The vibe and inside is really cute with a lot of great natural light. It was pretty much empty on a Saturday afternoon- and we were there from 11-2! The location has really awful parking: street (Goodluck), paid lots around the block, or valet.', 'Great evening of dinner and drinks with the family. First time dining at a Michael Mina establishment and it was a great experience. First off, the entrance is a hidden elevator entrance in an alleyway, super cool! Upon entering you will be greeted by the host and walked into their very chic dining layout. You have the option to be seated indoors or outdoors, we decided to stay inside due to the chilly weather. Service was great from start to finish, but the meals were the highlights of the evening. Huge fan of the fresh menu items that provide a unique taste to each entree. Plan a visit, thank me later.', \"I had a nice dress and wanted to go to a bougie brunch. Mother Tongue was recommended to me and I was so excited to go!The entrance is a little hidden. It's in the back alley but you'll see the sign on the wall when you get closer. If you get the first reservation of the day, you  might need to ask the gym to unlock the elevator. Ambiance is fantastic. It would be a fantastic place for a girl's brunch. Staff were very sweet from the start. I was dining alone and don't love breakfast so I chose not to go with the prix fixe menu. They also have a nonalcoholic menu but the waiter was super honest and said nothing really tasted good. Instead I asked the bartender to make me something fruity and sweet and he made me a really good passion fruit mocktail. I ended up getting the spread trio and the shitake larb. My favorite spread was the Toasted Walnut Muhammara. The pita served alongside the spread was hot and fluffy. I really enjoyed the larb as well. It was so flavorful and filling. The only thing I regret is not coming with more people so I could try more of the menu. I'm totally coming back!!!!\", \"My friends picked this restaurant to celebrate their birthdays at on a Saturday night. One of the reasons they picked this place was because of the ambiance. The restaurant has a really beautiful dining room; it looks like a room from a Wes Anderson movie. The restaurant entrance is a little hard to find, it's nondescript and around the side of the building. It's also in a hotel. We were able to get a reservation for 5 of us and didn't need to book way ahead of time. The menu here in globally influenced, hence the restaurant's name, Mother Tongue. We ordered a couple of dishes to share as appetizers, the lumpia and the strawberry and fennel salad. For my main dish, I had the mujadara, a Middle Eastern dish of caramelized onions with rice and lentils. This was my first time eating this dish and I enjoyed it a lot. The dish also had crispy onions scattered on top and smatterings of fresh parsley. My friends said their mains were good. We also shared a couple of dishes between us including the mango tapioca pudding and the soft serve matcha pudding. I liked that the desserts were light and not overly sweet. Our waitress this evening was very upbeat and enthusiastic. She was always there when we needed her and gave us great recommendations. I'd recommend trying Mother Tongue if you're looking for a nice restaurant in Hollywood. The space is large and the restaurant wasn't particularly busy.\", \"I came here to celebrate my bestfriends birthday! The restaurant is kind of hard to find because it's in an alleyway. Our Uber got lost twice haha. The place inside was super cute and very chill vibes. Service here was great! Sandra was our server and made sure we were we'll accommodated and checked up on us frequently. We ordered a wide variety of food! All the food was really delicious. I liked the steak and frites, but they only had two pieces :') the 3 spread was good and flavorful and a good add on to the other apps we got!\", \"Super cute and chill spot with great views! I went for happy hour and sat on the rooftop, adjacent to the pool. We got a couple of reasonably priced happy hour items and drinks. It's a really chic experience priced much more casually! The bartenders we super cool. The atmosphere was really laxed. I'd totally go back!\", 'This restaurant is such a hidden gem. First off, it\\'s difficult to find this place. I think I walked around the block three times. It\\'s tucked within an alleyway and there\\'s an elevator that takes you to the restaurant. It\\'s beautifully decorated in every way. You can tell they really put effort and thought into the design and little touches. Everything from the furniture to the tableware to the glasses, to the lamps on the tables, it\\'s so well executed and stylish. Very photo-worthy. Lots of seating inside and there\\'s an outdoor section as well where you get a decent view of Hollywood.My friend and I each ordered an aperol spritz, a classic.Toasted Walnut Muhummara: This dip was so comforting and delicious. A nice way to start off the meal. A savory dip served with freshly warm pita bread. Best eaten fresh, once the pita gets cold it gets tough.Shittake Mushroom Larb: This is so fun to look at, and so fun to eat. There\\'s a crunchy rice sheet over each lettuce wrap, each one is filled with mushrooms and tofu. Great combination of flavors and textures as there\\'s some lime in it too. This is a must get and it\\'s great for sharing. It gets a little messy, there will be some drippage on your hands, but it\\'s worth it.Seven-Vegetable Cous Cous: A stunning dish. A bowl with the vegetable medley comes along with a side bowl of cous cous. This was good but my least favorite out of what we ordered.Pacifico Striped Bass: This is a dish that will make you say \"wow\" when you eat it. It\\'s served in a coconut broth and there are scallop pieces included too. The fish was cooked perfectly and the flavors were wonderful.My friend and I ordered some dessert to finish off the meal...Soft Serve Sundae: This is a dairy-free soft serve ice cream with cubes of matcha cake and it\\'s topped with goji berries and bee pollen. Such a nice way to finish the meal!', 'This place is sexy. Stunning interior and delicious food! The lumpiang Sariwa changed my life. So fresh and unexpected. Our server, Adiam, was absolutely lovely and knowledgeable. Will def be returning!', \"Such a cute rooftop place to go for happy hour!! The trio dip is amazing esp the muhammara it's like sweet and savory and just so good. The whipped avocado dip is also really delicious, reminded me of the whipped eggplant from elephante but avocado version. The bread is nice and thick and fresh. The chicken tikka skewers were delicious. Nice and flavorful with the perfect amount of masala(spice). The vibe is what makes this place so special. It's such a cute rooftop with views of Hollywood and pink booths. Love it. Only reason why I remove one star is the dinner menu is unnecessarily expensive so I wouldn't stay for dinner but worth to go for happy hour!\", \"I went for Sunday brunch a couple weeks ago. I initially had a hard time finding the place because you have to enter the restaurant through valet which is accessed in the back alley. The valet attendant was very pleasant and helpful. He directed me to the restaurant from valet. Once I entered the restaurant I was taken away by how freaking cute the inside dining area is. The hostess, Karen,  greeted us at the door and sat us at our table outside. She was a total sweetheart. I ordered avo toast with the grilled jidori chicken. It was good but wished I ordered the wild salmon bowl after tasting some of my friend's. We ordered several drinks and I enjoyed them all. While we were there, two more people met us and joined us to eat and drink. Although our reservations were for three people, Karen was so nice and accommodated us with another table that sat five people. We continued to order appetizers and several more drinks. I had a good experience and will be back.\", \"What a unique place perched above a high end gym and by We work! The restaurant/bar has indoor and outdoor space to kick back and relax with a drink, appetizer or have dinner! The ambiance is sweet with its pink and green color decor! Nice long bar to curl up to as well! And a big open kitchen that's glassed in!As for food and drinks: we just had happy hour! The happy hour consist of various appetizers for 5 dollars and cocktails and wine for 10 dollars! We elected to try one of their infamous dips. The dip consist of red pepper, nuts and molasses among other things. The dip was very flavorful. The dip was accompanied by fresh pita. Good little appetizer to pair with my cocktails. I started with a mango margarita: super yummy. A little sweet. The vibe tends to be young people during happy hour. Most of them were enjoying the pool on the rooftop deck that's part of the gym not the restaurant. The gym is 300 dollars a month. The mini booths by the bar consist of mostly people working. Worth a place to visit for drinks and views! The rooftop is a perk in itself! Lastly the entrance is tricky. It's not on the Main Street but an alley behind the building. Find the elevator and take it to the fourth floor.\", \"Came here for brunch to celebrate a friend's birthday. Their brunch menu features 2 items for $39. You get a 1st and 2nd course which is a great deal. The servers were friendly and the decor in this place is awesome. It has such a retro yet modern feel and it wasn't too hot for us to enjoy the rooftop terrace. The crudo was delicious, avocado toast was standard, but we all really loved the flat bread with spreads. The spreads were phenomenal. I got the breakfast sandwich which was a solid choice. Crispy pork belly could've been crispier. Overall a great spot to grab brunch, they also do bottomless rosè!\", 'Celebrated my birthday here over the weekend. I had trouble getting reservation confirmation through their website so I tried emailing info@hellomothertongue.comResponse was quick and easy was able to reserve for a specific seat and requested for birthday dessertsOnce we got there we went through the alley way and elevator was not hard to findService was amazing 5/5Food was even better 6/5And the chef even came out to wish us a happy birthdayAll my girlfriends also commented on how great the place was after. Very successful birthday. Will be back.', \"Came here on a Saturday night with a group of friends. It was a little hard finding the place but someone on the street let us know the entrance was around the corner. I thought it would be hard to get a reservation for a prime date/time but got one just a few days prior; it made me a little apprehensive, for a hyped restaurant being surprisingly free usually meant it was mostly style and no substance.The worry dropped as soon as we got seated. The waitstaff was friendly without being overbearing, efficient but courteous. We started off with drinks and I appreciated that they had a few cocktails that were whiskey based that weren't just based on the old standbys. I went with the Strange Magic, a Japanese whiskey based cocktail and which was different and enjoyable.For starters the four of us split their house salad which had a good crunch from the coconut granola and a nice tangy sweetness from the pomegranate vinaigrette. The other starter was the tartare which three of us enjoyed, the fourth is not a fan of tartares so she didn't try it. The pine nuts was a good touch, added a little lightness to it.For mains, I ended up getting the filet which came with potatoes and a chimichurri finished with some greens on top. The dish was right sized, satisfying with the chimichurri adding a nice tang to the steak. I didn't share but I didn't manage to try the Striped Bass where the curry actually had a nice earthy element to it.Overall, our experience there was excellent and was a great night out.\", \"Great patio, lovely decor. Exceptionally attentive service without being invasive. Good wine list with lots of options in most price categories. We had some of the dips at the recommendation of the server. She was absolutely right, they were delicious! I'm a fan of appetizers to share, while the mains looked really good, there were so many different appetizers to share, you can easily make a meal of that. The famous lettuce cups were as promised, totally refreshing and highly recommended. I'd return.\", \"Excellent food that far surpassed our expectations and we also didn't know it was a rooftop so bonus points! I would have given it 5 stars but unfortunately the service was just extremely slow and they kept forgetting things that we asked for. The most of all was water that for some reason was really hard to come by and we were really unclear why. We will definitely be back and hope that the service is a bit more prompt and proactive next time to match the delicious food and ambiance\", \"Gorgeous restaurant, beautiful food. Definitely worth the trip!Went to mother tongue with my work colleagues for a team dinner, and we're very impressed when we walked in the door with how beautiful the interior an outdoor space looked.   We went up to the bar and got drinks, from very helpful, friendly bartender. When we moved the table, we had a nice outdoor view, and the weather was great. Once it started getting cold, they pulled out the external heaters, which was a very nice touch.  Service overall was great, even if it slow down towards the end of the night.In terms of food, I will list below what we got in order of how tasty it was to me. The food is definitely style over substance. It looks beautiful, it's definitely an art form, and tasted great for the most part. Definitely not large portions, so if you go with a group over 4 you should definitely order several Different plates. We had a group of six and I had about one bite on each plate, and would've been nice to know how many dishes would've been more appropriate.- Selection of all three spreads with unlimited bread. - flat iron reserve steak - Jidori chicken, tiki masala- hand cut steak tartare- grilled oyster mushrooms- shiitake mushroom Larb- DessertsI would definitely venture back for a date night, and to try the rest of the dishes we didn't sample.\"]\n",

      "Reviews: [\"I came to Olivia with my vegetarian friend and was blown away. The staff was so friendly, attentive, and so gracious. The food was amazing everything was so flavorful. We got the fried olives, jalapeño and kimchi pizza, this creamy tomato salad, the jackfruit pasta, and the focaccia. I am not the biggest fan of olives nor do I eat them ever. But wow these were the best olives I've ever eaten. They were fried and had a honey coating. The focaccia was charred which gave it a smokey flavor. My favorite thing we had was the pizza. It was so cheesy and hearty. The jalapeños and kimchi gave it a unique pairing but it worked. We got complimentary dessert. The olive cakes were the perfect size after a full meal. Thea restaurant itself is very cute. It has parking which is always a plus. I would def go here again to check out other things on the menu and to get the pizza again.\", \"My close friend and I walked into Olivia the moment the restaurant opened. It was 5pm and we had a reservation for two. We got a beautiful seat by the window and we were greeted by a wonderful waitress who explained the menu and how to place the order via QR code. So you scan the QR code, place the order on the website which shows the entire the menu, then when you want to pay you can do it then or you can wait until later. The waitress also notified me the things that had truffle oil (I'm allergic to truffle) and double checked with the kitchen that the items I ordered were truffle oil free. I love them so much for this as it made my eating experience very comfortable and more enjoyable. That being said, we got the following: - Crispy Potatoes - this came with crispy potatoes in the form of wedges, dill and this wonderful sauce - this was very delicious and it came in a big portion so it was big enough to share - Slow Roasted Tomato - this was surprisingly very big enough for two people. We each got 3 slices - it came with sage, garlic, asiago, Romano, and ricotta this was delicious and fresh out of the oven and the pizza crust! The pizza crust is (I think) made of sourdough? it tasted fresh and different compared to other pizzas I had. I ate the whole thing. - Blue berry bread pudding - this was sweet but not too sweet and the ice cream complemented this dish very well. This bread pudding had lavender coco oat milk, vanilla gelato and decorated with edible flowers. - Blackberry lemonade - this was very refreshing. it had lemon, blackberry, mint - I just wish I had the option to add a shot of tequila - Strawberry Terragon Lemonade - this had fresh strawberries and tarragon - my friend tried it and she said she loved it. Overall, I would love to come back (w/ reservation of course - this place was packed by the time we left), and try more of their dishes. Thank you.\", \"This vegetarian eatery is tucked away in a small shopping plaza. Parking is a little bit tight but we had no probably with getting a spot. We made reservation for 5:15 pm but got there right when they opened at 5 pm. Right when we walked in, we had a nice warm greeting and they were ok with us showing 15 mins early. It's a cute vibrant place for a group dinner or date. However, be warned it is small. Love the QR code menu method. We can designate if it's an individual or group order and can continue to add on until you're ready to pay (through the app). While we ordered through the app, they were very attentive to us. We started with the fried olives. This is a must. That whipped macadamia ricotta with truffle honey topped it off. We also had Crispy Chicken which were fried oyster mushroom. As an entree, we got the Kimchee & chicory vegan pizza. Good flavor, however, the pizza was slight heavy on the toppings which made the bread a little soft. Crust was super crunchy. To complement the pizza, we had the chopped kale salad. If you have a seed or nut allergy, please don't get it. Otherwise the Fuji apple and dukkah went well with the kale and the salad wasn't drenched in the coconut dressing.Before we left, we ordered the juniper Jamaica drinks and asked to split into two cups. They literally filled both cups for us. Also asked if I wanted more hot water and a to go cup for my french lemon ginger tea.  Overall, the staff were amazing and such a pleasant experience. Everything was delicious. If I was to come back to town, we would definitely be back.\", \"I was excited about this vegetarian/vegan place since I recently moved and it's near me now. However, it was really disappointing. We got the Fried Olives, Squash Blossoms, Cavatelli Bolognese Pasta, Mushroom Soy Sausage Pizza, and the Juniper Jamaica drink. The Fried Olives with truffle were absolutely delicious. The best dish I've had in a while. The drink was super refreshing too. These two items made us think we were in for the best evening ever. However, everything else was tasteless and mediocre. The pizza tasted like nothing. Everything was jush bleh and too expensive for what it was. The vegan cheese ricotta was grainy and the dishes lacked seasoning. The service was friendly and quick, but you just order from the app--you don't order from a server. The ambiance was nice. Overall, though, I would not recommend.\", \"We came here because a spot we wanted to try was closed. But now we have a new favorite wine bar, so it's a win! This place has amazing music, the cutest interior, the staff is the best & the food had us shocked at how delicious it was! Here's what we ordered  Fried Olives 16Truffle honey, Aleppo, Whipped Macadamia Ricotta Little Gem Caesar 18Toasted papitas, Brazil Nut Parmesan, BreadcrumbsAnderson Pizza 22House Made Kimchee, *gruyere, beemsler,  gouda, JalapeñoRisotto 34 I can't find this on the menu online but it was delicious. it had mushrooms, asparagus, lots of yummy veggies! Every bite got better and better.  For dessert, the restaurant gave us some chocolate mousse to try which was just added to the menu. It had fried coconut on top! DELICIOUS! A must get! The menu is full of vegan and vegetarian options! We hadn't checked the menu before coming but the waitress walked us through some of her favs. Everything on the menu sounded good so it was hard to only pick a few things lol. If you're in the area and want some wine and delicious food, come here! And get the fried olives!\", \"I went to LA for the weekend and wanted to try out a vegetarian/vegan place and this place popped up.I went Friday evening and it surprisingly wasn't that busy. The ambience is super cute and everyone was really friendly! My fiancé and I decided to get the stone fruit salad, the Anderson pizza and the Cavatelli to share. For drinks we got a melo-nana x 2. Everything was amazing and all vegetarian! The stone fruit salad has really complex flavors and the beans and fruit were really good.The Andersen pizza was also had such complex flavors with the kimchi and Gruyère cheese and nothing was overpowering. The cavatelli was also hearty and rich which my fiancé liked a lot. I wish there were more cocktail than the melo-nana but the melo-nana was fantastic. Id go back to try other things on the menu!\", 'Pros:ParkingPurse hooks under the tablesFriendly serviceDelicious olivesConsRidiculously small water cupsSalty foodFried olives was the best thing we ate. Very flavorful. The mushrooms were fried well but the gochujang sauce was too thin for something fried. The bread wasn\\'t that great but the butter definitely made up for it. We really wanted to like the pasta but it was SO salty. We were drinking shots of water with every bite. The pasta was cooked perfectly but could barely eat the \"meat\" of the sauce with it. It\\'s flavorful and good but just so salty. The Andersen pizza was salty as well and it was on the crunchy side but not sure if it has anything to do with using a special dough.We were seated at the corner couch table so I was really happy about that. I just don\\'t know if there is anything worth coming back for. Sorry. I really wanted to like this place.', 'Not a vegan or vegetarian, but enjoy good food with good drinks and good vibes. Checked all the boxes. I enjoyed all 4 dishes shared with one of my girlfriends along with our HH wine. 5 if you count dessert which we obviously have a 2nd stomach for. Fried olives were the perfect app and first intro to their macadamia ricotta. Sweet, salty, savory. Fried \"chicken\" were deliciously fried, but light lions mane mushrooms - addictive. Spatzle was a surprise winner of the night with a pesto oat cream sauce you could drink like a soup. Somehow just perfectly balanced with light plumps of spatzle. Kimchi Kale pizza smelled like umami/seaweed and soon as it hit the table. Wish it was a little more saucy but they have excellent pizza crust. Wine I had on happy hour was delish. Bread pudding dessert was a wonderfully guiltfree monkey bread of sorts with a creamy vanilla ice cream. Everything was vegan and I really enjoyed it. Nice service and friendly staff in a super cute spot in a middle of a edge-of-ktown plaza so yes, parking in the plaza was possible. QR/App ordering is on the rise and I\\'m not sure how I feel about it yet, but it was fast! Would return for another girls night or date!', \"Very generous portions and a great staff! Checked this place out for breakfast a few weeks ago. Although it was a Saturday, there wasn't much of a wait. Warning: chilaquiles with 3 sauces mean that there are going to be 3 portions of chilaquiles, each with a different sauce and can easily feed 4 people.\", \"My friends and I came here for an early dinner to catch up before a movie and we had a wonderful experience from beginning to end.There's a parking lot (total win because I hate parking in ktown)! We were greeted right away with big friendly smiles and that's honestly not that common these days for some reason. The ambiance was super cool and artsy- loved the vibe and colors- you'll love the backgrounds and decor for nice and memorable photos. We started with the olives and they were super tasty and the dish was not at all like you'd think when you imagine eating olives. The whole dish came together so well with all the components complementing each other. Whipped macadamia ricotta was delicious!!!We also got the Crispy Chicken which was made out of oyster mushrooms as a replacement for chicken. The mushrooms were super fresh. The scene stealer was the Salanova salad- it was incredibly fresh and light and again the components all came together SO well. This one is PERFECT for the summer. Finally we ended with some pizza which is having a moment in LA right now. We opted for the Anderson pizza because I convinced everyone to try kimchi on pizza . It was super super savory and who doesn't love kimchi + cheese? All in all a wonderful experience and I hope to be back soon! We didn't order any of their natural wines but they have a great selection and I'm sure they would pair very nicely with these dishes.\"]\n",

      "Reviews: [\"The Korean Fine Dining experience at Joseon is a culinary adventure that left my taste buds dancing and my senses overwhelmed with delight. The service at Joseon is impeccable. The staff is attentive and knowledgeable about the menu, and they're more than happy to guide you through your dining choices. From the moment we sat down, we were treated like royalty. Our water glasses were never empty, and dishes arrived at the perfect pace, allowing us to savor each course.The highlight of our evening was, of course, the food. Chef Debbie Lee dedication to authentic Korean flavors and their commitment to using the finest ingredients shone through in every dish. The menu is thoughtfully curated, offering a balance of traditional Korean favorites and innovative creations.\", \"My wife and I had a great dinner at Joseon with friends last weekend. We were greeted at the door immediately by the hostess and we sat in the dining room, a very clean/modern feel. Everyone at the table tried one of their house special cocktails, the one I had with bourbon was really nice and unlike anything I've had before. The rest of the cocktails and the bar looked intriguing, but that's for another night when I'm not driving home. We started off with a bone marrow appetizer that was fantastic. It was very rich and was topped with a chimichurri like sauce and served with deliciously buttery crackers. We both enjoyed the 7-course menu and we ordered different items for most courses so we were both able to share and try more of the dishes. We're both familiar with Korean food, but nothing like the elevated dishes we had here. The waiter described all of the menu options clearly and he was very patient with our questions. We enjoyed everything and we each had our own favorites. My wife's favorites were the royal dumplings and the wagyu oxtail. I tried both of those too and thought they were both delicious, but my favorites were the black cod, and the prawns. We both got the rice cake soup as the last course and it was a nice finish to the meal. Overall we really enjoyed the ambiance, the food, and drink. Parking is limited, but there's valet parking right outside the door which is very convenient. Highly recommended!\", \"Really great experience for my belated birthday :) Make a reservation on Resy. They have valet parking for $12 but if you circle the neighborhood, you can get free street parking. Just read the signs to make sure you can park there Inside is super clean and modern. The lighting is dim with some hip hop music. Service is fantastic. We picked the 7 course meal with one set of alcohol pairing. The plating and presentation is beautiful. There were some dishes I liked more than others but it was an experience to enjoy them all. I think my favorites were the crudo, cod, and dessert. The 7 course meal took about 2 hours. Food came out at a good speed. Also, they were very generous with the alcohol pairings. The 7 course meal came with 6 drinks and they were not sample size either. If you're a couple, I highly recommend to get one drink pairing and share it :) So glad I got to try this :)\", \"solid fine dining Korean restaurant. Glad they're opening more of these in LA (although sad that Kinn is closing as well). It's bold and adventurous - likely will be a challenge to please the tough Silverlake and LA crowd but the bar is cool and the interior is amazing so I wish them success.Food overall was pretty good. My favorite was the squash blossom.\", \"Really good and had some really unique items on their 7 course menu. The beverage pairings were all delicious as well.Fav was the tartare, squash blossom with tofu inside, the cod and oxtail gori jjim with the crispy rice was delicious, and the dessert was also a great end to menu. All the other courses were good but felt like it needed a somethin' somethin' more to be a banger. I wish the presentation of each course wasn't all the same, it felt pretty redundant having so many items look the same. Parking is on the streets.\", \"Joseon was the best meal I had in LA by far!! If you are visiting or a local, you should make time to visit Joseon. Whimsical, stunning, and delicious dishes by an incredibly talented chef in a beautiful restaurant. The meal was well priced for what you get - $80 for a pri fixe 5 course meal in LA. What more can you ask for? I'm so glad I was able to try Joseon while Visitng LA. We went for the 5 course tasting which was filling though we plan to try the 7 course menu next time. $40 for the drink pairing was a great deal and the plum wine and cocktails were delicious. Extra points for the incredible service and beautiful decor.\", \"Best Korean Food w/ Modern Twist by TV personality Debbie Lee (Morimoto's Sushi Master)! The presentation is beautiful with personal touch and tribute to Chef Debbie's Northern Korean roots. They use fine ingredients. The taste was amazing taste with a pop of crispy accent texture in some dishes. I love Debbie's rendition of Korean seafood. It was a night full of culinary surprise for the taste buds. Chef Debbie keeps striving for perfection in her culinary creativity. Joseon is my new Korean comfort food. 5-course menu $79. 7-course menu $99. It's a good deal. The add-ons were delicious. I highly recommend the 7-course menu and add-ons. Come with more people so you can try everything. Reservations are made via Resy. Valet $12 or very limited street parking (read signs). I am excited for their extension. Can't wait to come back again!\", 'In the gastronomic panorama of Los Angeles, where upscale Korean culinary representation has been surprisingly muted considering its substantial Korean populace, Chef Debbie Lee\\'s \"Joseon\" emerges as a beacon of modern Korean fine dining, a tour de force in an arena where LA has, until now, played second fiddle to the culinary juggernaut of New York City.\"Joseon\" is a contemporary ode to the regal fare of Korea\\'s Joseon Dynasty, an era when culinary artistry was as revered as the royal bloodline itself. Chef Debbie, in a stroke of brilliance, orchestrates an experience that intertwines history with haute cuisine. The menu, a tantalizing array of 5 and 7 course tasting odysseys, many with alternate \"A and B\" routes, promises a bespoke journey for every palate.Among the culinary pageant, one finds dishes like the Bossam, a masterclass in flavor, the Shila Oysters Rockefeller, and a Bone Marrow dish that could easily be crowned the monarch of the meal. My personal sojourn through the 7-course menu was nothing short of a royal procession: from the humble beginnings of Juk (Porridge) to the crescendo of Wagyu Oxtail stew, each dish was a narrative in itself. The Beef Tartare, accompanied by a seaweed cracker, was a symphony of umami that set the taste buds alight with anticipation.And just when one thinks the crescendo has peaked, the Deconstructed Asian Napoleon dessert arrives, not so much a dish as an explosive finale in this culinary opera.Yet, the experience at \"Joseon\" transcends mere food. The optional drink pairings are an educational voyage in themselves, dismantling the stereotype that Korean cuisine is best accompanied solely by beer or Soju. From cocktails to wine, plum liquor, and makgeolli, each beverage is a chapter that complements the unfolding story of the meal.\"Joseon\" is not merely a destination for aficionados of Korean cuisine; it is a revelation for the uninitiated, an elegant introduction to the complexities and delights of Korean fare. And with the promise of a new bar menu, including a burger that dares to challenge the gastronomic elite, and a possible vegan ensemble in the wings, \"Joseon\" is poised to continue its culinary conquest.As a connoisseur of K-dramas and now of Chef Debbie\\'s culinary realm, I may never don the robes of a Joseon prince, but dining at \"Joseon\" is a royal decree I shall gladly obey.', \"Our time at Joseon was nothing short of amazing, offering a delightful journey into modern Korean fine dining. The service was outstanding, creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere that added to the overall experience. We opted for the 7-course meal and decided to try the bone marrow add-on, a decision we didn't regret.Out of the array of dishes, four truly stole the spotlight: the Wagyu Beef Tartar, the Wagyu Oxtail, the Black Cod, and the bone marrow. They were all extraordinary! Each dish brought its own unique and delicious flavor that made our overall experience truly memorable. The opportunity to savor these exceptional dishes at Joseon was a treat, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic culinary adventure in modern Korean cuisine.\", \"With so many KBBQ spots in KTown, its kinda nice to see something new and exciting come into view. Say hello to Joseon - a modern interpretation of Royal Court Dining from Korea's Joseon Dynasty (circa 1392). Chef Debbie Lee has put together an incredible five and seven course tasting menu that everyone should experience. From the Wagyu Beef Tartar with Seaweed Crackers to the Wang Mandu with Ginger Pork Rillette to the Wagyu Beef Tongue and the Braised Oxtail Stew. Its all extraordinary. Coupled with the fantastic drink pairings, what you end up with is one of the most special and unique dining experiences in Los Angeles. I cant wait to come back again.\", 'I have tried many Korean dishes and Joseon has given me a very different experience from the soft but beautiful ambience of the restaurant to the unbelievably delicious food! Service is attentive to the point that my glass of water was never empty! The location is at the heart of LA! The style, the taste, the color, the fragrance and to presentation of each dish gives me the best experience!! You gotta try it yourself!']\n",

Gnocci... Rissoto... very thing was on point.. the desert... to die forthe ambiance was calm and chill... very great place just to hand a drink.. had fun and will be back', \"The food was 3 stars . Wasn't good wasn't bad. The perch is popular. I recommend a reservation on the weekend. You wait outside on the sidewalk, while your table is being prepared. It's a true downtown experience; homeless on the side walk , busy streets, cars honking and dirty sidewalks.  Without a reservation you could be waiting for up to an hour. They have valet service reasonably priced. Ambiance is great . Roof top bar and patio dinning. Best to plan a head check the winter. On a clear night nothing beats the downtown skyline.Overall 4 stars.\", 'It\\'s got great views. The food is OK. But if they spill a drink on you, they don\\'t apologize. And if they spill that drink, they won\\'t comp you for another one, even though you are now soaking wet. And then, when you look at your bill, not only are you charged for that spilled drink, but they SNEAK IN A CHARGE called \"security charge\" and when you ask them what it is, they point to the other food items you bought and say \"security for these items,\" and when you stare back perplexed and inquire further, they say, \"OK, we\\'ll take it off.\"And then you say WTF. CHECK YOUR BILLS BEFORE YOU PAY.', 'Perch offers a delightful atmosphere with a view that steals the spotlight. The food, while good, leans towards the mediocre side, but the overall experience is elevated by the live music they had during our visit. The experience is worth the first visit to see what the hype is about...Our server added a sweet touch to my birthday with a delicious free dessert, ver much appreciated!', \"Fanatic service for brunch on a Saturday. Clear weather and couch seats with reservation were enjoyed. They have a retractable awning that's great to control the temperature. Drinks were garnished well and for $12 you can get a Bloody Mary to Bellini. The food is fantastic as well. Everything cooked to perfection, I liked sharing plates with friends so you get a sampler of every item. I saved the French toast last so the sweetness was like a dessert.\", \"Perch has been on my list forever... it kind of got buried under all the other lunch and brunch spots in LA. Lol! BUT I finally made it on Sunday!My friend and I made a reservation in advance. When we got there, we checked in w the hostess and were directed to wait at the elevator to be let up to the restaurant. We opted to skip the elevator, and took the stairs instead. When we got to the restaurant, we immediately got seated at the outdoor patio. The views are quite nice. The ambience is cute and eclectic. I got the burger and a bloody Mary. The bloody Mary was a good size and was tasty! I'd recommend if you're into bloody Mary's. As for the burger, I thought this was a good size, and the fries were generous. Full disclosure: I would've given this place more stars. However, I found a hair in my burger patty. I didn't want to make a scene or disturb brunch w my friends, so I didn't report it, but I def lost my appetite after that and finished the fries. I probably won't be coming back for this reason. Lol. I know mistakes happen, but yeah... no thanks. I'm glad I came once, and my curiosity is satiated. Otherwise, the staff was really kind and the service was great. The food overall was tasty. My friend got the shrimp scampi and that was good.Parking is pretty hard to find in downtown LA. Because I came on a Sunday, I was able to find free street parking. They have valet but idk how much that is.\", \"Haven't been back here in years, mostly because of LA traffic and parking sucks. BUT, there are public parking lots for $10 down the street and valet for $16. This rooftop bar has amazing views especially at night and makes for a cute romantic date night spot. So as we waited to take the elevator up to Perch, the staff in charge of letting guests into the elevator was hilarious. He kept saying how whoever was running the music kept playing Ariana Grande and Mac Miller  maybe let's switch up the music. Other than that it was a good night. Didn't have much interaction with the staff aside from that, so I can't speak on the service. Berry LA cocktail is my go to drink here!\", \"Heard about this place for a long time. Finally able to come for brunch.  They open at 10am and reservations is highly recommended.  Valet parking is on Hill $14 plus tips.  They text you rather than using a valet ticket.  Paid parking lots aroundTook elevator to 13th floor and then another one to the roof (15th floor)  Well marked.  The view is pretty cool but don't forget the interior is really nice too.  Huge indoor bar.  If you are a larger party, they will seat you inside usually.Sat outdoor for the brunch.  Had OJ, coffee, and crab cakes benedict.  Nice service.  Not bad food-wise.The reservations had strict timing guidelines but we were  there for a good 2 hours with a party of 4 and no one bugged us.  May be it wasn't that busy.  Waiting staff is really nice.  Hostess area is a little stand-offish thoughgreat experience if you have a chance go.\", \"Great dining experiences. Started from entrance till finished. Valet parking is available or use street or Athena Parking next to it for $15. Security guard at each floor. This is downtown LA. First Lift to 13th floor then greeted with another security and appointment check. Concierge service to leave any big large backpack bag etc. Another lift to 15th floor or you can take the stair. Greeted by the team again. Need complete party before seating. Only table for 8 inside. No outside dining for large party. Most table are of 4 and 2 everywhere. Nicely decorated inside the building. Outside patio has nice view of Pershing Square and Downtown LA. Food has to be Prix Menu for large party reservation. 4 course or 5 course options. We chose 5 courses. All of them are good. From opening course: Fromage and Charcuterie plate, Main Course and Dessert. We're celebrating Birthday and Wedding Anniversary. So they gave us complimentary mini cake with candle. Lisa and the team treat us with great service. Empty plate and new utensils at each course. They gave us wrong dessert order. Instead of changing them. They gave us extras. Price might be on higher end but it's worthwhile.It is kind of LA Staples Dining since not that many have rooftop dining.\", \"5/5 stars for Perch; if you haven't been here, you should definitely check it out! We made reservations to come here for dinner to celebrate a friend's birthday. We were running late and had called ahead of time, the waitresses were super accommodating and understanding. Upon checking in, we were seated immediately at the outdoor patio. It has a cute view of skyscrapers and isn't too cold because of the heat lamps. We ordered the steak frites (must try!). The truffle cheese fries are delicious; the perfect combination of truffle, cheesiness, and garlic.We ordered cocktails as well and got the:*noix de coco: rum, pineapple, strawberry-- tasted delicious like a milkshake; did not taste alcoholic at all*penthouse passion: tequila with some sweetness from the passionfruit*otto: similar to a more traditional old fashionBrett, the manager, was extremely helpful and offered excellent service to my friends and I. The staff were attentive to detail and went above and beyond for us. For my friend's birthday, they brought out two mini desserts, a caramel ice cream sundae and an ice cream pudding of sorts. Both were delicious and the perfect way to top off dinner.  There's also a rooftop bar two floors above which is worth checking out. They offer the same cocktails, but with a more open view of the downtown skyline. Overall, Perch was definitely a great experience and we'll for sure be coming back.\", 'No Fees', \"First things first, it took me years to finally try this place. I have to admit it's very cute place, especially the rooftop area. The food I'm going to say is good but not amazing as I expected. That's the thing about coming to these hyped up places in LA, it's always way too hype but not amazing. Quality is good but food was a bit dull for my taste. The pork belly was my fav thing we ordered. The staff was definitely great considering how loud our table was and how many drinks we ordered lol we are loud everywhere we go so I mean good thing everyone in the place was loud as well lol\", 'Ambiance was niceService was less than expectant I felt everyone was snobby and our waitress was unpleasant. As if she didn\\'t want to be there... I ordered French toast with berries on the side. I would\\'ve expected the brioche to be really fluffy but instead take a look. I wasn\\'t impressed. The hype is merely about the roof top.Not to mention you have to valet unless you walk a while and that was $14. I had my Alkaline water 33 oz and I was drinking it and I was told \" hey, no open containers\" I\\'m like this is water. He said it doesn\\'t matter. Now I\\'m really upset because who likes Evian water.. that is gross. At least have options. Not worth my trip downtown and That\\'s  for sure. In my opinion.', \"I've been to the 16th floor before for drinks but this last weekend was my first time actually eating at Perch. Usually places like this with a great view and ambiance have mediocre food, so I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the meal. It was about $30-$40 per person including tax and tip. Service is great too.FYI, reservations only open 2 weeks out. We were coming for a bachelorette brunch so it was a bit harrowing not knowing until 2 weeks ahead of time that we had a reservation, but it all worked out fine.\", '5 star brunch and 5 star views!Early Sat brunch for two with gorgeous views of Pershing square.  Friendly and great service.Bread plate with the most amazing scone and blueberry muffin!French toast was delish and appeared on most tables.My burger was hearty with Gruyère cheese and my frites were crunchy.The coconut drink was my favorite - like a pina colada with strawberry.Highly recommended!', \"Gotta look for and pay for DTLA Parking which was a hassle.You gotta find your way into the building and up the elevator and some more elevators cuhs this place is literally a hidden spot. Getting to the venue was not a breezy experience. Once we arrived, we were cramped in the hallway between the elevator and the check-in area. People were trying to travel in and out of the narrow hallway and it was just not the best experience. Service was okay--not good, not bad. Food was also mediocre. I think people come here more for the bar? The bar is also like a floor up from the dining area and the stairway and everything is cramped and not the cleanest. I wouldn't come back for food. You get a view of little DTLA from the rooftop bar on the 16th floor.TLDR; cramped, hard to find, parking is also a pain, mediocre food & service, people may come here for the rooftop bar & night view.\", \"I came here for my birthday. The view, and the French Toast did not disappoint! The texture of the French Toast was perfect : a little chewy, a little soft with a light crunch! It is one of the best french toasts I've ever had. Service was good. Valet is $15. I recommend making a reservation. At noon, the rooftop bar opens up. The restaurant is on the 15th floor, a level below the roof top. So you can come to the restaurant for brunch/lunch  and then head upstairs for drinks. The view of downtown LA is quite magnificent! This place is also family friendly and I saw children dining there as well. Overall, a must visit for at least once! Tip: After you are done with your meal, I recommend taking advantage of the valet parking. Leave the car in valet and walk around the area to either the Broad Museum or Museum of Contemporary Art or the Last Bookstore. That way you don't have to pay parking twice and can enjoy the downtown area.\", 'Came to Perch for a birthday dinner and everything was great except the weather!! We came a little late in the night and it was freezing!!!! Why we sat outside instead of inside idk but the heater lamp near our table wasn\\'t working it was all bad in that aspect. But! The staff tried and tried to light it up again and even offered us blankets to stay warm. That itself was why their service is 10/10! They made sure we were comfortable.The food was great and everyone liked what they ordered. My boyfriends only complaint that his sea bass was a little small.... He also eyedMy steak and fries so of course i shared. They cooked the steak just how I asked it for \"medium\" and the fries were delicious! They also had a live band playing which was interesting to watch.All in all this place was pretty good.', 'Perch is always a good idea - great drinks, food (forgot to take pics) and views. Went there with coworkers on a Friday evening and had the best time.', \"A must for LA brunch! We snagged a brunch reservation for a Sunday at Perch the evening before. What a place! As many other reviews have mentioned, we chose to valet our car as it was the easiest parking option. As of October 2023, it was $16 to valet -- card only. You'll enter the lobby of the historic Pershing Wilshire building and take it all the way up to the 13th floor. Once you're there, you'll cross the hallway and take ANOTHER elevator up two more flights to the 15th floor. We had our IDs checked as soon as we got off the elevator by a rather aggressive security woman and then were escorted out to the patio to soak in the view. Food and drinks were okay, nothing to write home about. We both enjoyed the Two Eggs Any Style breakfast which comes with potatoes and your choice of chicken sausage or bacon. It all needed quite a bit of salt and pepper, which wasn't at the table so we had to wait for our server to come around to ask. The star here really is the view. We sat in a corner of the patio, so our view was a bit obstructed but enjoyable nonetheless. At the end of the meal, they brought out a complimentary ice cream as we were celebrating a birthday! I had put it on the OpenTable reservation, but we didn't mention it to anyone in person -- it was a nice touch.After eating, we headed upstairs to the Rooftop Bar which opens at 12 on weekends. Despite there being very little shade, we loved the rooftop! This is where the view really gets good, and we were able to soak it all in from all directions. It was an expensive experience, but you pay for the view. I'm hoping to come back again one day when it's a little cooler.\", 'Good times! Good food! Great views!My friend and I went on a Friday night for a friend date. We had a great table right by the glass and watched the sunset (Pics never do it justice). We had Happy Hour drinks (4pm-6pm) and dinner. Didn\\'t take tooooo many pictures because we were deep in conversation and then made friends with the table next to us and had a blast. I had the Chilean Seabass and it was DELICIOUS and PERFECTLY cooked! Tender juicy fish, delicious risotto and perfectly cooked and seasoned - wait for it- carrots, of all things lol They were so good! At 7pm, a cute trio played some great \"vibey\" music and we met more people on the rooftop and had the best time. 10/10 recommend and will be back!', 'No Fees']\n",

More seating and everything is brand new since they opened just before Thanksgiving.  Suyuk and the Buchucheon are delicious as is the Gukbap (of course).  They also had delicious sun dae (blood sausage) which I don't remember from the 3rd St location.  Service was speedy and very friendly.

Street parking on a Monday night was too difficult to find.I came here for the pork gukbap, which comes with pieces of tender pork in a very rich and umami broth. The soup isn't seasoned, so you add salt, salted shrimp, and a red chili paste to taste. It comes with rice and rice noodles that you can mix into the broth. This is the perfect meal for a cold day outside.This location also has a lot more variety for its side dishes, it came with kimchi, white kimchi, pickled radish, and even raw marinated spicy crab. Overall this place meets the same high expectations as the original restaurant!\", 'My favorite Pork soup restaurant in Korean town We had pork soup, spicy cold noodles, leek pancake and grill pork ribs Everything is so delicious The new location at 8th street is bright and clean and private parking lot is behind itThe server is so nice and smiling all the time and always come to check if we need anything', 'This place is sooooooo stinking good. Definitely recommend coming with friends so that you can order a lot and share!I love all of the broths. I found the broth of the boiled pork SUPER rich, and the meat was incredibly tender! The pancake was super crispy, the galbitang was savory and comforting, and the cold noodles were acidic and refreshing. Service is fast and kind. The place is very casual, so just go and have fun!', \"For how recently they've opened, they're already quite busy! We found that the quality of food and service was on par with their other location. We got the leek pancake, small pork belly, and yukgaejang (beef soup with shredded beef brisket). I don't recall getting spicy marinated crab as a banchan at their other location, so was pleasantly surprised when it was included with their usual lineup. The crab was fresh and the marinade was flavorful without being salty. It was honestly more tasty than some places that offer this as an entree. The rest of the food came out in a timely fashion, piping hot. The pork belly was really tender, with a nice balance of lean and fat. I like le that their noodles were the flat rice noodles because it prevented sogginess. The yukgaejang was what we expected, good but not necessarily their specialty. We were able to find metered street parking in front of the restaurant. They also have a small parking lot that offers valet for $2 during lunch and $3 during dinner.\", \"Super clean inside. Very spacious. Really attentive service.The menu is slightly different from the 3rd St location but they said they will be adding more items slowly. It's a soft opening for now.

      "Reviews: [\"Beauty & Essex nails it every time. The place has this trendy, dim-lit vibe that sets the mood just right, especially if you're gearing up for a night out. And the food? Spot on. Their pizza? A must-try. It's quickly become one of those places I just can't pass up. If you're looking for a spot that combines ambiance with killer eats, Beauty & Essex should be on your list. Trust me, it's worth it.https://loanlightyears.com/\", \"Cool trendy spot in Hollywood. I came here for my birthday with two other friends on a Saturday night. Although we made reservations we still had about a 30 minute wait. When we were seated the section we sat in was a little quiet compared to the rest of the restaurant you really could not hear the DJ. After a while they eventually turned up the music and it was better. For the food, we ordered everything tapas style and shared. The scallops were probably my favorite followed by the mini Grilled Cheese Dumplings. Kale and Apple Salad was really good we ordered two of them because we were really hungry.  We also got the Truffle Mac which was decent. We honestly ate a lot of food between the three of us. I would say don't bother with the cupcake dessert. We had one of them and it was a little dry. Otherwise the atmosphere and small plates were delicious. Great opportunities for photos ops!\", \"After staring at the menu of Beauty and Essex at the Cosmpolitan, my blushing bride decide that we would celebrate a special family event at Beauty and Essex in Hollywood. We highly respect Chris Santos from his demeanor and knowledge as a TV cooking show judge. It's clear that his staff reflects these virtues!The experience was actually very nice and we had a great family celebration. Nikoly helped us navigate the menu, whcih I found iniitally to be a bit daunting. His initial focus was on the apps and other one-bite dishes, each at about $5/bite. I've never added up the total number of bites my family needs to get a filling meal but it would be a lot... like a really lot! He quickly helped us formulate a plan for a family meal that included a combination of apps, main courses, and side dishes. I really respected how Nik represented both his employers interests and ours in a completely responsive and professional manner.First item were drinks, and all were really well-made. The cocktail list is interesting, innovative, yet familiar enough to not be scary. Apps were baguette and burrata, which both were fantastic. I must admit that I'm a bit uncomfortable with a 12-dollar baguette but that's not too unusual in this day and age.For dinner we shared the half chicken, scallops, potatos bravas and lobster mac&cheese. For me the clear winner was the chicken, which rivaled that experienced at Thomas Keller's Bouchon. I wasn't too thrilled by the mac& chese, though. I thought it was quite underwhelming but the family loved it so I must be wrong.  :)For dessert we saw a clear diversion of intent. I ordered a 1/2 dozen oysters and the family ordered the Wonder Wheel.  The oysters were absolutley fantastic: small, fresh, perfectly shucked, and very tasty. The variety of dessert bites on the Wonder Wheel was also quite good and the wheel itself made for a really fun experience.Only one thing that made me a bit uncomfortable and the reason why this is 4-stars rather than 5. We were seated in the booth adjacent to the kitchen door. All staff members moved silently and we barely noticed their comings and goings. Except for one gentleman waiter. I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable at the way he looked at us each and every time he passed, seemingly with a sneer. He wasnt' our waiter and I couldn't figure out why he was even looking at us and even more couldn't figure out why he seemed to have some sort of attitude. I'm trying to not take it personally but...\", \"Vegan review: I was brought here for a dinner date on a Friday evening. The entrance is through an alley with some cute mirror photo ops. The front room has the appearance of a pawn shop. Then you walk through a lobby to the bar, main dining room, and patio seating. We were seated inside the main dining room. It has a romantic upscale boujee ambiance, exactly what I had hoped for. Heads up, the lighting is very dim, though there's at least a candle at each table. Some people were dressed more casually and others nicer. I was in a long evening gown and did not feel out of place at all. When I asked the waiter about the vegan options, he brought out a separate menu for vegan dishes only, which is super awesome! It eliminated all the hassle and guesswork so I could just order and enjoy my meal without worry. The waiter told us that guests typically order a few dishes and share, so keep that in mind. Our server Omar was great and they were super on top of refilling our water. The Thai BBQ Mushroom dish was served on fried rice cakes with a broccolini slaw on the side and topped with sesame seeds. Two waiters separately told us it was their favorite vegan dish on the menu so I had to give it a try. It was very flavorful and perfect for fellow mushroom lovers. My friend rated it 8.8/10The Roasted Heirloom Carrots were served with a coconut cream. The carrots weren't hot when they arrived to the table, which didn't bother me, but just wanted to note. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I didn't know carrots could be that delicious. The cream was so good too. My omni friend tried both of the vegan dishes and enjoyed them very much too. He ordered the deep dish pizza with pepperoni. He's a harsh pizza critic, and gave this a 7.7 rating (10 being absolute perfection cooked by God himself). He also got the Woodsman cocktail and said it was damn good and they didn't skimp on the alcohol. The pricing was what you'd expect for a place like this in Hollywood. Fair for the location, service, etc. Making reservations was easy and valet parking was super close by and worth it for this area of Hollywood. Overall, perfect spot for a fancy dinner in LA. A++ service for vegans! I would definitely come back again, maybe on Sundays when they have live jazz. My friend rates it an 8.7 overall experience. Now this may sound weird, but do not skip out on a trip to the toilet! The ladies room has a glamorous pink and silver lounge where they were serving complimentary champagne. It would be such a cool spot for a little hangout and pics with the girls. I felt like I stepped into an alternate universe or movie, it was a side quest in and of itself. One more thing, as a party of two, we were placed along the wall, one seated on each side of the table. My friend on the wall was sharing couch seating with one person in the party seated beside us. This was just a bit odd and a little too close for comfort in my opinion. It was okay and didn't bother me too much but it took away from the intimacy. There was enough space that it didn't feel like we were on top of each other but enough to feel like it was encroaching on our privacy a bit. I think if they were two chairs instead of a couch it would feel less weird. I could imagine someone larger being uncomfortable.\", 'Wow.  What a great night we had!  We went for DineLA on a friday night.  The valet parking was a whopping $20, but the valet was friendly and it IS Hollywood.  Many of the patrons and the hostesses look like they are club goers.  I thought that we might be a little out of place, but no one made us feel that way.  In fact, service was TOP NOTCH on every level.  Every single employee that we interacted with was friendly.  We felt very welcome.  Amazing.  The atmosphere is excellent.  You get the Speakeasy theme right away and there are a lot of Gatsby vibes with the extensive bead decorations.  Lush...that\\'s a good word for it all.5/5 - 24oz Bone-In Ribeye:  Seasoning was EXCELLENT!  So much flavor and perfectly cooked and tender.  My new #1 steak.5/5 - Cookies & Cream:  House made chocolate chip cookie with a boozy milkshake shot.  I\\'ll take a carafe please!5/5 - Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings:  Delicate dumpling.  The flavors are delicious, but it doesn\\'t really taste like grilled cheese.  Doesn\\'t matter though...I would definitely get this again.4/5 - Berries & Cream:  Butter cake, farm fresh berries and chantilly.  A little dry, but much better with the fruit and cream.4/5 - Skirt Steak Frites:  In roasted garlic-bacon sauce and served with garlic aioli.  Some parts were excellent, but other parts of the meat were chewy.  The sauce was great.  The fries were thin and crisp, but the seasoning was a bit overwhelming in spots.4/5 - Butter Basted Scallops:  shrimp and saffron rice, peri peri sauce, crispy linguica.  Scallops were cooked perfectly.4/5 - Burlesque Show:  Traditional Old Fashioned3/5 - Woodsman:  Pear muddled Old Fashioned.  A little too sweet.3/5 - Kale & Apple Salad:  My husband enjoyed this, but I was not a fan.  Apple Cider Vinaigrette, pancetta, candied pecans, shaved goat cheese. 1/5 - Mexican Street Corn Ravioli:  The description says \"roasted pompano creme, cotija, cilantro lime butter\".  They do not mention whatever sweetener they added.  This was not corn-sweet, it was like honey-sweet.  No thank you.  I did not get the Mexican Street Corn flavor from this.  Disappointed.The food and drinks came out to 3.8 stars.  I happily round up to 4 stars for the excellence of the top dishes.  The service and atmosphere blows that up to 5 stars.  When I come back, I know how to get all 5 star food.  Looking forward to it!', 'Absolutely delighted with my experience at Beauty & Essex! Amiah, our waitress, provided top-notch service, enhancing our dining pleasure. The food was beyond incredible--every dish we ordered was a culinary delight. The atmosphere exudes sophistication, and the playlist is nothing short of amazing. I absolutely loved every aspect of Beauty & Essex, making it a solid 5-star dining destination!', \"I've been eyeing Beauty & Essex for a while. It has prime real estate on one of Hollywood's hottest blocks, and has been a staple to the scene since it opened. Now was this the best dining experience I have had? No. But I did have nice time spent with my girlfriend celebrating our anniversary. Don't get me wrong, the food is good! We had the steak frites, tuna tartare tacos, and grilled cheese soup dumplings. All of which tasted great, but aside from the surprise hit in the dumplings, I can't say this was a very memorable meal. The restaurants biggest issue is in its menu. It's just too basic. The apps are the most unique options on the menu and what stood out the most. The grilled cheese dumplings are a must have anytime you visit. Aside from that, I can't give any glowing recommendations on what to order from the mains. We kind of just kept reading and were like, is that it? While what we received tasted very appetizing, I think there's room for improvement for the restaurant in how creative they are with their entrees. The inside is a bit cheque, riding on the verge of tacky without any eye popping qualities in terms of design. It's incredibly dim, but there are some cool chandeliers that caught my eye. It draws the crowd you would expect, so at least they know who they're catering to. Beauty and Essex was fun and it's suitable destination for a one-time visit for an easy date night (at least the prices were fair!), but I would probably have my reservations in going back.\", \"Overall, I had a great experience at Beauty & Essex. The ambiance is incredible, and we happened to visit on a Sunday night when there was live jazz music, which was an amazing surprise. The food is divine, and the menu is meant to be shared. They had a nice selection of drinks, and I opted for a black tea-based mocktail to start off our meal. I think the appetizers are the real star of the show here, including the mini French dip sandwiches and grilled cheese, smoked bacon & tomato soup dumplings. It's a really unique variety of items and the 2 we tried were delicious. I also thoroughly enjoyed the steak frites as a main course. Ours came out a little rarer than we asked for, but the flavor was great and the thin fries were perfectly crispy. Finally came the desserts, which were similarly extravagant and fun.Our service was not the best. We visited early on a Sunday night so it was not that crowded, but there were times where I felt like we didn't see our server for ages. But overall it was a wonderful evening!\", \"We had visited the bar and lounge of this beautiful restaurant in Hollywood before. I really liked the strong and tasty cocktails. Of course the cocktail prices have increased drastically after pandemic. Champagne prices were not bad to my surprise. They offer impressive gluten free and vegan menus. We really liked the eclectic dishes with an Asian fusion twist. The patio seating was very relaxing and spacious with beautiful potted plants. It was jazz Sunday but the entire restaurant was kind of empty. They didn't even need to open the upstairs dining area. For food we decided on fresh oysters, Thai shrimp, Branzino, filet mignon and broccolini. The food tasted fantastic and so flavorful. The portions were on the bigger side. We loved the dessert wheel in the end and it was fun to try them all. Our drinks were very well made and tasty too. We really enjoyed our dinner with jazz music in the background. It was a lovely evening for hubby and I. Our server was so friendly and attentive, in fact all staff were very welcoming and pleasant. I was glad that Beauty & Essex didn't disappoint, Tao group is really up to their game! We will definitely be back whenever we want a special dinner in Hollywood!\", 'I recently visited this trendy spot in the heart of LA, , jewel-toned eatery with vintage decor offering New American plates, drinks & wine and it instantly won me over with its chic atmosphere and inviting outdoor patio. The veg options, including the margherita pizza, burrata, patatas bravas, and street corn ravioli, showcased a delightful blend of flavors. To top it off, I ventured into the world of zero-proof cocktails, savoring the refreshing mint lemonade and the intriguing platinum peacock, both of which exceeded my expectations. A noteworthy perk is their valet service, making the overall experience seamless. Highly recommend for a stylish and satisfying evening.', \"My husband and I had a reservation Saturday evening. We arrived at 5:45pm and we were seated at 6pm in the upstairs dining room to the right. We were the first party to be sat there. The ambiance was nice, darkly lit and romantic. Very LA fine dining vibe. More parties were seated in this dining room section and the noise definitely picked up, it was hard to hear yourself talk.Honestly, I was ready to give this restaurant 1 star and leave before ordering our food. We waited almost 25 minutes for someone to take our order. We watched 4 parties who came after us get their orders taken AND we watched them get their drinks and food delivered to their table. Not sure if they were under staffed tonight, but this was very frustrating since we had to make our showtime for the Pantages and I was worried if our food would come out in time. We made eye contact with two staff who would circle around the dining room, but they seemingly were just in charge of refilling water.My husband talked me down and finally, our waiter approached our table. My husband politely informed him that we have been waiting for a while to place our order and would have to leave soon to catch our show. Our waiter kindly apologized and he did do his best to remedy the situation.As soon as we put in our orders, I got up to use the bathroom and by the time I got back, all the food was already there on our table. They even gave us an extra complimentary dish of meatballs. This gesture and the swiftness of getting our food quickly to us was very much appreciated.We ordered:- Braised chicken meatballs 5/5: juicy, tender meat and strong flavor with creamy truffle sauce- Classic Thick Cut Filet 4.5/5: the steak on its own was very flavorful and came out perfectly medium rare, sauces were just okay- Baguette with garlic chive butter 3.75/5: bread was warm and soft with a crunchy crust; butter was creamy and easy to spread, but the taste kind of reminded me of AMC popcorn butter which isn't a bad thing- Mac and cheese with shrimp and lobster 2/5: Al dente pasta, saucy had a nice creamy consistency but there was absolutely no flavor to it; the only flavor came from the lobsterWe also ordered drinks. The Beauty Elixir was just okay, it tasted just like a glass of champagne but with a frothy consistency from the strawberry and cucumber pulp yet no hint of the fruits' flavor. My husband liked his drink though the Spicy Crush.Overall, I strongly give this restaurant 3 stars. The food borders between decent and good. I don't think it's worth its very expensive price point to warrant a second visit. Our server was kind and tried his best to make up for our situation. I just really wish the restaurant would have a better system of attending to guests once they are seated in the order they arrive.\", \"A really beautiful restaraunt, but the food fell short. Neither myself or any of the 4 people I was with enjoyed their meals. While I usually would give places a second chance, after trying 4 separate meals and not enjoying one, I think it's safe to say the food is just not good.\", \"The restaurant has a nice hip, warm vibe with music playing in the background whether you sit inside or outside. There are plenty seating options courtyard, main dining room, and bar.  The food is innovative, tasty and delicious. All the dishes are great for sharing and you can add on additional pieces to the plates. We had the Grilled Cheese, Smoked Bacon & Tomato Soup Dumplings (a must try), Tuna Poke Wonton Tacos (a must try), Little French Dips(just ok), Lamb Chops (super tasty), Rib Eyes (just alright), Branzino fish (really good), Chocolate Peanut Butter Cake, and the 'Berries & Cream' butter cake (our favorite). We also got a side of Patatas Bravas (Baby Yukon gold, guajillo sauce) super tasty and should also be on the list to try.\", \"Location: adorable perfect for pictures mainly in the entry area it's all about the estetics! Food is yummy 9/10 my hubby likedThe steak but it was limited options and he loves tender cuts. Seafood options are good and cocktails are strong! I' would return for bday celebration but plan for small parties. The area is small and limited space when sitting. Girls night out I think is more of the vibe I got!\", \"Beautiful and fun restaurant to dine at, before a show at The Pantages. It's a quick 10-minute walk from the theater, but watch out for the many homeless encampments, along the route. Seen a dude with a knife. Entrance was a little hard to find, it's off Selma, not Cahuenga. The entrance is cool. Looks like a pawn shop, but opens into a beautiful dining area. We sat upstairs and it was still early, so it was like we had a private dining area, but eventually filled up by the time we left. We were celebrating a birthday, and I made note of that when booking the reservation, so there was a happy birthday note on the menu, upon being seated. So nice!The service was great, from entrance through the entire meal, very friendly staff. The food was delicious and cocktails were refreshing. The bread sounds simple, but it was perfectly toasted on the outside, pillowy on the inside, with a garlicky butter. Steak was perfectly cooked, but less of the sauce would be better, because it's tender and flavorful enough, so doesn't need a lot of sauce. The Japanese fries were bomb, get them! We ordered the chocolate mousse dessert and it came with an edible birthday chocolate note and candle. Cool spot, would come back and try more dishes.\", \"Fantastic!!Stand out service!  Everyone, from the door man to the busier gave superb service. The ambiance is very slick/cozy/warm. The food A++++. The chicken meatballs were out of this world. My mum loved the Tomato soup/grilled cheese. This is my first time going so I wasn't truly aware that it was like a tapas place. So, order to share and make sure to order enough if you've got a big appetite. This sort of dining is my favorite  Definitely a must go, especially if you're headed to the Pantages (about 5 blocks away. Yes we walked to the theater).\", \"I recently dined at Beauty and Essex in Los Angeles for my friends birthday and it was an absolutely stunning experience. From the moment I walked in, I was transported to a glamorous and chic world. The decor is simply stunning, with glittering chandeliers, plush velvet seating, and stylish accents everywhere you look.As for the food, it was simply amazing. The drinks were strong and enjoyable. The menu features a wide range of delicious dishes, from classic comfort food to more upscale options. Once we left, we definitely left full and satisfied. What we ate:Appetizers:Kale & Apple saladGrilled cheese & tomato soup dumplingsTuna poke wonton tacosBeauty & Essex Cheeseburger slidersEntree:Oven braised chicken meatballsRoasted salmonSides:Mac & CheeseTogarashi FriesDesserts:Berries & creamMilk shake shotsThe service was also top-notch. Our server was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu, and the rest of the staff were equally professional and helpful.Overall, I highly recommend Beauty and Essex to anyone looking for a truly special dining experience in Los Angeles. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or just looking for a night out with friends, this restaurant is sure to impress.\", 'My first visit was Mother\\'s Day 2023. Valet parking was very easy to miss, we ended up in front of the hotel and had to make another loop around the block to get into the right area. Coincidentally the \"right area\" was in the middle of the street. The guy at the valet gave us a ticket, put our keys in the car and then ran off to move other cars that arrived after us. My husband stayed back for more than 10 minutes waiting for his car to be parked. He watched as other cars were moved before his. He alerted the valet one more time about his car and was assured that the car would be safely parked. We were promptly seated at our table. Water was offered immediately. It took another 20 minutes for a server to come and he only took a drink order. It was another 20 or so minutes for the waiter, Christian, to take our food order. The appetizer course came out in a decent amount of time but our entrees took forever. We were more than 2 hours into brunch before all of the food was delivered to our table.  We kept ordering bread because we were starving, I didn\\'t realize each loaf was $12!  The chicken arepas was pretty good. I was shocked by the hot bottom part and the cold inner part. I\\'m not sure if everything was supposed to be the same temperature. I had the salmon, pretty small portion and very limited on the flavor. The server was really slow and most of the food was just ok. The ambience was cool, I\\'d love to check this place out at night when the kids aren\\'t around. I would probably enjoy my 3 hour meal much more without entertaining young ones. The prices seem a little high since the food is wasn\\'t amazing! Portions were small and I still left pretty hungry. We tried ordering additional food and drinks and decided to cancel once the 3 hour mark hit and nothing has been delivered.', \"What a great great find and let's talk about the decor... so cool. We had the tuna taco and  ravioli ... so yummy - will be back for more and try the Jazz night on Sunday as well. Did I mention the service was incredible and everyone seems happy and friendly there. Love\", \"You can't go wrong with this spot if you're trying to have a nice dinner! Not too busy on a weekday and the ambiance is great. The seafood and steak frites were absolutely amazing, nothing was underwhelming. The drinks are tasty too. Only thing that was lacking was the service, waited for about 15 minutes for the check while our server kept passing us by. Otherwise the meal is def worth trying once.\"]\n",

The staff is incredible, charming, and professional. The food is heavenly. My table agreed it was the best octopus dish we ever had. The capers and the sauce complemented the tentacle beautifully. The funghi pinsa came highly recommended and it lived up to its expectations. The flavor was powerful and the dough was so unique. I couldn't appreciate the recipe more!!The frutti de mar blew me away. I am a big fan of squid ink pasta and this was so well done. I loved the sauce, I loved the mussels, and I loved the shrimp!! A packed dish that was worthwhile. My kudos to the chef and amazing staff here at Oste. I can't wait to show more friends this establishment and try more dishes.\", 'LOVE THIS PLACE!!! If you are looking for amazing authentic Italian food, go to Oste. Their pastas are amazing and the mussels are to die for! We also ordered the burrata and the octopus and they were all delicious! Casual yet elegantly styled with a fantastic atmosphere, this place strikes the perfect balance. The vibe is both relaxed and sophisticated, making it a great choice for various occasions.The service here is beyond amazing. The two owners were checking up on us throughout the entire meal and making sure me and my friends were enjoying the dinner. Very impressive!! And the servers are friendly and very professional. All of them truly made our dining experience enjoyable and memorable. Must try- BurrataSofia (mussels)Octopus Frutti di mareCacio e pepePanna cotta', \"Authentic amazing Italian food that won't break the bank.Service 10/10: we came on a Sunday evening with no reservations and were seated within 10min. They have indoor and outdoor seating. They have heaters outside and it's actually quite nice. Romantic ambiance, great for date nights. Menu offers a variety of dishes, from pasta to mains, to mussels and a burrata bar. But the pizza is the item to try. They dough is crunchy and made in house. The pepperoni is a must try and if you love prosciutto, then that's a winner as well. Food comes out very fast and they prefer to bring items out as they are ready, but you can request otherwise. The best part is the prices are reasonable for the quality you get.  I will be back to try others items from the menu and keep everyone updated!\", 'Oste offers delicious Italian food paired with friendly and welcoming service. My boyfriend and I arrived later than our party, and the boss greeted us at the entrance and led us to our group right away. Our server was also so friendly and charming. The interior is modern, open, and inviting. Perfect for a group of friends or a date. Onto the food, I tried the radicchio salad and pappardelle alla vaccinara. The salad was perfectly seasoned and dressed. The greens tasted fresh and crisp. The pappardelle noodles were cooked Al dente and homemade. The sauce tasted very comforting, and the oxtail was very tender. My only critique is that the sauce had a bit more flavor and pizzazz. However, the tiramisu was to die for. Absolutely indulgent and delicious. Overall, we really enjoyed our meals and would come back.', 'seriously one of the best italian restaurants out in LA! The owner is also always there as well and checking up on tables and chatting it up with all of the customers! ordered our usual, along with a side of burrata which tasted amazing! The owner said they also get it shipped straight from italy! As always, Oste has the best service and food!- Margherita pizza with sausage - side of burrata - cacio e pepe - pappardelle alla vaccinara - fries & aioli', 'Amazing service who frequently checked in with us and had great recs.The mussels were so fresh and tasty in the rich broth which we then used to dip our pizza bread crust in per the servers rec! Pizza itself was huge and doughy with the perfect crunch to it. Cacio e Pepe was flavorful and would not recommend the caramel something., too sweet. Easy free parking in the neighborhoods .All in all, highly rec for a dinner spot with friends or your s.o! Also right by the grove too so you can do some shopping after!', \"Loved the service. Food was well prepared and presented. The only complaint was the too salty risotto. Told the server and they took it away. Blamed it on the cheese ! Deserts were delicious. A little loud at times but it's aneughbirhood bistro. Would definately try again.\", \"I love trying new things so I was excited to try Oste's specialty - a Roman-style pizza called the pinsa. We came on a Monday night and it wasn't too crowded. We were able to choose outdoor seating on their beautiful patio. All the staff here were friendly and attentive. They gave us suggestions and helped us narrow down on our orders. Here's what we got (ranked from favorite to least favorite):Funghi Pinsa ($25)When in Oste, you must try one of their pinsa! It's a healthier alternative to the traditional pizza without sacrificing the taste - the crust delivers on the crunch with a light and airy inside. Usually I'd get meat toppings, but the combination of wild mushrooms, cheese, garlic, and truffle oil was so flavorful and heavenly!Truffle Fries with Truffle Aioli ($11)If you love truffles, you'd love these fries. The fries were crispy and tossed in truffle oil. Then, there's truffle aioli on the side in case you want a double dose of truffle flavor. The truffle aioli was so good, I'd dip everything in there. This came with a huge portion of fries so it's perfect for sharing - even when you may not want to!Claudia Mussels ($25)I love mussels so I was excited to see that they have 4 different broths to choose from. The Claudia is a white wine based broth with shallots, bacon, garlic, and parsley. This broth went really well with the mussels - it was savory and garlicky. My only wish was that it came with bread to dip in. And although there was a generous portion of mussels, they were small and not as plump.Homemade Bread & EVOO ($3)This bread is made from the same dough used to make pinsa. These were cut into thin strips and were super crispy. They were nice for dipping in the mussels broth, but I didn't enjoy eating it on its own since I prefer the soft parts of bread.Overall, this is a solid spot if you want some guilt-free Roman-style pizzas! I can't wait to go back to try other pinsas!\", \"Everything was pretty solid. We got three mains and one side shared between 3 people. Just enough to get full without having leftovers (except the complimentary bread) The vibes are really intimate but casual as well. It's not too loud so we can have conversation. The servers were super nice too and spoke little bits of Italian which added to the experience :) I would definitely come again to try something else. Loving the people here as well! This whole street is also really cute so you could walk around after as you digest. There's a good gelato place right nearby as well. Valet $12.\", \"Excellent food. Parking is tough so Valet $$ get the bucks. The mushroom pizza is the best I have ever had and almost everything is excellent. This place is not in my area but it's definitely worth the drive since it's always a great experience. The wait staff and usually very attentive.\", 'Was craving pasta and heard great things about this place so we decided to give it a try! We were able to easily make reservations the day before online. The day of, we were able to get seated right away. We came for a late dinner so the were plenty of seats, honestly was surprised there wasnt more people. We decided to get their bread, beef tartare, sofia mussels and the oxtail ragu pasta. And everything was SOOOO GOOD. The bread went amazing with the mussels. The pasta was super rich and flavorful. The tartare was super fresh and flavorful as well.The customer service was amazing. They checked on us frequently and even swapped out our plates for new ones once. They also waited to bring out our pasta when we were ready since our table was full. They helped time it and had the kitchen start it later so it would be fresh and hot when we were ready for it.So good, would definitely recommend and come back in the future!!', \"For the number of times I've driven past this restaurant and not noticed it, I'll never drive by it again without thinking of the delicious dinner we had. With four of us in our party, we were eager to try different things and share as much as we could. The wait staff was extremely attentive and helpful as we debated and negotiated which dishes to get. In the end, we ended up with:- Homemade Bread & Evoo- Polpo al Cavolfiore- Suppli al Tartufo- Fiori do Zucca- Insalata do Radicchio e Fi- Burrata al Pesto- Margherita Pinsa- Patate Pinsa- Oste Tiramisu- Chocolate TartDespite some skepticism about the potato pinsa from one person in our party, that was one of the best things we ate. Although truly every savory dish we had was incredible. The chocolate tart was nothing to write home about. One challenge with the menu: not many main dishes that were suitable for vegetarians. Unsurprising when it comes to Italian food, but important to be aware of if you're trying to accommodate various dietary needs!We sat outside which was a nice, serene spot even though it's right on 3rd Street. It was a bit challenging when passersby would be smoking, and there was one person waiting for their table who was smoking and the cigarette smoke continued to waft for 5ish minutes. Obviously nothing to do for the restaurant, but just something to remember when you're sitting outside along a busy street. I'll absolutely recommend this spot to others and can't wait to come back to try more menu items!\", \"I chose to have my birthday dinner at the long-awaited restaurant that I've always heard so much about.The vibe at the outdoor seating area for Oste was everything. I've never been to Italy but I felt like it transported me there with the beautiful plants along the wall and the gold embellishments of the tables and windows.For the food, we tried one appetizer and two entrees. The Fiori Di Zucca, aka squash blossoms, was one of the most popular items that people recommended on social media. I had never tried it before but I was pleasantly surprised. It's stuffed with ricotta and parmigiano and paired with salsa marinara which has a sweet taste to balance out the savoriness of the cheese. It's slightly crispy but creamy so it has a good balance of textures.I had such a hard time picking which pizza I wanted but I ended up with the Patate Pinsa: pizza with roasted potatoes, raclette, garlic oil, parmigiano, and rosemary. Since it wasn't your typical mozzarella, the cheese was rich and creamy which paired nicely with the thinly sliced potatoes. I also loved the touch of rosemary but some bites were much saltier than the others which threw me off. I was excited to try the Cacio e Pepe but I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. It was my first time ever trying this pasta too so I have nothing to compare it to but it was way too peppery. I could only eat one bite and then I had to move to something else to cleanse my palette. Although the food wasn't what I had thought it'd be, the service was amazing. Multiple waiters helped us out but they all had such an uplifting attitude and came by often to replenish our water. We made reservations and arrived later than expected due to the difficult parking situation but they were accommodating and still let us in.\", 'We didnt make a reservation but was immediately greeted and sat down by the bar on a busy Saturday.  Everything we ordered was amazing but my favorite was the cacio e pepe which has a fresh lemon taste on top that brings out the flavor even more and just takes this dish to another level imo. The host and the bartender were very attentive and checked on us many times which we appreciate. Definitely come back to try other dishes on the menu and coffee from that custom made espresso machine.', \"I think that this is probably one of the best pizzas that I have had in LA. As much as I don't want to give the pizza crown to the east coast, they do it really well over there. However, Oste's pinsas put up a good fight! There's a blurry distinction between pizzas and pinsas that only really gets cleared up with a Google search -- pinsas have different flours in the dough as opposed to traditional whole wheat flour, meaning it has more protein and less gluten for those interested in a healthier option. You can't really taste the difference though and the only way I can tell, at least, is by the shape. Pinsas are ovally shaped rather than having a circle or square shape. These were absolutely fantastic tasting, my margherita pinsa was crispy, easy to bite into and real juicy with the tomato sauce lathered generously on top of the dough. I would have preferred maybe an extra basil leaf or two, but it was absolutely delicious. The funghi pinsa was also quite good, but it's generally not my favorite as mushroom pizzas are typically a little bit too dry and difficult to eat for me. It also stated on the menu that it had wild mushrooms on it, but it literally just looked like regular button mushrooms LMAO. The service was great and the ambiance was beautiful inside and outside, and had it not been for the hot weather, I would have loved to sit outside and enjoy the verdant outdoor seating. I'll definitely be adding Oste to the list of great pizzas in the LA area, highly recommend!\", \"Yuuuuuum!  I was craving pizza and this hit the spot!The dough was crispy with a chew, the flavor profile balanced between the cheese, mushrooms and truffle oil which was  prominent without being overpowering.A couple of small gripes: - wasn't sliced.  This crusty dough did not lend itself to being torn. Not sure how they expected people to eat it. - on the pricier side ($27 pre-tax for what's equivalent to a medium sized pizza)- I ordered takeout with a future pickup time, but it was ready about 30 minutes early...meaning it w as sitting there, cooling for 30min before I could pickup.  \\u200dTaste 5/5Service/price 3/5 Definitely bookmarked for returning for special occasions.\", \"The inspiration on the Roman Empire and process of making the pinsa (pizza) dough was the reason to explore this place . We had an outdoor seating which was comfortable and can request for  heaters if cold Oven roasted Romanesco : green cauliflower w almonds and sauce . First time trying this cauliflower so it was new and tasted okay .Viva L'italia : Pizza was very delicious slightly greasy but it was all good stuff . The dough is very light and complements the pesto w cheese .Cacio E Pepe :  This was the most disappointing dish and experience  . They took more than 20 min to get the pasta which was a wrong order and then got the right order in the next 5 min with a mess ( didn't serve it on spagettoni)Service was overall good but always have your advise the wait staff read out the order again to avoid the unpleasant experience .\"]\n",

      "Reviews: [\"I came here for brunch to celebrate my friend's birthday. It was so easy to make a reservation and parking was a breeze. You can self park for 3 hours with validation for free. When we got there we sat down right away. We wanted outside but the big umbrellas didn't cover all the sun so it was a little hot. Everything tasted great! The drink was one of the best spritzers I have had and the devil eggs were full of flavor. I got the shrimp and grits and the shrimp were huge! For dessert we shared a pop tart and the filling was the best part! It was a blueberry jam and delicious. The service wasn't amazing and it was nice to catch up with friends but after two hours we had to hunt the waiter down to ask for the check. I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu!\", \"I've been holding off on this review because I'm not exactly sure how I felt about this place. ***potential***Ok, so let me start off with the location and parking. The restaurant is located at a hotel. There's self-parking or you can get valet. The first three hours are free and there's a lot of parking spaces.I met my friend for Sunday brunch. It was a last minute plan so I did not make reservations. The place was packed but they were still able to accommodate us at a high top table near the bar.The food is what has me unsure of my feelings about this place. I ordered a chicken sandwich and my friend ordered shrimp & grits. My sandwich was just ok. The bun was hard and dry and it was not really flavorful. My friend said her food was just blah too and the portion was small. This place has so much potential. The food looks like it's going to be good and was a disappointment.We ordered cocktails from the menu. They were tasty but were lacking alcohol. Our waiter recommended a cocktail for my friend. She didn't like it and sent it back.We ordered dessert. The waiter forgot to place the order so we never received it.Again, I feel like this place has so much potential to be better than my experience. I'm willing to give it another shot if someone were to invite me. It's not lacking business so if I never make it back, it'll be ok.\", \"I love the ambience of the front yard. The food is good and the patio is great. I've been to the front yard for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  I think I prefer dinner, but all have been good.\", \"The ambiance is the absolute best part.

They were cold and kind of tasted stale. Everything else was yummy. Service was great. Bathrooms were clean. It is valet parking or you can park in the parking lot and they will validate for you. I look forward to returning in the future. *Make sure to try the brussels sprouts and Mac and cheese.\", 'Came here with my best friend on a Sunday brunch.Self parking was available and they validate which was nice!We waited ten minutes for our table and then got seated at a patio  booth which was nice.

We will definitely be back', \"The Front Yard is a beautiful aesthetic restaurant adjacent to the Garland Hotel in North Hollywood, minutes away from the Brady Bunch House and Universal Studios. The restaurant offers free parking for the first three hours with validation. There's even a free trolley that takes you from the Hotel to Universal Studios/Citywalk!I came to the Front Yard a couple of times already, and the service is good. Reservations are recommended. The food is good, albeit a bit pricey. I've celebrated the bestie's birthday here, and we ordered the green garbanzo hummus, pepperoni and sausage flatbread, and tagliatelle bolognese. We also ordered the Nutella cake for dessert, which was sweet and delicious. Overall, super cute aesthetic if you're looking to treat yourself.\", \"We had a family breakfast here after an event in Burbank. What a beautiful and fun spot and some excellent food and coffee too!  We were a group of 7 and our dietary requests and tweaks were met with flexibility and helpful suggestions. Servers get 5 stars . Food was perfect and delivered to our table in a timely manner and in unison even though the restaurant was a bustling Saturday Morning Crowd. Loved eating outside! But the indoor decor was intriguing and artistic. Bathrooms were clean & well-stocked. Coffee was delicious. And there are selections for those who don't eat meat or dairy.\", \"Came here for Saturday brunch and sat in the outdoor patio. If the weather is nice, I recommend sitting outside. The outdoor ambiance is definitely a plus.As for the food, I ordered the Breakfast Royale with Cheese and a side of adobo fries. My cousins ordered Smoked Salmon Flatbread and the Socal Chicken Sandwich. Overall, we were all content with our food. For dessert, we ordered the beignets and pop tarts. I was stuffed, but I couldn't say no to warm beignets.The service was on point. Alesha was prompt with providing us with extra condiments and more coffee or water.

She kept up with drinks and checked in on us often . Food- the food was just okay nothing that I would say I need to go back for . We had the enchiladas and the Carne asada and prawn . With the corn and cilantro rice. The good like I said was just okay . This is a fusion of a steak house meets Mexican food but not really big on steak selections .

Great customer service. We got the tomahawk with bone marrow, Mac n cheese, rice, and beans. Everything was delicious. The chef came out and seared the tomahawk and mixed the bone marrow in a salsa. So yummy!! The whole experience was great. The place was so beautiful. Nice place for a date night or celebration. Def returning for some good steak.', \"The food is amazing, it melts in your mouth. The drinks are outstanding if you order them directly from the bar not you waiter. I feel if you order your drinks and pay for them at the bar before you sit the bartenders put extra love as oppose if your waiter brings them. I noticed because I ordered a spicy margarita at the bar before everyone arrived and they put jalapeños on mine and let me tell you! It was delicious! My friend group ordered the same thing at the table and it was not the same. Maybe it was the tequila they used but they didn't even have the same garnish I did. Ambiance is a dark atmosphere, friendly staff, and the public seemed to be acting right. Nothing wild or crazy. I'd come back on a slower night if there is any lol just to eat the food.\", \"The food here is delicious!!! Toca Madera means to touch wood or knock on wood and I find myself knocking on wood to stay as privileged as I've been to be able to eat here. The service was over zealous and ended up forgetting 2 of our accompaniments but the service aside you come here for the food. There was a big group next to us and they ended up more worried about them but who cares.The food and ambiance are awesome. We had a tomahawk steak, Mexican sashimi with sides of street corn, rice and beans and almost had carrots but those were forgotten. But that's ok, because we were full of tomahawk. To finish it all off we had the  Oaxacan chocolate. The ambiance is dope, great music, lights that could brighter and a cool chill vibe. It a great place to come with a group as you get better service and pay less per head. But all in all the steak is there with the best of them. Well worth the hype!Thanks for helping us celebrate 7 years of love and Toca Madera if we see you again.\", \"Food is whatever. Drinks are okay except for one. We ordered some tacos and they were the size of my pinky. No exaggeration. $20 for two small ass tacos. I sent my drink back because it had way too much chili. Literally burning my throat and I LOVE SPICY. It was so bad. Basically, this place isn't worth your hard earned dollars\", 'I love the place Thank you so muchI like the drinks I got the Vodka with coconut with pineapple. The barman is sweet !! Try the taco with sea bass . Super delicious', \"I felt like a V.I.P.The wife's birthday is today to to celebrate we slid on down to Los Angeles for dinner date. I sent her several options based on what she was looking for food wise and she did what I did on this one. After checking into our hotel, we made our way to Toca Madera upon arrival of our way. Let us know it would be $16 to use the valet service and we would pay or upon our departure from the restaurant, I did my research before heading down there so the $16 fee was no problem. Once we made it to the front door we were meant by two well dressed security man asking if we had a reservation again I did my research and made sure we had a reservation on file to which they said thank you and open the door, we were met with a large crowd, but very cool almost Jazz like atmosphere and vibes after speaking with a hostess and confirming our reservation we were taken to a table and seated. The chips and salsa was pretty good but I was here for the main course we started with, chicken, flautas and wild mushroom quesadillas which was very filling. We ordered a virgin Mojito and the Uno Momento for a drink. After that we will ordered the truffle mac & cheese, truffle fries, and 8 ounce flat stake. All of the food came out, relatively quickly, considering the crowd. The temperature was hot for the majority of the time spent in the restaurant due to the open flames and sizable crowd. Our table was right next to the DJ booth, so there was lots of loud music, but it was really good and kept the atmosphere light I put in the reservation instructions that It was my wife's birthday, and they made sure to bring out a little ice cream on top of a churro with a sparkler and happy birthday written in chocolate sauce on the plate. Classic. The bill was high, but again I was expecting this and I totally feel like I got my moneys worth. If you're looking to splurge and eat some really good food. This is the place for you. We look forward to our next journey to this location.\", \"This place is the worst, I can't even describe how bad our experience was the customer service was terrible our server ignores us for like 20 minutes when he finally came to our table with a actitud we asked for drinks suggestions and he told us it depends what like you can see the menu he was very attentive with other table, passing by our table not even asked us if we need anything after a hour he bought us the check without even asking if we wanted dessert or anything else , I willNever go back the food was good drinks were good\", \"Toca Madera review based on service, food, and environment:  The server I had wasn't very engaging, rather quiet, and lacked friendliness. The atmosphere was confined on a humid patio, and the space felt quite small. On a positive note, the DJ provided great music that added to the overall experience. The food and drinks were enjoyable.Additionally, it's important to mention that the parking situation was inconvenient during my visit, I had to use self parking and park on a parking structure where I was not provided with valet parking.Inconsistent service can certainly impact the overall dining experience. It's valuable feedback for the restaurant to consider for improving their customer service.\", \"I'll start off by saying they have the most incredible drink menu. From the pictures to the drinks itself, it is extremely impressive. They offer a large variety of speciality cocktails, some which come flaming to your table. As for the food, it was nothing special. Presentation was lovely but for the price, I expected the food to wow me. Service was good and the atmosphere is fun. They have live DJ and music. I definitely suggest this spot for the drinks.\", 'This place is fantastic. At Least for brunch cocktails. We had a pretty good time sitting at the bar and served by Devon and Donovan. We really enjoyed the ambiance of a an in house DJ.', \"Wow, I was pleasantly surprised by my overall experience this past Friday night with a girls' night out. The ambiance is definitely tulum vives, but the guitarist giving Lenny Kravitz tunes was so cool along with the DJ. The cherry on top was the amazing food from start to end, we started with the Hamachi, which was so fresh with the perfect blend of flavors exploding in your mouth. We ordered the fish and carne asada tacos, kale salad, chicken enchiladas with the corn, and truffle fries. I I have no complaints because it was great food, something that normally does not come with beautiful restaurants. The service was great. I didn't have to ask for multiple water refills, along with the timing of service was great. I almost forgot the churro dessert was soooo good, and just for that, I  would go back, but we all know that won't be enough. Can't wait to go back!\"]\n",

      "Reviews: [\"Get the Margherita Pizza. Thank me Later. Best pizza I've ever had and I lived in Rome for 42 years. Simply divine. My sons loved it too and they don't like pizza at all. The wife and the kids never loved me more!\", 'The pizza and the ravioli was my new favorite. Every bite of the ravioli came with an explosion of flavor and yummyness. The deserts were also great. So many textures and full of surprises', \"One of the real reasons it's hard for me to ever consider leaving LA...also somehow lost my review so here's take 2- everything is literally so good you can't go wrong.antipasto-the caesar salad- yum. eat it jenga stylethe scallop crudo. always a favebone marrow I didn't get but I did last time and it comes with a pasta and. yum!pasta-you actually can't go wrong but we went with a spicy tortellini which was incredible. and. the sweet corn ravioli with lobster and little trout or salmon roe. so balanced. so flavorful.pizza -we got the Giancale and the burrata. both were so deliciousmains-branzino. comparable to bavel. so goodpork. came with cabbage and it was delicious. so so tender.desserts-I bet everything is good. we got the strawberry tart which was so good and the peaches and cream and the red maple something like hot little doughnut-beignets with some ice cream.you just can't go wrong here.\", \"Had a lovely time at Bestia.  Incredible, fun and hip atmosphere.  Sat at the bar as we stopped by without reservations and it was pretty busy. The food was really enjoyable.  We ordered the following: Peruvian Scallop Crudo - which was so fresh and citrusy.  Served with rosemary chili oil, cured cucumber, gaeta olives, mint and sesame. This is a light and refreshing appetizer which you will enjoy very much.Housemade Buttermilk Ricotta with aged balsamic, fennel pollen, herb oil, lava salt. Served with grilled bread.  This appetizer is so creamy and delightful.  We enjoyed every bite. Roasted Marrow Bone with spinach gnocchetti, crispy breadcrumbs and aged balsami.  The server will manually scrape the bone marrow into the pasta and stir it around.  The flavors are very satisfying and hearty.  We loved this dish. Slow Roasted Lamb Neck with smoked anchovy creme fraiche, gem lettuce and herbs.  I have been to their sister restaurant called Bavel which I had the lamb neck at.  I have to say I preferred Bavel's dish much more but this dish was still good.  It was a lighter dish as it is served with lettuce. Buttermilk Panna Cotta with roasted huckleberries and whole wheat butter cookies.  So creamy and delicious, I would definitely order this again. I would certainly recommend you try it and all their sister restaurants; Bavel and Saffey's as well.\", \"We came on a Friday at 5:30pm. We made a reservation a month in advance, but it was pretty empty at 5:30. The restaurant front is in an alley and there's no big sign that shows Bestia outside.  For appetizers, we ordered the chicken gizzards and bone marrow. For entree, we got the Spicy Lamb Sausage Pizza and the Squid Ink Pasta. Our favorite was the Spicy Lamb Sausage Pasta, the crust was crispy and the sauce has a spicy kick. I liked the Squid Ink Pasta and enjoyed that it was cooked to al dente, but my friend thought it was too salty.  Chicken gizzards and the bone marrow were underwhelming. The Bar au Chocolat Bittersweet Chocolate Budino Tart was okay.The service here is superb!There is a 4% service charge.Valet parking is in the alley $12. We found free street parking across the street.\", \"Been wanting to try Bestia for the longest time and finally got a chance to visit recently with some out of town friends. We had reservations for 830pm and only had to wait maybe 10-15mins to be seated on a Thursday night. The music indoor was a little too loud for so we opted for an outdoor table which was the move. They also had heated lamps but wasn't really needed as it was warm that night.We decided to do family style and ordered a few dishes for the four of us to share. We tried the following:Peruvian Scallop Crudo: 5/5 very refreshing! Great dish to start off dinner.Guanciale & Burrata pizza: 5/5 both were delicious. The crust was very tasty.Squid ink spaghetti: 1/5 Would not recommended. Very bland tasting compared to all the dishes.Chestnut & Mushroom Agnolotti: 5/5 Very flavorful and highly recommended!Duck: 5/5 Probably the best last dish we had. Very tender and flavorful.Service: 5/5 Server kept changing out our plates and utensils and kept our water filled.\", \"Amidst the romantic backdrop of Bestia's warm ambiance, my dining partner and I embarked on a culinary journey that left us with lasting impressions, earning this experience an overall 4-star rating.Food: 4/5We embarked on a culinary journey, starting with the Marinated Olives. These olives were a delightful opening act, impressively not overly salty, which allowed their natural flavors to shine.The Peruvian Scallop Crudo followed, and while it was undeniably delicious, the portions left us wanting more. The flavors were on point, but we wished for a more substantial serving.The Roasted Bone Marrow, served with gnocchetti, was a standout dish. The gnocchetti balanced the richness of the bone marrow beautifully, creating a harmonious blend of flavors and textures.The Spicy Lamb Sausage Pizza, while decent, didn't quite reach the heights of the other dishes. It was enjoyable but not exceptional.Cavatelli alla Norcina, featuring pork sausage and black truffle, was tasty, but again, the portion size left something to be desired. The flavors, however, were a testament to the kitchen's skill.Drinks: 5/5The Search and Destroy, a daiquiri-style cocktail, was a true highlight of the evening. It delivered on flavor, balance, and refreshment, making it a memorable drink.Dessert: 3/5We concluded our meal with the Strawberry Crostata, which was a unique dessert choice. While it didn't quite reach the level of amazement, it offered a pleasant and interesting conclusion to our dining experience.Service: 4/5The service at Bestia was attentive, and our server was knowledgeable about the menu. However, at times, there was a slight delay in getting our dishes, which prevented a perfect score.Atmosphere: 4/5The restaurant's atmosphere was vibrant and buzzing with energy, creating a lively dining environment. However, it was a bit on the noisy side, which may not suit those seeking a quieter dining experience.Overall: 4/5Bestia offers a compelling culinary journey with standout dishes like the Roasted Bone Marrow and the impressive Search and Destroy cocktail. While some portions were smaller than expected, and a few dishes fell short of amazement, the overall experience was positive. If you're looking for inventive cuisine and memorable cocktails in a lively setting, Bestia is worth a visit, especially for a romantic date night filled with flavor and flair.\", \"Finally had the chance to try this place after years of it sitting in my bookmarks. I may have had high expectations but really was expecting more. Breakdown of dishes and experience as follows:Food:- Scallops - this was our first and best dish. My wife and I were sitting right in front of the salad and cold foods section, eagerly watching the young lady meticulously put this dish together. The scallops were fresh and paired well with the coconut milk, micro greens, strawberry, and chili oil. - Herbs Salad - another great dish. This was a tower of greens with a healthy amount of tart dressing and shaved cheese. Just like the first dish, this resonated freshness. Bone Marrow - this was a disappointment. I was looking forward to this the most and was let down. When the dish is presented to you, the server scrapes the marrow out of the bone, onto a bed of spinach pasta. Personally, I really wanted to eat this right off the bone as this is part of the experience. I ordered bone marrow and not a pasta. Huge let down. - Spicy Lamb Pizza - a delicious pizza. The lamb was not gamey and the dough was very soft. The crust had a slight burn which added to the flavor as a whole. - Squid Ink Pasta w/ Lobster  - another disappointment. The pasta itself was not Al dented and the lobster had a very strong fishy taste to it. Both my wife and I left the lobster untouched which was unheard of. This place really needs to do better with their pasta dishes. Pork Loin - the pork tasted good and the bed of cabbage slaw was even better. This dish won't let you down. Overall, the food and dining experience was pleasurable but won't be rushing back anytime soon. A $300 bill for this could not be completely justified.\", \"Came here for my girlfriend and I's anniversary. Reservations are extremely hard to come by, so if you're looking at this place for a special occasion, I recommend you to book ASAP, even if it's a weeknight. You can always cancel a day beforehand, but make sure to secure your spot. Coming on a Tuesday night, I was surprised I could only reserve a time slot for 5:45PM.Now, is it worth the hype? If finances aren't an issue, definitely. Valet alone was $12, and you basically have to pay the fee if you plan on driving there. Is the place romantic? Heck no, this place is just a glorified busy restaurant. The noise levels are so loud that you have to raise you voice a good amount to be heard by someone across from you. I wouldn't be back here again to celebrate an anniversary - maybe a friends gathering or taking the in laws is more suitable. I would not consider coming back here -- definitely a novelty restaurant that can be checked off your list. Before a deep dive into their food, here are my recommendations:Bone Marrow - a must have for its delicious, juicy, flavorful taste. Cavatelli or Squid Ink Pasta - Best pasta you'll ever haveBranzino/Lamb - You have to order a secondiThe pizza is dismissable IMOAll the dishes are meant to be shared, which, as an Asian, felt really nice in a western restaurant.We ordered the Bone Marrow, Squid Ink Pasta, Branzino, Margarita Pizza, and a Search and Destroy cocktail. The Bone Marrow is a must have, simply due to how unique the flavor is. Although it came first as an appetizer, it definitely was the star of the entire course - the flavor is so hard to describe you'll just have to order it yourself. The Branzino is just a grilled bass that is seasoned to perfection - however it's hard to justify a grilled fish for $50. The Squid Ink Pasta packs a small punch due to the spice, but definitely one of the best pastas I've had in my life. The lobster was so soft and paired perfectly with the dish. The pizza was okay - I would definitely avoid their pizzas unless you absolutely want to order one. I think a pizza from Dominoes or Papa John's is better.Service was pretty good, our waiter cracked a few jokes and made us feel comfy. Keep in mind they have a surcharge which is revoke-able - only if you ask your waiter to prevent the charge. It's supposed to pay for the staff, but when you're selling a salad for $20, it's hard to justify that they need help paying their staff.Are the menu prices overpriced? Arguably so, but then again, you're going to a fine dining place recommended by thousands of people, so it's relatively justified. There are definitely some lowly practices here, but the food is definitely worth the visit.\", \"First time at Bestia and it was an interesting experience. The tables are pretty squished together and we were seated right in front of the kitchen. Runners and waiters were directly behind us (based on how we sat) so we felt a lot of movement and heat coming from the stoves. It's a very intimate and loud setting. You can't really hear yourself or the person next to you.Overall, the food was delicious but portions are extremely small. They recommend you order several dishes to share.\", \"Service wasn't great but the food makes up for it!Both the sommelier and our waiter were honestly kind of rude until the check arrived. We told the sommelier exactly what kind of wine our group wanted from the menu, but for some reason he didn't let us have it and brought out a wine that was twice the price. Similarly, I told our waiter we were deciding between two of the pasta dishes and he told us not to get either one of them... Just kind of rubbed me the wrong way that neither of the servers seemed to trust me enough to pick out my own meal!I could have had two of the bone marrow and the accompanying pasta all to myself. Warm, tender, and absolutely worth the hype. Will get this every time I'm here. The crust is usually my least favorite part of a pizza, but this spicy lamb pizza was a 10/10 from start to finish. Definitely more spice than I anticipated, but that's never a bad thing in my book. Cooked perfectly, soft and still flaky. I ended up going with the ricotta gnocchi, which I knew deep down was the right option, and I'm so glad I did . So cheesy and so soft. I don't know why the waiter would not recommend! Lastly we had to get some apple cider donuts to share. I'm not a huge dessert person but these may have changed that. Donuts AND donut holes, how could you refuse?All in all this totally would have been a 5 star review if both the waiters didn't rub me and my table the wrong way, but I'll certainly come back for more of that bone marrow\", \"I finally made it to Bestia and can't wait to go back to try more dishes from their menu. Nice ambiance, impeccable service and flavorful food. The mussels (not pictured) and salad were my favorite. Both packed with so much flavor. Each leaf in the salad was perfectly dressed. We had an early reservation so we were able to find street parking but they do provide valet.\", \"Honestly out of all the places I've been to, vacationed or eaten this is HANDS DOWN THE BEST! Nothing has come close to this place and I'm starting to think it NEVER will. After a concert family suggested this place...they said it had been years but still thought of it constantly. After savagely trying to get reservations we decided to drop by and see if they could accommodate. Thankfully they did, THANK YOU GOD! Upon sitting in our booth a super knowledgeable waiter come to our table to break down the menu. Considering the fact we were starving everything sounded appetizing. However this man was so detailed and passionate of the food he could literally sell us on the wine cork and we'd take it! We ordered 4 appetizers not all pictured but each and every one of them better than the last. Steak tartare flavorful, tender and fresh. Salumi thin cuts of meats paper thin melt in your mouth goodness. The shells, the most tender, fresh, coconuty and creamy delicacy I've ever tasted. The star of the show for appetizers in my opinion was the oh so simple perfectly balanced olives with a splash of lemon, olive oil and spices... my sister and I could not stop eating these. Seriously amazing! Next up the bone marrow green gnocchi 10/10 rich, buttery, nutty, and filling. Don't forget to ask for the bones to take home to you pup! The pizza 10 out of 10 it's thin and perfectly crisp with a slight char full of flavor. This is THE pizza I've dreamt of all my life. This would make my Nonno (Italian grandpa) proud. This meal was one of those meals you wish would never end. I dream of this place, the atmosphere, the vibe, the food, the drinks this place is the place. I wish I could gate keep  forever but that be unfair and everyone deserves to try heaven at least once.\", \"No way was I coming to Los Angeles and not trying Bestia (on every Eater/Zagat/Infatuation list!). I would recommend getting a reservation a few weeks in advance to get the best seating times. If you're coming in a car, there is valet service ($12?). My partner and I didn't initially try to look for parking nearby, but coming into the lot we didn't see a lot of street parking available. I would suggest eating the valet cost because it's pretty seamless in and out.Going into the restaurant, from the outside, it looks like you're going into a grungy warehouse where there's a secret underground club party (imagine fast and furious party warehouse). But when you actually go in, the space is beautiful with the overhead greenery and romantic rustic vibes. I felt like I was in a movie.I'm honestly a little upset that I didn't come here hungrier, because everything that we got here was so good. From the marinated olives, scallops, to the pizza, pasta, and dessert. The scallops were so fresh and sweet and paired with the creamy lemon, strawberries, and chili basil oil. I can confidently say these were the best scallops I've ever had in my life. We also ordered the lobster pasta with trout roe, chives (and also cooked with whisky!). The pasta was so good and so different from any pasta I've had (even though the portion is small, it's so worth it!). The dessert was also very memorable with the creamiest and lightest panna cotta I've ever had.Our server was very good with recommending us the pasta and he was also concerned that we weren't ordering enough food (reasonably so because we didn't come in super hungry). He was very attentive and checked in on us periodically during our meal.With the amazing ambiance, great service, and delicious food, it's no surprise that Bestia is on every best food list for Los Angeles. Bestia is definitely worth every dollar.\", \"Reservations are a must! Came here on a Monday night with a few girlfriends. We made reservations a few weeks in advanced. They do have valet out front for $12 I believe or metered/street parking a few streets down. This is the spot for a louder group. I don't think it would be comfortable for more than 4 people, definitely not good for an intimate quite night. The food here is always delicious, if I was just basing it off food it would be a 4.5! There are a few MUST TRY items including the Herb Caesar Salad and the Roasted Marrow Bone! those are to die for.  Pizza was also good but not on the level of the other items. I was debating on taking off 1 or two stars and I did have to pick two. One because it is beyond loud and tight in here. As you walk to your table expect to squeeze past other people. The second would be the lack of variation with the cocktails and then the lack of experience with the bar tenders. This place is meant for wine. Go for the wine! Lastly the prices are wild especially with the small portion sizes, and there is a random 4% charge that isn't explained.Definitely a spot that is worth a try as the food is quite tasty, but I am not in a hurry to come back. Overall 3.5 stars!\", \"What can I say about bestia that hasn't already been said? You definitely know why you're coming here and what you're getting. My personal favorite is to be seated at the bar - yeah the tables nice, but the bar is where you see all the magic happen. The cooks cooking and the line working. It's beautiful My favorites here is obviously the roasted bone marrow and cavatelli! So rich so flavorful so amazing. Sometimes I order 2 orders of each. I also love their pizzas and ask them for honey on the side and drizzle it all over the pizza and thank me layer!As always this place is perfect for ANY occasion. Make reservations ahead and enjoy\", \"When it comes to the quality and consistency, no one can beat Bestia. No matter what you order always everything is amazing. The restaurant is very loud and some customers yelling instead of talking but it's okay. Food and customer service is phenomenal.This time I wasn't sure what white wine I would wanna drink and the server was so nice to bring me a couple of samples so I could pick what I want and it was very helpful.\", \"The food is good and the ambience is always lively and loud. Lots of tables inside so the tables are all pretty squished together with not much walking space in the restaurant. Dined here for dinner recently with a party of 8 I believe, so we had to do their prix fixe menu. We also order two bottles of wine. Considering the tab came out to $2000, you would think the service would be a little better. It's understandable for them to not be doing their best when it's busy, but be prepared for larger parties if a reservation is expected that day. Still had to wait a while for our table to be ready even with a reservation. We had one female server that was friendly, but the rest were rude.We ordered the Caesar salad, beef tartare, roasted marrow bone, spicy lamb sausage pizza, Margherita pizza, Cavatelli alla Norcina, mussels, and lamb neck. The mussels come with bread and the flavor of the sauce was great. Margherita pizza was pretty oily and cheesy. Everything else was good. Would have given a four or five star review, but the service is lacking.\", 'Valet parking only unless you find street parking. Make a reservation online! Waited about a month or so to try this spot out and it was worth the wait. Everything was amazing except for the confit and duck legs it was my least favorite. Get the Cavatelli alla Norcina, truffle, sausage and ricotta dumplings definitely the perfect bite.', 'These are awe-inspiring dishes. The Beef Tartare is delicious. The Bone Marrow is overrated. The pizzas are delicious.Service is excellent and attentive. The price is a bit too much for the quantity of food.']\n",

      "Reviews: ['Went prior to zoo lights show. We were sat immediately, food was out quick.Food was great! Kid friendly, they gave our daughter a balloon. Teddy our waiter was very attentive and provided us with awesome service. Will continue coming here.', \"I am not one to complain, I literally never leave bad reviews but I was just so shocked I have to speak. Positives first, oh service was extremely fast. Out waitress was great and even suggested substitutions when I asked something be left off the dish. She was amazing. Bread pudding rocked as usual. However,I ordered a wedge salad, a favorite of mine and expected the typical cold iceberg lettuce chopped into 4ths and drizzled with ranch and blue cheese. However I was presented with soft and brown spotted Romanian lettuce leaves lazily thrown on top each other. I gave it a shot and as mentioned before the lettuce was soft and warm. It threw me for a ride cause a wedge salad is just so easy and I assumed everyone knew what it was supposed o look like. This was yesterday and I'm still thinking about it. Unrelated but my dad and brother ordered smash burgers and clearly normal not smashed burgers were served. I think they just like calling things names and not actually making the thing.\", \"Ambiance: The place is a vibe! Love the decor and cozy intimate atmosphere. Definitely a place to grab some drinks and hang out with friends or family. It was Christmas themed when I went and they go all out, very festive. Food: Funny, we enjoyed all the other dishes besides the burgers. Do yourself a favor and order the cheese fries with bacon jam. I would come back just for this. Like animal style fries from In n Out but 10x better. The burgers were ok. Not super memorable and wasn't a fan of how cold the burger was. I'm assuming the buns are preassembled and left out while the patties are made to order. The bread pudding was a great way to end the night though and was one of the best I've had! Maybe 2 scoops of ice cream would be a better ratio for the pudding. Service: This is where I had to dock a star. Service is almost nonexistent. Waiter was impatient and hard to flag down. When our food had options (fries or salad) our waiter didn't bother asking, same with different flavor options for the ice cream. He was already leaving our table when we weren't even finished ordering. Our waiter never had his full attention on us and would only lean over with his ear and then would go back to running away again. Our waters were not getting refilled, and we had to chase down our guy for the check too. Might be understaffed?\", \"Omg what a great experience this was! The servers were all so kind, especially Roger who gave us tips on the area and now the Morrison is part of our regular weekend activity thanks to him! We had the truffle burger and upgraded it with truffle fries and some of the best apple pie cider as well as sangria. There were Christmas decorations and they were so friendly about our two dogs that came with us! The only downside here is the parking, but if you can find parking nearby elsewhere it's a great vibe! This is the most dog friendly restaurant I think I've ever been to!\", 'I can definitely tell why this is a top rated restaurant in the LA area! I can say the vibe and the customer service make an experience here extra special. I love the decorations around that matches the season and holidays. Ryan, the bartender, has always been super welcoming and awesome to everyone that comes around! I can tell everyone loves him there. The rest of the staff from host to BOH is also just as awesome! They have a variety of food and drink items on their menu, including a special menu for the fur babies!! They have a big happy hour menu 12-6pm every day which have pretty great deals. They have both indoor and outdoor seatings available with TVs so it gets pretty packed on game nights!The only downside is parking which is very tight with very limited one way parking spots. There are street parking available but also limited in the evening times.', \"I love the Christmas decorations! This review is for Teddy, our server. He was great! Morrison is my favorite place in my neighborhood. My son loves it too. Today I tried the chili cheese fries (yum!) and Rudolph's Egg Nog (so cute!).\", \"Stumbled upon the cutest pub when I was in the area! Didn't know where to eat so I decided to take it to Yelp to take me somewhere and I saw this place with over 7k reviews! As soon as you walk in, you will be greeted with the most Christmas movie -esque decorations! I was so surprised with how different it looked on the inside than the outside. Definitely will be back soon to actually drink (was too hungover to drink today lol). Our waitress, Keely, was the sweetest ever! I would totally recommend this place to anyone ever in the area (or even if you're not in the area)! Also the Jumbo onion rings... they're actually JUMBOOOOO.\", \"Well, it didn't take long for us to return, did it.We had some friends spend the weekend with us and wanted to take them to Morrison as a special treat, given the decor and the menu -- a mixed group, many of whom are carnivores. Morrison didn't disappoint.I took more pictures, mostly to round out your ability to appreciate the vibes here. I do want to say, however, that the reception we got was not as warm and friendly as the first time. For some reason, even though the owner told us we could reserve a booth, the gal at the desk went out of her way to inform us that booths cannot be reserved, but that we were in luck and there was one available. Hmmm. Our server may have had a rough day as she ranged from smiling to not-so-much. I will hold back her name as who knows what people deal with and I do not want to take away from the overall impression I had the first time.The food, the atmosphere, the ease of parking on side streets off Los Feliz Boulevard and the clever, detailed decor are all 10s in my opinion. Give it a try, just be prepared to sit wherever available -- once again, they were packed the entire time we were there.  A great spot, a hidden gem.\", \"This spot was clean with a very busy staff. Let me just say , that ButterscotchBreadPudding is Fantastic!! See picture! So were the burgers with  fresh lettuce tomatoes and soft bun Yummy!...this place was Christmas cozy and we loved it. It's a must try for sure..Thank you !\", 'What a fun and exciting pub! The service is fantastic and the food/drink choices are endless. They really get into the spirit of Halloween, as every nook and cranny of the restaurant is covered in fun and spooky decor.It was a great place for a meal, but better place for a drink! Loved my experience here.', \"A+++++++++++ on every level! I just can't say enough about this place. They all treat us so wonderfully and make every time we go there special. Excellent service, excellent food and a wonderful happy hour menu. Drinks are delicious and the ambience is top-notch. Very very festive and you've got to try the specialty drinks. We had the gingerbread House and the espresso martini and they were just scrumptious. Thank you again! We feel like family :-)\", 'Thank you Nick. You were most patient with us!  The vibe and atmosphere of The Morrison really makes us happy!  This mystery beer promo you have going, AWESOME! whats the abv?  We enjoyed guessing the mystery beer and our lunch!  Happy holidays to the staff! You guys are the best!', \"The Morrison is absolutely GREAT. I have been here several times for Happy Hour. The appetizers were absolutely delicious. The cocktail drinks were refreshing. Especially the Horchatta Bread Pudding dessert  was out of this world. An absolute must when you are there.The customer service was exceptional. Teddy was our server when I visited. He is absolutely the greatest. A true professional. Very attentive. He ensured my friends and I had stellar experience. Promote this server!Morrison's ambiance was festive. I was amazed with all the holiday decorations. You can tell the owner and staff put some thought into  holiday decorations.  Overall, I can see why the MORRISON is YELPERS Favorite spot. This restaurant is AMAZING!\", 'Perfect Halloween themed restaurant to hit before the haunted Hayride! Decor was on point  and spooky! Halloween drink specials were also a fun addition to their regular menu and free bread pudding with a valid hayride ticket was icing on the cake. Our server, Dani, was extra attentive and made sure our drinks and food came out quickly. Will definitely come back soon!', \"Oh my goodness where do I start. The food was phenomenal, the service was exceptional, and the ambiance was so cozy and festive.Our server was Teddy and he was just a ray of sunshine. He was on top of everything. He gave us a rundown of the menu, presented options to us, was super accommodating for our little ones, and was just amazing to have around. The kiddos had an order of Mac'n'Cheese and the kids chicken tenders and fries. The adults had half a rack of bbq ribs and 'The One Burger'. We are so happy with the food and service we got. The parking was accommodating, you shouldn't have an issue finding a place to parking in the lot or on the street. The food was delicious and was brought out in a timely manner.I definitely would recommend The Morrison for a date night, friends night out, or even family dinner. Their menu has options for everyone; adults, kids, vegetarian, with a vast variety of beer on tap, and even holiday cocktails. I just left but I'm already excited to go back and take my friends there.A special thanks to Teddy for making our night extra special!\", \"I love this place and how it is festively decorated, hip and welcoming. We had such a fun Happy Hour here with my sister.  Dani took excellent care of us!My son smiled when he was offered a balloon. I liked my Black Smoke HH cocktail. The HH Smashburgers were delicious and the fries were perfect.  The brussel sprouts with hazelnuts was a surprise hit. And that BREAD PUDDING is my new favorite dessert.  We got it with the vanilla bean ice cream.  You gotta get it. Can't wait to come back. Ask for Dani; she had stellar recommendations.\", \"From the moment we walked in, Roger C. made sure our experience at Morrison was nothing short of spectacular. His attentiveness and prompt service truly set the tone for an excellent dining adventure. The food here consistently hits the mark, serving up deliciousness with every dish we've tried.Yes, the ambience is loud, but it perfectly matches the energetic vibe of this bustling pub. It's the kind of place where the lively chatter and the roar from the TVs showcasing various sports channels add to the excitement rather than detract from it.Speaking of which, for sports enthusiasts like myself, having my favorite team on display while enjoying my meal was a big plus. And let's talk about cleanliness - the restrooms are spotless, giving patrons confidence that the kitchen upholds the same high standards.To top it off, the alcoholic beverages are a blend of strength and flavor, crafted by someone who knows their way around a bar. Overall, Morrison nails it with great food, a vibrant atmosphere, and exceptional service, especially from Roger C. It's a spot I'd recommend again and again for a hearty meal and a good time\", 'Fantastic Find in LA - Morrison!Had an amazing time at Morrison in LA! The Spicy Chicken Wings and Buffalo Wings were bursting with flavor, and the Smash Burger with fries was simply divine. But the highlight was our waiter, Keith, who provided the best customer service - attentive, friendly, and made our experience extra special. Definitely a must-visit spot for great food and even greater service!', \"Morrison never disappoints! My friend was craving a burger so figured to go here. There was a chips and guac deal for $6.50 which was a huge steal given the portion and the chips were thick. The guac would've been better if it was smashed more. Dani was super accomodating and friendly. She made sure and followed up with her team so we can watch the Laker game. She was fast and friendly at the same time. You absolutely cannot go to this place without their butterscotch bread pudding. It came out super warm with a delicious crust. The ice cream has sctual vanilla bean it all complimented by the caramel sauce. Tip is to park in the streets because their parking is narrow and always packed. We went a week before halloween, and they went all out with the decor!\", 'Great food. Great service. Nick was the best. I ate too much and had 3 reils of coke! Plus the Christmas decorations are worth a visit']\n",
