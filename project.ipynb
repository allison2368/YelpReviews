      "Reviews: ['Went to Bottega for a date night and let me tell you it was amazing. Had a reservation so did not have to wait long, once seated the waiter attended to us right away and we were able to order. Food is amazing and so fresh! Drinks were good too. Highly recommend for a cute little date night.', \"Everything was great! Food, menu options, staff & vibe. It's nice to have a traditional Italian restaurant that isn't stuffy or way over priced\", 'We had an amazing experience at Bottega! The food was delicious and the service was exceptional! We tried several dishes and none of them disappointed! I would highly recommend and I will definitely be returning!', \"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Bottega Restraint and I must say, it was an extraordinary experience.As for the food, every dish was a work of art. The presentation was impeccable, and each bite was bursting with flavor. From the appetizers to the desserts, every course exceeded my expectations. The menu showcased a combination of classic and innovative flavors, showcasing the chef's culinary expertise.\", \"Bottega surprisingly had dishes that seemed unique to other italian restaurants I've been to. The interior was pretty dark and they actually have these table lamps that they turn on for you, with just a bit of ambiance on the ceilings and walls. I got a seat with my two friends in the back corner so I didn't have too much incentive to look around. It was the day before Thanksgiving so maybe we got really lucky with the timing and managed to get a seat. By the time we were done, the restaurant was about to fill up.Their complimentary bread is very good. If I go to a restaurant and I enjoy their bread, it speaks volumes from my perspective. They have dried tomato in some of the pieces which adds a light kick. Olive oil on the side if thats your thing.I got the salmon fettuccine and it was pleasantly soft to bite into the salmon. Most of the time I get a salmon dish at italian restaurant, I often get displeased that the fish has been cooked too long. Then again, not my recipe. They add this sauce which they refer to as 'pink' and I'd say it makes the whole dish creamier. Not too bland, and not too overpowering. Really enjoyed it. I didn't try the other dishes but I didn't even recognize that my friend got ravioli so A+ for how their dishes stand out! The two tables next to me had my head turned every so often to look at the dish they ordered.I'd say if you are in the area and are craving some italian food, definitely try this spot out! I'd come again on a date for sure. The service here is excellent as well since they often come to check up on you.\", \"This place is a solid 4.5 with a perfect experience and good food! They don't take reservations, so it's usually just a wait, but luckily on a Sunday night, there was no wait. Sara was our waitress and was very nice, and she knew all about the food, joked around, and gave us good recommendations. The atmosphere is darker and intimate, but also very lively despite not having a wait, so it was definitely a place that people seem to enjoy! I have been here before, but did enjoy it the first time so wanted to try it out again (looks like I forgot to review this place the first time!)They gave complimentary bread as starters, and you could easily get lost finishing it while waiting for your food. Not sure how fresh the bread actually is, but it was buttered and warm. We ordered the Sacchetti and the Quattro Formaggi Roman pizza, and I was so surprised that this place actually split the pasta into two dishes for you to share! The Sacchetti is unlike anything I have tried before, and would say it is one of the dishes to try here to see what it's like. They are like tortellini/ravioli filled with cheese with hints of sweetness like pear, and then with some walnuts to add a sense of earthiness and crunch. It fills your mouth with all textures and flavors, and really does feel like a balanced pasta dish even though the ingredients are so simple! The Roman pizza was also very nice, a great amount of cheese but still with distinct flavors from the different cheeses they use. For dessert, we got the Tiramisu which I thought the cream was great, but just felt on the dryer side as it felt like the lady fingers could have been soaked more like you would have for a classic tiramisu. Last time I came here, I remember getting a pink sauce pasta, but that was on the tangy side and not something that I really remember, so I need to try it again next time I come to give a proper review of it. But the portion sizes were good and the service was great!Overall I think this is a solid modern Italian place in SF! I think the food and atmosphere is great to continue to visit again and again, and I don't think I'll find a dish like the Sacchetti anywhere else!\", 'First night in the bay and pasta sounded like a great idea. This place was so lively and fun and turned our ordinary Thursday into Thirsty Thursday. We ordered various pasta dishes and appetizers and they were all a bit smaller in size than we would have preferred, but still delicious nonetheness. Our waiters were so lovely, accomodating, a genuine joy to be around. I would definitely come back and recommend this spot for a lively atmophere.', \"This is truly a beautiful restaurant with gorgeous pink hues and floral accents.The complimentary bread, a rare treat nowadays, was quite good. Our waiter made ordering our meals such a breeze by offering  insightful recommendations. I opted for the Mezzemaniche Boscaiola with pink sauce, it was so delicious! The staff's thoughtful gesture of singing Happy Birthday for my friend's birthday and presenting a complimentary panna cotta added a thoughtful and sweet touch to the overall experience.\", 'I highly recommend a daytime visit to Bottega to immerse yourself in its enchanting interior, featuring captivating pink hues, wood finishes, rose gold accents, cascading flowers, and exposed brick--a perfect backdrop for dressing up and capturing beautiful moments.The food was yummy, and my friends enjoyed their meals too. I ordered garlic bread which was perfectly seasoned -- not too much, or too little. I also enjoyed my gnocchi with pesto sauce.  The pesto sauce was made into a perfectly creamy blend and not oily/greasy. Gnocchi can oftentimes be a rich and heavy dish, but they somehow made it light. The service was kind, and attentive. My water glass was always full. We were regularly offered refills of complimentary bread, and this bread was so soft, warm, and flavorful. It was a highlight on its own for me. Additionally, the wait staff surprised me with a happy birthday song, and panna cotta with a candle. Sooo thoughtful, and brought a smile to my face. Thank you!', \"I mean... come on, if you walk pass this place, you are instantly sucked in by the open concept giving you a full view of their bar and alcohol selection with the aromas of delicious food being cooked and served. Bottega has always been recommended by my coworkers so I had an opportunity to take the family a few weeks back. Nicky, our server, was so welcoming by treating us like we were regulars. She made recommendations, told us the special of the day, and also took note of our daughter's food allergies. Kids were being basic yet again, ordering a pasta with butter and another one with meatballs. My wife and I shared calamari fritti, lasagna and they were kind enough to split the branzino for us. Food was fantastic with the branzino being the highlight of our dining experience. Fish was cooked to perfection, capers and potatoes were a nice touch, and everything was seasoned perfectly! I would come back just for this!Cocktails were tasty and beautiful... solid wine selection as well! Thank you Nicky for making us feel so welcomed!\", 'No Fees', \"Ordered to go on Yelp so unsure of ambiance. Delivered fast. I did the build your own pasta. I did the rigatoni with garlic, chicken, and pink pasta. The pasta was Al dente for sure. Barely taste the garlic: chicken was dry. Pink pasta sauce taste store bought like or like frozen food. The second one was the Ravioli, garlic, mushroom, onion, Italian sausage, and bolognese sauce. Ravioli is good. Didn't see any onions and i paid extra, barely 4 slices piece of mushroom and paid $2 extra, no garlic flavor,  but there was a lot of Italian sausage pieces. Sausage is bland. The sauce basically taste like spaghetti O ravioli sauce the one you can buy at Walmart. Most likely would never order from here again. Doesn't taste fresh, authentic, or has much flavor. Didn't come with utensils, so make sure to ask for it.\", \"This is my favorite place to get pasta in the city or to order on DoorDash! It's so aesthetic, perfect for dinner out with the girlies or date night. Depending on when you come, there may or may not be a wait. There is an option to add yourself onto the Yelp waitlist remotely which is convenient. We always get wine to pair with our dinner. My two go-to pastas are the:*amatriciana: the spicy tomato sauce with the guanciale is so good; the perfect combination of spiciness with warm pasta*mezzemaniche boscaiola with pink sauce: the pink sauce is so creamy and flavorfulParking wise, it can be a little difficult to find street parking. There's also metered parking all around. It's overall a cute spot in the mission to try out!\", 'good simple Italian fare with solid pastas and pizzas. no gimmicks needed, just the type of place you and a few friends would enjoy sunday dinner together family style.  Amatriciana was the standout here, no pancetta substitute here, guanciale all the way!Food: 8/10Value: 8/10Service: 7/10Vibe: 8/10', \"The ambience here is so great for a date night or a night out with friends. I ordered the truffle ravioli with burrata salad. Let me just say the truffle ravioli had me coming back for more the following weekend. It's now one of my go to pastas. Also, need to mention that they serve complimentary homemade focaccia?! im obsessed. A must try if you're in SF!\", \"Delicious Italian off mission street! Their whole menu looked yummy so it was tough choosing. Went with the lasagna and wasn't disappointed. The first bite was so cheesy and scrumptious and brought a smile to my face. They also give you complimentary bread which was an awesome great. Love this place!\", \"Came out for a much-needed date night and Bottega was the perfect spot to go to. First off, the decor is amazing. Florals everywhere and a cute neon pink sign, it meets the needs for both girl brunch and romantic date night. We chose a seat by the open window so we could enjoy the warm weather and people-watch during our meal. For the food, we started off with the burrata alla caprese which is essentially just a caprese salad but with burrata instead of mozzarella cheese. Very creamy and refreshing, a nice way to start off the meal. They also bring out complimentary house focaccia throughout the meal which is buttery, soft, and savory. For my main, I decided to get the gnocchi with the bolognese sauce while my husband opted for the sacchetti. My meal was definitely the heavier and filling of the two - they don't skimp on the portion of pasta and the meat sauce is rich on its own. While my husband's meal portion is probably not enough to fill up someone who is pretty hungry, the dish itself was fantastic. I'm normally not a fan of blue cheese, but the combo of blue cheese, pears, and walnuts was spot on. The dish comes in a white cream sauce which pairs very well with the other flavors on the plate. A must-try. Even when I'm full after my meal, I'm a sucker for whatever dessert item looks unique. Here, it was the limoncello mascarpone cake. I was a little worried it would be too much on the lemony side, but the lemon flavor was actually just the right amount. Mixed in with the fluffy cake and the creamy mascarpone, this was the absolute perfect, refreshing yet satisfying dessert to end our meal. Bottega is a must-try! Looking forward to our next visit.\", \"everything was great, big portions, great taste, two dishes of 30$ came out to 60$ and not 100$ like in every other restaurant. Even got a free pannacota for my girlfriend's birthday and they sang happy birthday. I cannot say about many places that I will come again, but definitely will come to this place again in the future.\", \"I came here for dinner with a party of four around 7:30pm on a weekday and were able to get seated really quickly! I loved the decoration inside but it did feel noisy and was hard to hear my friends talk sometimes. We ordered an appetizer, two pastas, and a pizza to share which ended up being the perfect amount for all of us. Both pastas (mezzemaniche boscaiola and gnocchi) were good except the texture of the noodle was too firm for my preference. The flavors overall were great though! The bruschetta and margherita pizza were also fine but didn't really stand out to me compared to the pastas.\", \"Wow. That was soooo amazing. The chicken Parmesan was perfect. The salmon Alfredo sauce was great, salmon cooked perfectly. Also you can't skip the lemon cake. Perfectly balanced, not too sweet\", \"I remember ordering Bottega during the pandemic and I wasn't happy about it. I didn't rate it at the time because I don't think it's fair to rate any spot solely for take out so I decided to stop in today while I was in the Mission. At first sight, I was very impressed with the decor. There were flowers everywhere and it seemed like we were transported to a garden in Europe. The ambiance was 5/5. The food however was lackluster. The focaccia bread tasted stale. You could tell the pasta was made in house, but still something was missing. The size and shape are atypical of what you would normally expect for pasta especially the spaghetti noodles. I was excepting a chow mein type noodle but was given a fettuccine type--this is just my personal preference but it threw off my experience. The rigatoni in the arrabbiata sauce was my favorite.\", 'No Fees', \"Their Friday and Saturday night hours extend to midnight now! Super lively energy even late at night (it's hard to find food spots open after 10pm in SF). Good vibes for parklet seating and indoor tables too Ordered the prosciutto burrata pizza in person for takeout, and it was really easy and only took 10 minutes for them to make! Came with red pepper and Parmesan on side.Pizza is a nice focaccia texture, more of a hefty bready bite flatbread but still soft/chewy. Burrata was so creamy. I thought there could have been more flavor outside of a saltiness, like a fruit, pesto, or pepper accompany the toppings.Would likely come back to try their pasta next time and get cocktails if with friends.\", 'Tried Bottega for dinner for the first time. The decor is really cute and I can see it looking amazing in the day time as well. We got the vegetarian croquettes which tasted really good and went well with the sauce. All of us got pastas and to be honest, we thought they were too al dente. The pastas were pretty thick and heavy so might have been a good idea to get something lighter along with the pasta. But this place looks like a great spot for celebrating special occasions and everyone was nice overall.', \"We came in for a weekday dinner. We were able to call shortly before coming, and had a table reserved for our group of 8. The inside is super cute and there's a good amount of seating. It's also spacious so it doesn't feel cramped at all. We each got a pasta and some apps to try. We really enjoyed whatever we got, and the pasta portions were super reasonable. Will definitely come again.\", 'Be ready to become transported to Italy when entering. We came on a weekday afternoon, and luckily no wait. Very cute and trendy ambiance. So nice to take pictures of. Our servers were quick and food came out not too long afterwards Everything was so delicious. Craving their pasta as we speak. A must try in the city.', \"The ambiance here is spectacular and so is everything else! My friends and I grabbed some drinks at the bar while we waited to get seated for our party of 5. It was a Monday, so we got a table fairly quickly. What I tried:* Garlic Bread - This usually comes with 4 pcs, but our waiter added 1 more since we had 5 people. Such an amazing simple appetizer!* Crab Cakes - I'm usually not a huge fan of crab cakes, but these were great. They had a nice crunchy exterior but the crab meat was not dry and had a great flavor. * Amatriciana - The pasta was perfectly cooked and smothered in this delicious spicy tomato sauce. I personally wouldn't have minded a little more spice but it was amazing still. * Gnocchi in Ragu sauce - The gnocchi was so fresh and basically melted in your mouth. Would definitely come here again to try it with all of the different sauce options. Going to be adding this spot to my favorites and will be coming back again soon!\", 'We stopped in for some drinks and a few appetizers. The pomodori and funghi bruschetta were very tasty. The toasts were a great size. We also got the croquettes and they were probably my favorite. The drinks were just ok!', \"I'm glad to say that Bottega lives up to its hype and isn't just for the aesthetics! If you're ever craving pasta, Bottega is the the place to be.SERVICE (1000/10): My mom and I loved our server Nicky! She radiates such a beautiful aura which went hand in hand with our first time experience at Bottega. I also do remember her vibing to Mama Mia with the table next to us. Truly iconic! Learning our preferences, mine was wanting a nice creamy pasta while my mom was craving something with seafood-- she was able to recommend 2 solid dishes. We ended both ended up getting the Pomodori Bruschetta for our appetizer, Sweet Dreams mocktail, along with the Mezzemaniche Boscaiola with Pink Sauce and the Pasta special for our entree. FOOD (8.5/10):- Bruschetta Pomodori: had a nice crunch to it, it was good but we've definitely had better. - Mezzemaniche Boscailo and Pasta special was truly delicious and didn't disappoint! I could say that the pasta was fresh and cooked to perfection, the portions filled up and these both were packed with so much flavor! Sweet Dreams mocktail: Personally loved this drink so much, it kinda reminds me of an Orange creamsicle but in liquid form. So good! Delicious food and reasonable prices is what we all love! AMBIANCE (10/10): - So cute, clean and beautifully decorated! Perfect for a date night or brunch with the girls. Overall, I would say it was worth it and definitely be back.Side note: Parking is super limited due to it being street parking! Thankfully it wasn't an issue for us!\", \"An amazing Italian spot with delicious food and great service. We were a bit worried about the long wait on Friday night as they don't accept reservations, but thanks to the really effective work of the hostess we were seated in 10 minutes after arriving. The ambiance of the place and the service during our dinner was great as well. We went with salmon fettuccine and eggplant parmigiana and really enjoyed our plates. Portions were generous and sauce's just delicious. I also liked the Valencia Dream cocktail - gin based with a fresh note of strawberry is a perfect combination. So our overall experience at this place was very good and i definitely recommend it to everyone who is looking not only for delicious Italian food but also for the ambience\", \"Amazing! We wanted a good meal after attending an event and was happy to have discovered this place as a late night eatery. So glad I found it on Yelp because it did not disappoint! We arrived around 10pm on a Saturday night and was able to grab a seat instantly. They have indoor or outdoor seating, we chose inside. The ambiance is super cute with the pendant lights and floral decor. Even the dining chairs were cute. For drinks I ordered a sparking rosè. It was perfect, not too sweet, not too brut. To start we shared a ceasar salad. We told them that we wanted to share and they split it for us on two separate plates! That was super helpful and we definitely made note. I ordered the black truffle mushroom ravioli. It was great!!! I'm glad the hosts provided me with an idea on how good it would be. His recommendation did not disappoint. The flavor of the truffle was strong, which I like! The mushrooms were minced and paired good with the sauce and truffle. Highly recommend! Overall I will be dining here again for sure. Parking is limited to street but luckily I didn't have any issues finding one close by.\", \"Really great service and amazing food. Came here for my friend's birthday dinner and it was perfect choice for yummy Italian. Prices are affordable and portions are adequate. They gave her a complimentary tiramisu which was a nice and thoughtful touch.\", 'No Fees', \"Came with my girls for a girls night out. I had checked here on yelp and it said they don't take reservations, but when we got there they said they do take reservations. So maybe its a case by case? But lets get too it, the location has terrible parking so be prepared or take a ride share. but the restaurant is super cute! love the summer italy look of pink, pastel flowers every where.I opted for the pesto gnocchi, and the girls all got the lobster ravioli, it was table favorite, and i dont blame them. We had lots of bread, salad and the burrata ( a must have in my opinion)lastly we had the tiramsu for dessert and it was so creamy and delicious.Definitely a must try.\", \"This place is so pretty, from the outside to the inside. We went and there was no wait, not many people seated. However, the service was great, I had chicken parmesan which is my favorite dish, SUPER good, I loved it, my husband had salmon pasta, he wasn't a big fan, but thats okay. We love to try new places. We had dessert and omg it was so good, I don't remember the name (look at pictures). Overall we liked this place. PS they have a huge pepper grinder lol\", 'I loved everything about this place :) we went with friends without a reservation and were immediately seated, so that was the first win! Friendly service, gorgeous ambiance and amazing decor. it has seating indoor and outdoor.In $130 (before tip) we got:- free bread 3/5 for the table with condiments . I would save my calories for main course- eggplant pasta which we customized to add grilled chicken and make the sauce spicy 5/5- vegana pizza - 4.5/5 - loaded with veggies and just the perfect amount of cheese and crispy !!- calamari 5/5 - loved that it came with some veggies in it and made fresh not oily calamari with a yummy pink dip- virgin mojito - skip it- valencia dream cocktail 4/5  - pink gin based yummy- sweet dreams - 5/5 sweater and the best one i liked- sunset cocktail - 4/5Sadly, the big black pepper (star of the restaurant) was broken and the new one was to come in by next weekend. Its still in the store so we saw it but not in usePS- they dont have air conditioning in the indoor seating just so u know!Clean cutlery and tables, full bar and chic seating. Definitely coming back for more. I think i will try their tiramisu next time.. stay tuned and \"Meet me at bottega\"', \"The service: 10/10.  The ambiance: 10/10.  Food: 6/10. I've been dying to try out this spot for so long (the IG videos really got me hyped up for it).  I don't regret trying it because it was such a cute little spot, the vibes were really immaculate! With that said, I definitely don't think the food was THAT great.  The bruschetta was good, not amazing but pretty tasty.  I absolutely LOVE anything with truffle in it, but the mushroom ravioli was just alright - the black truffle sauce was very thick but sadly didn't have much of that truffle flavor that I was expecting.  The pesto was the exact opposite -- very runny and a complete lack of flavor. I don't even think the pasta had any salt in it, let alone any other spices.  We had to ask for something spicy like chili flakes just to add some sense of flavor. Also, the music was SO freaking loud at this restaurant. On a Tuesday evening. At 6:30pm.  I literally found myself shouting across the table to talk to my friend.  There's really nothing I hate more than loud club music at a cozy restaurant -- it just doesn't make any sense conceptually.  Anyways, not sorry that I tried this spot but I don't know if it was worth the hype.  I might be back to try a pizza of theirs someday, but I'm in no rush to return.\", \"The service here was excellent. The vibes are trendy. The food? Average at best. Calamari appetizer was tasty but nothing special. Had some rigatoni pasta that was too al dente. The arrabiata sauce is good but added some additional spice. Wouldn't fully recommend but if you're in a pinch this spot will do.\", 'This was such a beautiful restaurant! It got pretty noisy as me and more people arrived for dinner so having conversations was a bit challenging. However, that was the only con. The staff were wonderful and attentive. The food was satisfying and portions were great! I asked for recommendations on wine paring and was not disappointed. Would definitely return to try more menu items.', '- Calling this my #1 favorite Italian restaurant- Friendliest and most attentive staff- Seats available inside and outside the restaurant- Dishes appear small, but it is filling- What is that amazing spicy sauce?- Walking distance from the 24th Mission street BARTI have tried a few Italian restaurants before, but none has truly given me a wonderful experience like this one. Actually, I\\'ll compliment further, this was the best restaurant experience I ever had from any food category. The staff were the best at sharing us recommendations, special menus of the day, clearing the plates and tables, checking in from time to time to ask us if we are doing great, every aspect was so lovely.We arrived at the restaurant to have a delicious and good time, and Bottega delivered. I would like to give the rating 10+ stars if I could.Bottega has been in my bookmarks since I first saw the restaurant while walking around Valencia street. I love the warm and pretty interior decorations of flowers and the soft pink colors. I always recall the restaurant filled with people, so we decided to get there as early as possible. We entered 30 minutes after it opened and there were more seats than I last recall from my last visit in Valencia street. Along with tables, bar side tables, there is also outdoor seating.The staff welcomed us and asked whether we wanted to sit inside or outside, and we opted for inside. The view from the inside is so pretty! The light from the outside is just right amount to filter through the tall windows. The staff handed us a menu; the front side is the food and the other side was the alcoholic drinks. I did wonder, hm, where is the coffee and the dessert, but that was well orchestrated by Bottega.While we were deciding, the staff mentioned about a special menu of minestrone soup or the pork chop, and we were intrigued with the minestrone soup. We ordered three dishes the Amatriciana, the prosciutto pizza (saw this from yelp photos), and the minestrone soup. As the food was being prepared, the staff asked if we were planning to share the dishes, and explained the unbelievably long pepper grinder we witnessed from a different guest.The minestrone arrived first and then the Amatriciana pasta. The staff came by and asked if we wanted more cheese, pepper, or the spicy sauce on the side. We asked for the spicy sauce on the side -- and yes, we needed to ask for more pepper. The pepper grinding was so cool and fun to stare at. xD I have a pepper grinder at home, but this one was almost as tall as a young child. Where did they sell these?The minestrone soup was very smooth and rich with flavor. My relative, who loves dishes with vegetables, praised this a lot and really enjoyed this soup. The vegetables in the broth were cooked so well, so soft, that light bites were enough. I might have wished we ordered another bowl, so we\\'ll keep that in mind for next time.I was blown away with the spicy sauce when paired with the Amatriciana. What is that magic? There is a drastically amazing difference when tasting the pasta before adding the spicy sauce versus after. Before, it is good, but it also felt hefty. I sprinkled a little bit of the spicy sauce, and all of the sudden the flavors elevated and the dish became refreshing? It was like a magic transformation. Also, despite calling it the spicy sauce, it wasn\\'t spicy even for me, who has low spice tolerance. The pasta noodle was cooked al dente, so there was an evenly smooth chew on each bite. The prosciutto pizza arrived while we were still eating and being amazed by the Amatriciana and the minestrone soup. It was cut in 8 pieces and each slice has prosciutto, cheese, and a cream that was particularly my favorite. It was milky and balanced out the salt from the prosciutto. On the first bite, I first tasted the salt, but it evened out in the end of the meal. Due to how thin the prosciutto is, this one was the hardest to eat out of the others. Prosciutto is not an easy piece to eat.We were feeling full, when the staff handed a petite dessert menu. Now, before this arrived, I told my family that if they offer me a dessert I will say \"yes,\" So, yes, we ordered dessert. Here, the staff explained the different desserts and pointed out the staff\\'s favorite. I decided to go for the staff favorite, which was the third one in the list, after the panna cotta. (I tried my best to look by the search engine but I couldn\\'t remember what it was called). We also ordered the panna cotta.The panna cotta was so good, the cream is so milky and melt into the mouth. I loved it a lot. Strawberry puree covered the top and the slightly sour and sweet strawberry complimented perfectly with it. Man, it was crazy because we were full moments ago, but the heaviness disappeared the moment we took a bite of the desserts.I also loved the other dessert. It is slightly heavier than the panna cotta, and I love the yellow custard.Yelp told me I\\'m at my word limit.', 'I\\'ve been wanting to try this restaurant after seeing/hearing lots of great reviews. It\\'s super cute and serves up many IG worthy pictures. Parking is obviously street parking. They have outdoor and indoor seating options. I was able to walk in without reservations. Love that they keep a wait time posted on their yelp. You can add yourself to the waiting list before arriving.They serve complimentary focaccia break that you can dip in olive oil. The bread was alright but I always appreciate complimentary bread. I ordered the ravioli stuffed with mushrooms in a black truffle creme sauce. It was divine!! The pasta was perfectly cooked and the sauce was decadent! Would totally order it again. Unfortunately, our waiter wasn\\'t very friendly. He gave off moody \"I hate my job\" vibes. After handing my friends and I our dishes he quickly dashed off while I was mid sentence and never checked on us. We had to hunt down someone else for chili flakes and the check. Regardless of the service I would return and probably try their pizzas next! They sound delish.', \"Service was great! Came in a group of 12 at opening time and there was almost no wait (5-10 mins). They gave us a private room upstairs so long as we cleared out in 3 hours since there had been a reservation. During our time there, the restaurant filled up pretty fast but we got our food in a timely fashion and there was always water and bread at the table. However, I was not the biggest fan of the food. Bread was meh the first round and a little on the drier end, but subsequent rounds were better. I don't like brussel sprouts at all but their brussel sprout appetizer might have been my favorite thing. The lobster ravioli was too sweet and a bit too fishy for me. The salame pizza was on the saltier end, and the amount of oil pooling up in the toppings made me uncomfortable. I had bites of some other people's pasta and it was better (pasta with pink sauce and veggies, pasta with white truffle sauce, etc.).PS: parking is really hard to find on Valencia street. We parked at a garage near Dolores and walked over.\", 'First time here and looking to try their pasta dishes after looking at thru reviews. Their cocktails were really good and the pasta dishes were as expectedly delicious. They serves focaccia bread when you arrive and they were super soft to dip in olive oil. Their decor were super trendy and their service were attentive and friendly.  They are pretty close to 24th Mission Bart station if you want to arrive through public transit.', 'No Fees']\n",

Great spot!', \"Ambience was amazing 10/10 so classy clean modern, service was very welcoming, fast and beautifully put together, best of all the food I had was delicious, I orders the filet mingon best steak I've had\", \"I live just around the corner in Marina and wanted to try this new spot. Don't let the lack of guests inside steer you away (it's brand new) -- This food was EXCELLENT. Some of the best I've had along Chesnut Street. And the servers were incredibly attentive and kind.\", \"Excellent service!! Came here for my birthday with a group of friends. I highly recommend this restaurant. The crew sang happy birthday for me and provided a yummy dessert. The food was amazing! I had the grilled salmon. They also have a huge selection of wine. Alina and Berry served us and they were wonderful. The ambiance is very nice and classy. It's perfect for a birthday dinner where you can dress up and take pictures after.\", \"It was such a great experience! Seems like they just opened a few weeks ago, and we would highly recommend! Everything from decor to food to service to location and the restrooms were on point. We sat outside, and it was the most beautiful sunny day to dine outdoors. Esvet was so awesome! We got the beef meatballs, linguini, beet salad and key lime pie. I hear the pie is a 20yr old recipe, and it definitely didn't disappoint. Soooo yum! Coming back for the bread pudding next.\", \"Wonderful restaurant and experience in the Marina.  Ambience is great (although it is a bit noisy - just FYI).  Very pretty restaurant with comfortable chairs and great location!Service was impeccable!  Everyone was extremely nice, servers were attentive and the timing was perfect.Food was very good.  We started with the prawn appetizer, I had the salmon and Mr. had the linguini.  Judging by the way he scarfed that down, I would say it was a winner!  Salmon was good along the yummy vegetables served with it.  The prices are not bad either.  Most entrees are in the 20-30.00 range.  The starters and salads are less than 20.00.  Next time I would love to try their beet salad and skirt steak so we'll be back!\", \"We happened to be walking by looking for a lunch spot this Sunday and noticed this new beauty! They opened two weeks ok just off Chestnut street on Steiner. The gorgeous interior decor and furniture  caught my eye. We essentially ordered the entire starter menu minus the prawns . The most delicious item was (allegedly) a butternut squash gnocchi, but tasted more like a delicious Alfredo to me! Pasta was cooked perfectly. Wish I didn't have to share it ;pThe boys really enjoyed the steak tartare despite and exorbitant amount of cheese on it. The calamari was sadly inedible- super dry and cheery. Berry our awesome server kindly removed it from our bill on her own. Burrata heirloom salad was good! Just feel like plating should be reconsidered. Each tomato slice was pretty huge and somewhat awakes to cut. Meatball was a hit as well, delicious sauce. They serve wine and beer as well and I could not stop loving the flower ceiling we had outside. For just their second week up and running, they nailed it. Will definitely return!\", \"We had a great time at Bagatella for dinner. The restaurant is beautiful inside, and our server was friendly and attentive. To start, they provide complimentary house-made bread with truffle butter. We ordered the steak tartare, broccolini, pan seared chicken breast, and seafood linguini. Everything was delicious, but the standout was the steak tartare, which was some of the best we've had in the city. We will definitely be back for that dish alone. They also provided a key lime pie on the house for dessert, which was such a nice touch and a very delicious end to the meal. This definitely a great date night spot, and somewhere I'd take friends for a more intimate dinner.\", \"Ambiance is super cute, great for lunch and/or date nights. The staff is very accommodating and attentive, they will keep your glass filled and your stomach full. Food is delicious, I had the penne chicken (not pictured because I got hungry), everyone enjoyed the roasted chicken, salmon, and the steak. Everything's was cooked to perfection, you can tell that this business truly cares and they check on you to make sure that you're well taken care of. I'll definitely be back with friends, family, dates. Thank you for hosting our party and making it a great experience for us!\", \"Title: A Culinary Gem in SF Marina - Bagatella Shines Bright!Review:From the moment I stepped into Bagatella, the new culinary sensation in SF Marina, I knew it was going to be an extraordinary experience. It wasn't just a meal; it was a journey through exquisite flavors and aromas.

The service is amazing. From the host, to the server, to the owner they're all very kind, friendly and personable! The ambience is unbelievable. Truly an instagrammable restaurant!! We started with a beet salad, burrata and heirloom tomato and steak tartare! By far the best steak tartare I have ever had!! Must try!!! My favorite starter was the Gnocchi!!! It's a must try!!! I had the spaghetti meatballs *chefs kiss* as the entree and my friend had the filet mignon! The filet mignon was cooked to perfection!!! For dessert we had tiramisu, key lime pie and crème brûlée!

One of the best dining experiences I have had in a long time! I plan to come back here very soon can't wait to try everything on the menu!\", \"Our server Esvet is a legend, bubbly personality and extremely sweet to our puppies. We sat outside with 2 dogs & ordered 3 sides of grilled chicken for them. For the humans we shared the meatballs, the sauce was just perfect. Sweet and seasoned to perfection. They also served warm bread with yummy truffle butter. I had the seafood linguini and he had the special sacchetti pasta.

The ambiance is superb, with indoor and outdoor seating. The food was amazing and the service was fantastic. We got the Steak Tartare and Burrata as an appetizer along with Skirt Steak as an entree. Special thanks to Dave & Abe for their amazing service. The evening was everything we hoped it would be. I highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely be coming back.', \"Agree with all previous reviews.  Arrived early for our table and we're accommodated with a table by a patient and friendly hostess.  The restaurant's seating configuration makes it seem much bigger than it is, and kitchen is off a back corridor so the dining area felt very cozy.  Lovely modern decor, soft lighting.  Our server was wonderful...very pleasant and attentive.  Didn't rush us.  Food was delish!  The meatball appetizer was tender and flavorful.  The beet salad was also tasty and refreshing.  Our entrees wereserved piping hot-seafood linguine and skirt steak.  Dessert was divine-bread pudding-best we've had.  Absolutely coming back over the holidays with the family!\", 'This new spot on Steiner has only been open for a month and I was very impressed by the service, ambiance, and the food. The appetizers were better than the mains (imo) but everything was great. The standout was the steak tartare for me. They also play great music and the staff are friendly. Would definitely come back for dinner and drinks.', \"Was startled to see that a beautiful new restaurant had opened in the old Saiwalks (and Askew way back when) spot on Steiner, so decided to check it out.  Had no idea we'd be one of the first customers during their soft opening!This place is going to stick. Great design, crowd pleasing menu and fantastic food.The interior is modern, trendy and gorgeous.  Hard to believe that it has been a fast casual restaurant for the past few decades.  LOVED the dishes/glasses/flatwear.  Nice parklet.  Everyone who worked there was incredibly gracious and excited to see us.Menu has some nice bistro breadth and offers something different than most other places in the Marina.  A few salads, a few pastas, a few meat dishes...something for everyone!  Since it's brand new, here's the rundown:Bread with truffle butter:  A++.  We had a long argument about getting a second serving or not and finally caved.  Really delicious!Butternut Squash Soup:  Outstanding.  I don't usually like butternut squash, but loved this soup.Tomatoes and Burrata:  Tasty and beautifully presented, could have been just a little larger.Goat Cheese Pasta (forget the name):  Beautiful stuffed pastas (sort of tortellini like) with a little honey mustard on the inside that set it apart from anything you've had before.  The chef and server both told us this is their pick for the top dish.Skirt steak with truffle mashed potatoes:  Yum!  Fantastic pan sauce that I wanted to mop up with the extra bread (though found the will power to restrain myself).Spaghetti and meatballs:  Really delicious meatballs and a hearty portion.Tiramisu:  Very good, you won't be sad.Only constructive feedback is that the wine list could use a bit of elevation.  It's pedestrian (lots of names you'll find at Safeway) with a hearty, though not outrageous markup.  No cocktails; didn't read the beer offerings.  They'll get this figured out and this place is going to rock.  $150 for three of us...not crazy.Check it out soon.  It's definitely going to be a neighborhood winner!\", 'This place is next level with the quality and service and ambiance. The food is very tasty, made with so much love not your typical Italian cuisine. Berry was very a lovely hostess she took care of us and recommended the best dishes. She stuck by and made sure we had a great time. Must try!', 'I was in SF for work and because it was also my birthday, my wife decided to join me. After a disappointing Italian meal in Vegas, I was determined to find something good in SF. While there were initially just a few reviews for Bagatella, the place lived up to the hype. The area is still a reminder of what San Francisco is all about and this place is a perfect fit. As soon as you walk in, you can tell there is something special happening. Beautifully decorated from the flowers over the outdoor seating to the super comfortable chairs at the table. Dave and his staff were super courteous, attentive and made my birthday a celebration to be remembered! The food was amazing with the soft bread and truffle butter being a highlight of the meal. We saw this pasta selection with a honey mustard based sauce but did not order as my wife is not a fan of honey mustard. It was certainly a chef specialty as they brought us out a sample and it was divine! Of course the seafood pasta and my filet were amazing as well. To top it all off, they presented me with a birthday dessert that turned out to be one my favorites...key lime. Combined with the wonderful singing, I was truly touched. If you are in the area, give Bagatella a shot as it was not overpriced and worth every penny.', 'No Fees', 'Went to this new gem in the Marina this past weekend, and was blown away by the entire course. It was a calm ambiance to begin with and became very live halfway through our stay. To start, we had their fresh heirloom tomato and beet salad, then onto a rich and creamy gnocchi, steak tartare in a delicious truffle oil, and my favorite main dishes--pan seared juicy chicken breast and a scrumptious sacchetti pasta. Our server Berry was a lovely addition to the entire night. She was welcoming, super efficient and made this experience unforgettable.', \"Bagatella is such a wonderful addition to the neighborhood! While it was the awesome vibe that first grabbed our attention and lured us in for dinner, it's the amazing food and service that have us so excited to go back. The steak tartare was one of the best we've had (and it's a dish we order a lot). Our seafood pasta was delicious as was the beet salad. And I'm still thinking about the incredible warm bread with truffle butter. The restaurant decor and ambiance is stunning - you can tell how much intention went into each decision from the sleek modern seating, unique flatware, and beautifully decorated outdoor space. With such great food, friendly staff and a chic atmosphere, this place is a must try!\", 'Bagatella which took over the saiwalk space looks like a total transformation.  We were there in the thanksgiving afternoon for the first time and it was a very pleasant surprise.   We order beets salad, roasted prawn, ceasar salad... etc.  Everything was simple and expertly prepared. The decor was beautiful, modern and elegant.  I would bring some friends back and try other food.', \"My friends and I dropped by Bagatella recently and it was such a treat! The place had a great atmosphere - awesome music and stylish decor.Now, let's talk about the food! We started with the squash gnocchi (a big hit), Caesar salad, and beet salad. All of them were absolutely delicious.For the main course, the pan-seared chicken breast was the standout dish. It was bursting with flavor - a definite must-try.To end our meal, we had a cappuccino and tiramisu. Both were fantastic. Shoutout to Dave, our waiter, for his attentive service and spot-on recommendations.We had a fantastic time and can't wait to come back for more!\", \"They brought the 5 stars to SF back. The food makes you want to eat 5 times a day, can't forget about the flavor and its consistency. I had an amazing experience with their restaurant . The customer service was outstanding, and the food was exactly what I was looking for.I was so pleased with the service I received from this business. They went above and beyond to serve us. Thank you to who ever is behind the great team.\", 'Stunning dinner from start to finish. If you want to impress your date/ company, bring them here. This is a special place with a great, unique experience.Food delivery was prompt and presentation was gorgeous.', \"My friends and I recently checked out this restaurant and we had such a great experience. We ordered a bunch of appetizers, and the standout for me was the squash gnocchi. Absolutely delicious! For the main course, I would highly recommend the filet mignon and the pan-seared chicken breast. Both dishes are extremely flavorful. For dessert, I would recommend the tiramisu and the key lime pie. I loved both so can't really choose just one. We would like to thank Dave for his friendly service throughout the evening. Such a fun time, we will definitely be coming back soon.\", \"Opened just two weeks ago! This new restaurant in the Marina is beautiful, ambiance is on point! Service is amazing and food is impeccable! Must try when you're in the area!\", 'Excellent food and wonderful stuff. They really take the time to make sure you are happy with the food and service. We brought our nephew and he enjoyed his meal along with my husband and I. Our server was the best. She was amazing. Enjoying great food!!', 'Absolutely perfect!  Excellent service.  Beyond excellent.  The food was perfect.  The decorum was lovely.  After a long day it felt great to be so pampered.', 'No Fees', 'Food was great quality and plating was aesthetic. The decor and ambiance makes for a super modern and sleek and cool vibe. The service was so sweet that they even treated us to their lemon tart dessert which was 10/10. Shoutout to Elena for the amazing service and care for our evening dining. Will recommend and for sure be coming back again!', \"I had the pleasure of checking out Bagatella in SF. It's located in the Marina around Lombard street so the location is super popular and cute! The interior decor was lovely, super modern. I loved the accents of greenery and gold throughout the restaurant. Really well done on the design. Now the foooood! I tried out many of the items on the menu, and it was all SO tasty. The butternut squash gnocchi was one of my favorites! The sauce consisted of Gorgonzola cheese which is my FAV type of cheese, and I always give props to restaurants that take the risk in using such a pungent cheese. It's dangerous! But Bagetella incorporated it beautifully. The burrata did not disappoint. The beet salad was so fresh and packed full of flavors. I loved the Caesar salad as well. Simple, yet really delicious because the romaine lettuce was super crispy which I love. Acing a simple dish is harder than it sounds, and they definitely pulled through! Now for the main meal. I had the Sacchetti Pasta. This was phenomenal! The honey mustard with the mascarpone sauce was the perfect combination. Inside each tortellini is a mixture of pear and cheese (if I remember correctly) so the blend of sweet and savory was perfect. Finally, had a lovely and creamy latte. Perfect size too. Not too small, not too big. Big shoutout to Dave our waiter! His service was phenomenal. He was always attentive, always filled our waters, and asked us how everything was as we finished each course. If you're ever in the mood for a lovely dinner with friends, colleagues, or a partner, I highly recommend Bagatella. Can't wait to come back!\", \"Omg. I can't believe they are open today. It was great. If you are looking for a place for good food,  drinks and classy dining experience, you should check out the restaurant. Another great place for Marina district.\", \"Tried this new neighborhood spot tonight and it didn't disappoint! Broad menu that was good across the board - from skirt steak, to salmon, to pasta. The truffle butter and warm bread to start was a nice touch too. With perfectly attentive service throughout and a nice ambiance. Pro tip, ask to try the bread pudding for dessert!\", 'This ambience is phenomenal. Menu is on point. Great wine list including by the glass. I ordered the filet mignon which was great but my wife ordered the chicken and wow that was mind blowing. Do not miss the chicken. Ask for Berry as your server. Phenomenal job and very attentive. Thank you!', 'I had an incredible dining experience at this restaurant! The food was absolutely amazing - we ordered the skirt steak, wine, chicken, and sacchetti pasta, and every dish was a delight. Dave, the owner, made the evening even more special with his personal touch. The service was top-tier, and to top it off, since it was my birthday, he surprised us with complimentary key lime pie and tiramisu. A 5-star celebration!', 'Wonderful ambience. Excellent food. Tremendous service. There was an issue with a flickering light on the wall and the owner killed the light ASAP. I will come back often.', 'Modern style dinging with great craftsmanship in the kitchen. The linguini and red beet salad were super delicious. Do not miss the gnocchi in gorgonzola crème source before you indulge the main course. Go for the orange crème brulee to finish a nice evening. Great service and attention to detail. Loved the modern dish sets.', \"So excited for this new addition to the neighborhood. The atmosphere is lovely and the food is delicious. I loved the Beet and Goat Cheese salad! I'll definitely be back.\", 'No Fees']\n",

Although the restaurant is smaller, they do have a long table that can accommodate larger group. I definitely recommending ordering a variety of plates because they are shareable.

Let's start with the med height guy with a curled mustache I think who greeted us, he was meh not too attentive but okay, sat us down in the corner booth table because I asked for that, sure wished he told me of another booth table in the back with more space as we are very tall people, nonetheless we were snug & comfy which was all that mattered! Then a young blond guy with a half ponytail bartender I believe came and took our drink order! My son mentions happily to him ... it's my parents 31st anniversary... and this guy just had this blank stare as if he were saying in his head ... AND? ... gave him our drink order and another guy took our appetizer order maybe the guy who sat us down? Can't remember! Throughout the night a very tall handsome server who we saw treat every guest with a huge smile and laughter and silently I wished he was our Server! Entree time we sort of got my wish cause he came and asked if we were ready to order and the one that sat us down pushed through and said not so nicely ... I GOT IT ... and we watched the Happy one walk away still smiling! He later came and asked if I wanted anything else and I asked for more wine and could not help but squeeze in there how I loved how he treated his guests and his smile! Didn't get his name but I do remember his face and will definitely ask to sit in his area!  That was that! We loved the ambiance and if all the servers were like the tall guy, well you'll be seeing us more!Now the food ... absolutely delicious! The calamari was the only meh dish we had, kinda rubbery but had a delicious taste. Sorry won't be ordering that again! I love me some crunch and some tentacles in my calamari ha ha!Those other two servers would smile and be like the tall server this night would've been even more amazing! From the ambience to the food to the wine everything was just wonderful even with those two hiccups! So Blind Butcher we will be back but we will ask to sit in the happy tall guys area!\", \"I wanted to give this place 3.5 stars. The ambiance is great, it was pretty packed on a Thursday night and in a great location in Castro. The service was a little slow (probably bc they were busy) and forgot our drinks until after the food came. The food was ok, I was excited for the Wagyu burger ($27) but it was a lot smaller than I expected, and the meat was SO dry I couldn't even finish it. I wish they put other toppings inside it like lettuce, pickles, or anything to give some juiciness. The fries that came with it were delicious though! My partner got a chicken dish that was tastier and more worth the price. The mashed potatoes it came with were really great! If I come back here, I would definitely try the Mac and cheese after all the positive reviews about it!\", \"While we were eating at Blind Butcher, a guy casually walks by nekkid...full frontal and everything...and hardly anyone bats an eye.Except the tourist couple whose jaws were sweeping the floor.That's what I love about The Castro...if you got the balls to, anything goes!Been eyeing The Blind Butcher since they opened in 2019 (sister resto to Dunya and Lark). And, my curiosity further grew with their hype on socials. When Plan A fell through, Blind Butcher it is because last minute rezzies were very easy to get. But, rezzies weren't needed since it was pretty empty on a Thursday. So, if you're looking for last minute place for a weeknight dinner, Blind Butcher may be a good option.Blind Butcher is open for takeout and dine-in. No delivery.

The accompanying chimichurri was hella salty so I appreciated that it was on the side. The ribeye includes several pieces of roasted potatoes, shishito peppers, and a tomato. Had we known this, we wouldn't have ordered another side of mashed potatoes.S E R V I C E Our server was nice and upbeat. Maybe it was an off day but service was too lax and lacked attention to detail.

There's four patio tables in front.P A R K I N GChallenging street parking so give yourself an extra 15-20 minutes. No nearby garages.Overall, I have mixed feelings about Blind Butcher. While they nailed the meat temps, I didn't think the food and service was commensurate to a $100 pp dining experience. IMHO, there's plenty of other places in the city you can better spend that monies. Glad I tried it once tho.\", \"This place is so so yummy! My boyfriend found it on tik tok and we gave it a shot during one of our weekend stays in SF. We had the ribeye board and it came with shishito peppers, tomato, potatoes and a side of chimichurri. The ribeye was SO good and the bucatini we had was delicious too. Definitely a higher price point restaurant but everything was delicious even our cocktails. I wouldn't think twice about coming again!\", \"Absolutely amazing food, service and ambience! It's in a busy area in the Castro so plenty of do after dinner!We loved that they were able to accommodate our big group and sat us pretty quickly. Our waiter, Curtis, was amazing and extremely attentive the entire evening. Even reading the note on open table that it was our friends birthday and brought him out birthday desserts. The food tastes just as good as it looks! Id recommend sharing the ribeye and ordering some sides. It's good enough to feed 3. It's a big boy! Our friends ordered the rosemary chicken and not pictured is the Wagyu burger which my friend said he could lick and eat the whole plate! Will be coming back soon!\", 'Came in on a wednesday night to celebrate a birthday. We had reservations so we were seated right away. There are a good amount of tables along the wall in a pretty intimate space. We noticed it was quite busy even for a wednesday. We ordered calamari, potatoes, prime rib eye, and pork chop. We loved it all. The rib eye was cooked perfectly medium and came with little potatoes and peppers on the side. The pork chop was moist and had lots of carrots and potatoes in the sauce. The calamari was thick and tasted really well with the sauce. The potatoes were a great side and perfectly cooked. We did family style and between the 3 of us, there were still some leftovers. We ordered the opera cake and tiramisu for dessert. The cakes were moist and rich and a perfect way to end our dinner. Overall i was really impressed with the food and cant wait to come back again.', 'DON\\'T LET THE NAME FOOL YOU - Great place even for vegetarians / pescatarians!!! Their Hip wood-based decor with ambient lighting makes for a cozy date night spot.Started off with some fresh fries lightly tossed in spices. Crisp outside, mushy inside (perfect)! They served some chardonnay to go with the appetizer. The main course was a family style butcher board (which my friends verified was delicious) and the lobster mac & cheese. Generous portions of lobster in the dish, with a perfect crisp cheese layer up top and gooey bits inside. The mac and cheese was served in a cast iron pan which kept it warm throughout our meal. Macaroni was al dente, and the bite on the pasta mixed so well with the mushy cheese! Service was excellent and they accommodated my vegetarian dietary preferences by serving me a Moussaka from their neighbor restaurant \"Lark\". It was mildly spiced and had lots of fresh veggies. Finally, the merlot that was served with the main course was rich with some fruity notes. Great for sipping though a conversation. Must visit the Blind Butcher!', 'I was really impressed with the branzino and the Elderberry cocktail, but less so with the practically raw shishito peppers. The service was scatterbrained and we were often left waiting long periods of time to place orders. Our two hour meal could have expediently been half that with more attentive service. The dining area was nevertheless nicely decorated and dark enough and loud enough to impart some privacy, though not so much of either to be miserable. Overall, standard overpriced meal in San Francisco.', \"Before I dive into my review, I want to mention that for me personally, food alone is 3/5, but I gave an extra star because of the ambiance.Let's talk about the food first. My friend and I ordered these dishes -1. Butcher's wagyu sliders (small bites)2. Crispy calamari3. Rack of lamb4. TiramisuWagyu sliders were definitely bigger than what I had in mind. The meat was very juicy, and the buns were soft. That, combined with the aioli sauce, made the sliders delicious. Crispy calamari wasn't much crispy and was okay. The rack of lamb was also okay. The meat was very tender and well cooked but lacked flavors. It came with horseradish sauce, but it was too strong. Tiramisu was delicious. It was very light and just the right amount of sweetness.This place is a great date night spot because of the ambiance. It's very modern, cozy, warm, and welcoming. The walls are covered with photos and paintings of old artists and San Francisco city from back in the days. There was jazz music playing in the background, and I liked it, though I wish it wasn't as loud. Our server was really nice and was on top of taking care of us.\", \"Years ago, I raved about this place and awaited the day I would come back. Unfortunately, the dishes weren't as incredible as I remembered. Besides the brussel sprouts, which were seriously the best appetizer I've had recently! Each piece was a crispy, sweet and salty morsel that would change anyone's mind about this vegetable. The Grilled Prosciutto Burrata appetizer was a favorite as well. Other than that, the wagyu burger which my group and I all ordered was pretty average. I guess in my head I hyped it up so as I ate it, it felt quite dry and underwhelming. I ordered mine cooked medium too so not sure how it didn't hold its moisture. The ciabatta was dry and complicated the burger experience too. Another dish that fell short was the truffle lobster mac and cheese. As much as I wanted to believe there was lobster in this, I feel like it was crawfish... the flavor, the size, all just insinuated crawfish in the soupy cheese sauce. It had somewhat of a fishy/seafood flavor to the dish and no noticeable truffle taste. Although the entrees underperformed, the service absolutely did not. We didn't have a reservation and they were booked for dinner, but the host made it work with some open outdoor space. He constantly made sure we were comfortable and got our food out quickly. The chef also stopped by our table throughout the meal. He was bouncing between their neighboring sister restaurants and thanked us for visiting them. I would come back for the apps, drinks, and hospitality!\", 'Cozy/moody ambiance, wonderful service, and delicious, flavorful food. We especially loved the roast chicken with veggies and potatoes, short ribs and potatoes, and the overall variety of dishes they offer. There is something for everyone, and the dishes are shareable. Drinks and dishes are on the pricier end however the quality is good. Hope to visit again soon.', \"The moment I had got there it was a great ambiance. It was a busy night and I thought I had out my reservation in but it was on the wrong day! They were very able to accommodate me anyway! Plus one star! Staff and service was very nice. Overall: 1 star added for the service alone which was very friendly, but as a food critic and something of a culinary artist myself I cannot bring myself to give this place more than one star for the food.The nitty gritty:I ordered the prime ribeye medium rare and came out super rare. The cook must have not let it sit the appropriate amount of time before cutting and serving.The octopus was undercooked as well, leaving a gummy undercooked seafood texture we all know as sashimi shrimp.However the sauce and herbs surrounding the dish was superb and I ate each bite with it.The back of the octopus was cooked perfectly so they must not have used something to hold it down as it grilled.We ordered the calamari which was greasy and the breading was soggy :(.The waygu burger was alright but still undercooked to how we had requested.Truffle fries were really good.I was really amped to go here and try it out due to the hype on social media and I feel they may be overwhelmed by all the new attention it has been receiving.The taste was all there but the preparation needs work. For the price it cost to eat here I may not be coming back.It was a nice effort though. They were pretty crowded.Edit: I actually decided to downgrade my star review because the dishes were unique and good quality. But I shouldn't be paying over 180$ for a meal that is brought out raw. I know what kind of neighborhood it is but not everyone likes it raw. Also if there is something wrong with every single dish we ordered, quality control must be instilled. Idk if he was on vacation or what but this was completely unacceptable.\", 'Welcomed and enjoyed our evening assisted by Manny. We ordered the Brussels sprouts- very tasty! Also the burrata ravioli and the short rib- plentiful portions and good flavor. Frankly the ravioli tasted more like ricotta than burrata but the freshness of the homemade pasta and the delicious sauce were fantastic. Short rib was fall off the bone and the amount of the meat was commensurate with the price. Lovely meal. We chose toeat  outdoors which was great but inside looked so cozy and hip!', \"Everything was cooked to perfection and seasoned well. I thoroughly enjoyed the steak, and absolutely loved the octopus appetizer. The service was really quick, we didn't wait long for any of our dishes, including water refills & check. Would highly recommend!\", \"Came to Blind Butcher to Celebrate my daughter's birthday and the host and everyone around was so nice and welcoming. Love the atmosphere and the food was 10/10 We all enjoyed our dinner party and will definitely be back.\", 'Celebrating an early bday for bff-fam at Blind Butcher. Ever since they posted their iconic celebratory reel on the gram, we needed to check out all the fanfare it generated. Vibes are completely chill w/ eclectic art, plush red booth seats, and dim lighting...giving jazz club vibes for cool cats. Menu is simple there are apps, protein options and whole braised branzino to feed a small family of 9...so we got two of those because why not. lol Please do not sleep on the apps: Crispy Calamari, Grilled Octopus, Shishito, Truffle French Fries... and the table ordered to share Braised Short Ribs, Lamb Chops, Ribeye Steak, & Prawns. The kid ordered their lobster truffle mac. Dylan helping our table was amazing...beautiful, attentive, and super accommodating and friendly. Made the dinner so comfortable and our groupreally enjoyed. Go here and order everything. Street parking and a lot off Castro St. entrance, we got lucky and found one right in front. Planning to revisit in the near future! Thank you/Mahalo Blind Butcher!', \"Came here for an early Father's Day celebration.  We ordered a few dishes and decided to do it family style.  Everything was delicious and came out relatively quick.  Definitely worth a revisit. My only critique is that there were 5 of us and two small round tables were put together to accommodate us.  Sitting wise we had plenty of space but once the food came it was a game of shuffle to make space.\", 'I\\'ve been wanting to try this restaurant for months. I finally got the opportunity when I had a friend visiting me for the weekend. I wanted to love this restraint so much but unfortunately our dining experience was just okay. First, our waiter changed twice so we\\'re confused on who was going to be taking care of us. We ordered some sparkling rose and champagne but when the server delivered the drinks they were confused as to which drink was which.  They even had to go back and check to make sure. To their defense the restaurant is very dim. The food was fine but nothing exceptional. We started with the burrata (w/ prosciutto) and Brussel sprouts. We shared the ravioli, spaghetti and meatballs, fillet mignon, and salad. All dishes were ok. The fillet was very rare and when we checked with the server they said that is considered \"medium\" to them. We didn\\'t want to be those people, so we just ate what we wanted and left a good portion of the steak on the plate.Probably won\\'t be returning anytime soon.', \"Sweet, kind staff, SUPERtender meat, and a cool-a$$ interior for chilling and drinking bottles of wine-- the blind butcher is easily my favorite restaurant in the Castro area. Stop by if you're in the mood for some steak, lobster Mac and Cheese, or just a cup of white wine on a hot summer day (sunshine emoji)\", \"I came here a few evenings ago for my Birthday hoping to enjoy an array of great food and drinks and was sadly disappointed. I booked through OpenTable and none of the staff mentioned it was my Birthday.I arrived for my reservation and was sat by a waiter who was largely uninterested in my presence. On the way to show me my table, another waiter blocked my path serving the table beside me. I was forced to stand between the host and the waiter for about a minute which was awkward. From then, it took about 9 minutes for the waiter to come and ask me about drinks and about another 12 for one cocktail to be made.  I started with the Octopus and the Lamb Lollipops. These took a long time to come out (25+ minutes) and the Lamb was burnt on the outside as was a reasonably sized amount of the octopus. Both were tasty once you got past the char. The salad on the Lamb was particularly good.For mains we got the sliders, the prime ribeye, potatoes and ravioli. These took an incredible amount of time to come out. The potatoes  came out 5 minutes before everything else. I did order another cocktail and had to ask the waiter a second time for the drink because I already had waited 15+ mins. The Ribeye actually came with potatoes which wasn't mentioned when I ordered.In terms of the food:Ribeye - Great. Must order!Potatoes - Meh. Mine were undercooked and honestly not that tasty.Ravioli - Solid, but not much actual pasta in the dishSliders - Very mehThis place held a Yelp Elite event a month ago. They should know better. All in all, very disappointed.\", \"Great hole in the wall it seems , beautiful ambiance & very friendly service. The food was absolutely delicious : lamb chops sooo juicy & tender I'd definitely go back !\", \"Came here to celebrate my friend's birthday, and we had such a great time. The servers are very fast, and nice. It's such a cute ambiance inside since it's dim (cute place for date nights). The music inside isn't too loud, so good place to go to for catching with friends, etc. UGH. The food's pretty good. The steak was cooked so GREAT, and it was very flavorful & juice. The mashed potatoes on the side that I ordered was also So yummy!!! Menu is so simple, but has a little bit of everything you'd want. Totally would go back again.\", \"I came in to celebrate my birthday with a group of friends and had a seamless experience calling and getting a reservation, and getting questions answered - they allow cake cutting as well as bringing your own wine bottles (their corkage fee is $25). The service was quick and friendly, and the ambiance is nice for a special occasion. They also allow for you to order vegan/vegetarian dishes from their sister restaurant Lark if your party requires accommodation. The 2 dishes I ordered were a little underwhelming. The truffle lobster Mac & cheese didn't seem like it had much truffle or lobster - the lobster pieces were small and chewy, but it was a good quantity. The lamb lollipops were tasty, but the price was a little steep at $22 for lollipops. They also brought out a piece of cake with a candle for my birthday :)I would give the food alone at this restaurant 3/5, but overall the ambiance and service brings it up to a 4 for me.\", \"The ambiance here is so lovely! The service is even better than the ambiance! We ordered the arugula salad, the grilled octopus and the lamb lollipops.The salads were quite generous. We probably could have shared one. I'm usually not a fan of sweet salads but this one was tasty indeed. The arugula was very fresh and the fruit was tasty. The octopus was prepared perfectly and hubby loved the nice tomato sauce. The lamb was fabulous. It was a bit crisp on the outside and perfectly tender and juicy on the inside. It benefited from salt which I easily added. I do feel the prices here are a bit high but overall we did enjoy our meal very much!\", \"We had been dying to eat here! And it was like we died and went to heaven  Melodramatic I know but it was THAT good! From the service to food to music to that fun ambiance... Curtis was amazing and fun on top of being attentive to our needs. We had the rib-eye, whole fish, wagyu sliders, truffle fries, burrata ... and the OMG Lobster Truffle Mac and Cheese. I can't have dairy and I was willing to hurt myself for it  Everything on the menu is definitely worth trying based on the experience we had with the dishes we ordered.Still dreaming about the Mac and Cheese. Go with a crew so you could order a lot and not feel like you had to gorge yourself. Cheers to eating well!\", '[TLDR: Generous portions, delicious and diverse food choices, extensive wine and beer list, no cocktail menu (coming soon), friendly and speedy staff.]Dining at Blind Butcher with a group made my first visit here so much more enjoyable because I got to try more than just one dish!  After being ushered to our table in the back, we started to order drinks when we were told there wasn\\'t a cocktail menu (our waitress said it should be finalized in Jan/Feb 2023) but offered to make us almost any mixed drink.  In their defense, the venue had only re-opened a few months prior, so it wasn\\'t a big deal to craft one myself.  I started off with a dirty gin martini and quickly switched to a glass of Malbec once my entree arrived. When you talk about meat falling off the bone, their braised short ribs are the prime example.  So tender, flavorful, and scrumptious!  I was a bit confused by the sauce, which the menu labeled as a \"wine jus reduction\", but the meat seemed to be doused in a tomato pasta sauce.  By no means is this a complaint, because the meat, sauce, and potatoes were incredibly delicious.  The rest of our table opted for the burger, grilled pork chops, Roka salad, and we all split the calamari to start.Our waitress brought over a bowl of salted caramel gelato for the birthday boy, complete with a candle on top!  Prices were a bit steeper than I expected, but honestly worth it for the very generous portions you receive.  Looking forward to coming back and seeing what cocktails the mixologists have been working on!', \"Wanted to review just because service was extraordinary! Not only did our server make connection with table but just the overall experience from start to end. After appetizers are finished they make sure to clear your plate and utensils and provide you with new ones for your main course. They make sure nothing unnecessary is on your table at all times and come around regularly to make sure everything is okay. Not only are we serviced the whole time but they also make sure to pack up your to go order for you when your done with your meal. It's the little things!\", \"Amazing food and ambiance. Service was on point and I can't wait to go back! Check it out.\", \"Made reservations for my partner's birthday on a Friday night. I definitely recommend making reservation as it gets pretty packed after 6pm. We got the wagyu sliders and the Roka salad to start. It was my first time having wagyu and i definitely understand the hype now, SO good. They add caramelized onions as well, and it just elevated the burger just enough to reach peak flavor. I highly recommend the Roka salad- the bits of apple and dried fig in combination with the arugula and goat cheese was perfectly sweet and savory. It ticked all the boxes for me. The prime ribeye was presented beautifully and the roasted onion, Shishito peppers, and tomato were a welcomed addition to our slab of meat. Thank god for the mound of flakey salt they provide, because the meat definitely needed an extra oomph. It was good, but now that i've tried it, I probably wouldn't order again. The mashed potatoes were decadent, perfectly creamy, but had to add a bit of that flakey salt to really bring it to flavortown. They brought over a nice slice of cake for my partner's birthday and it was perfect. Grateful for the healthy pours of wine and a full belly!\", \"Food is good especially the octopus dish,Service is good but a little off maybe I didn't get a good vibe from our server. Ambiance is fine nothing fancy but comfortable\", 'Took my BF here for bday dinner last night- food was excellent- service great! Such a cute spot - We had the calamari to start  and then the Branzino and 16 Oz ribeye - both cooked and seasoned perfectly in my opinion!I was bummed that we both did not have room for dessert! I would definitely come back :-)', 'Really nice service staff. Brunch was good (we had grilled chicken sandwiches) but we were surprised by the cost. $$$Beautiful lighting and decor. Wonderful wine selection.', 'Blind Butcher is a hidden gem in the city (CASTRO). Honestly, I love when restaurants are able to satisfy ALL MY SENSES -- visually, aesthetically, taste, and all that jazz. This is definitely one of those places.Everything we ordered was on point with the portion size, taste, and freshness. APPETIZERS:- Truffle Fries: Crispy, delicous, and truffley - Brussel Sprouts: Cooked to perfection and the char was crispy - Octapodaki: SUPER TENDER and cooked perfectly -- soft and one of the best octopus I have ever had- Crispy Calamari: Large, thick, calamari rings -- yummy seasoning and enjoyed the sauce it came with- Lamb Lollipops: Typically, not a lamb person as I did not grow up with eating lamb, but I enjoy lamb -- SOFT, TENDER, FLAVORFUL, AND COOKED PERFECTLYYYYY - Roka SaladENTREES:- Rack of Lamb: One of the best rack of lambs I have ever had. - Prime Rib: COOKED TO PERFECTION and the prime rib had a nice marbling and the fat was soo good!- Whole Grilled Branzino: My friend said it needed more seasoning, but I enjoyed the light clean fresh plain flavor. REALLY FRESH - Truffle Lobster Mac and Cheese: THEY DID NOT SKIMP OUT ON THE LOBSTER -- I could honestly eat a whole tray!- Wagyu Burger: The cibatta bread was perfect with the wagyu burger and one really delicious -- the best wagyu burger I have ever had- Prawns Girades: Large PRAWNS, cooked perfectly, tastyDESSERTS: - Opera Cake- Salted Caramel Gelato: SO DELICIOUS AND CREAMY -- paired well with the pistachio - Coppa 3 Cioccolati: Tasted like a large Ferror Rocher (REALLY GOOD AND TASTED LIKE HAZELNUT)- TiramisuWe were the first ones there and the cooks cooked our food so quickly -- seriously was in amazement with how fast they did it. The service was amazing and the cocktails, food, and desserts were all soooooo mouth watering delicious , tasty, and soooo good. My mouth is seriously watering just writing this review. I highly recommend this place for a birthday, intimate date night, celebration, or even a solo dolo dinner while sitting at the bar. This place is seriously a hidden gem in the city and you must pass by here if you have the chance. I promise you will not be disappointed!!!!', \"As a gay man, I have to say I felt STRANGE to eat in an ALL straight client venue in The Castro. I say this because we have to deal with the str8 world all week and to be in The Castro, I expect some diversity.Food: Good, kinda pricey but the flavor justifies the price. I guess the going rate of a burger is $27 bucks??Service: At first no seats on a Friday night. We can sit outside which is fine but there's a big outdoor umbrella in the middle of a tiny table for two. As I was tried to get the waiters attention to see if we can move as he's talking to another couple, his hand raised to me, I'll be with you in a minute hand gesture. Eventually we got to sit inside. Ambience: Dark, sometimes too dark even to see your food. Rate: Would I go back? Maybe.\", \"When we drove by, I couldn't believe how packed the sidewalk was, in front of the restaurant. That definitely got me excited! Get early to your reservation, because you will be driving in circles, looking for parking. We parked four blocks away. Anyways, we eventually made it to the restaurant and waited for 10 minutes, because there was no hostess at the hostess stand. I could tell immediately, that they were understaffed, considering how busy they were. It's got a pretty cool ambience, they are playing some great electronic music and you'll love the way the place is decorated. Keep in mind, the restaurant is on the ground floor, where the garage would be, in a Victorian house. Eventually the hostess showed up and I think he was also a waiter. He told us it would be 15 minutes and it was more like a 1/2 hour. We were seated at the back of a restaurant restaurant, and our waitress showed up 10 minutes later. She was super sweet and as attentive as she could possibly be, considering they are understaffed. We ordered the Octopodaki, Lobster mac & cheese, Brussels Sprouts, Shishito Peppers, french fries, Truffle fries, Rack Lamb , Garides Bruchettes, Burrata Ravioli, Ribeye, along with a Bacardi and Coke,  an old fashioned, a lemon drop, a Shirley Temple, and two lemonades. Yes, we were there to throw down! The star of the meal was definitely the Burrata Ravioli. Everybody tried some and were blown away by the flavors. In no way am I saying the rest of the food was bad, but it was good average. I also amazed on how fast the food came out, which was great, because we were starving. I feel for the staff, because you can tell they are great people, are doing the best job they possibly can, but they are totally understaffed. Only negative about the meal, Garides Bruchettes. They were slightly over cooked and chewy. This is a popular restaurant and is noisy, keep that in mind. Also, understand that you are in the Castro and you will see things, that you will know not normally see. And it's OK. At the end of the night, we had a great time, enjoyed good food, friendly service and left satisfied. That's what it's all about. I will be back to have those Raviolis to myself.\", \"Dark, sultry,delightful We were welcomed with open arms and lovely banter as we waited for our table. A party of 3 to have dinner before seeing Morrissey perform at the Castro Theatre. I would highly recommend this spot as it's literally around the corner if your seeing a show at the theatre. The menu is small but packs a punch with it's amazing offerings. Two of us did the wagyu burger and the third the filet. The meat was deliciously presented, crafty use of mini butcher blocks as plates. The executed my request of medium rare to slightly more rare, utter heaven- melted in my mouth. We were looking for cocktails but only found a massive and very lovely selection of wines, however our waiter told us they had a full bar and could make anything we requested. They served us up two greyhounds and an amaretto sour - perfection! I will definitely be back to indulge again! Thank you, Blind Butcher for an impeccable dining experience\", \"The food here is still pretty good, but the size and quality has gone down and prices have gone up. We went in recently and noticed their $50 ribeye had jumped up to $70. Quite an increase and was upset to see that. I understand the need to increase price based on the cost of ingredients, but it seemed like a ridiculously high jump. Even more disappointing - the tiny portion of calamari, and the flavorless chimichurri. I don't know what happened. The first time I came here I was BLOWN AWAY by the ribeye with chimichurri. It was fresh and zesty and so delicious on the steak. What I got last time tasted old somehow...like it came out of a jar. It definitely did not offer the same fresh, flavorful punch that I'd experienced before. It wasn't even green anymore...it had taken on a darker almost brown color. Super unappetizing. I'm sad to say that I'll probably start looking for another go to place to celebrate in the city.\", \"Food: 5/5Service: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5 Overall the place serves amazing food! High price but definitely worth the cost for the amazing meal we had. Service could've been better but I think it's cause some of the staff is new, and so I think they'll improve over time. The music was loud at times but still very nice environment.Food: - Prime ribeye: chefs kiss so good! So flavorful didn't even need the chimichurri sauce- truffle fries: perfectly light hint of truffle not over powering- Kale salad: best kale salad I've ever had!- Rotisserie chicken: filling and very flavorful - Dessert: coppa 3 cioccolatto amazingly light and chocolateyService: we got seated in a less than optimal spot and the server had no idea where to place us. Unfortunately, it was by the sliding door and it kept getting open and hitting our table. Other than that, they were very attentive and got us our food very quickly.\"]\n",

      "Reviews: ['good food buenisima comida ya he ido varias veces se los recomiendo demasiado vayan y visitelos', \"Little Shucker is the shuckin' best! My husband and I came here for date night and we loved our experience.  The highlight for me was the oysters, raw and baked!  You could tell that the oysters were super fresh.  We had kumamotos, miyagis, and mere point oysters for our raw oysters, I believe. For the baked oysters, we tried the garlic butter (YUM), and the miso bone marrow (my personal fave!).  The spritz cocktails are really good too.  We tried the pink spritz and the lavender yuzu spritz (super refreshing).  I also liked that they had a natural wine on the menu. :)Little Shucker is perfect for date night or girls' night out!  The vibes and interior are super cute too.  Can't wait to come back.\", \"I've been on an oyster kick these days and Little Shucker was such a fantastic place to dabble. It's not cheap and you can quickly rack up a bill here, but it is surely worth the price you pay. Everything is so fresh and tasty. My friend and I came for lunch with a reservation but it wasn't too crowded. We got six Oysters, the Halibut Crudo, Smoked Salmon Tartine, and the Roasted Nori Cauliflower. The oysters were incredibly refreshing, and we love that we got to sample all three. I also loved the small plates we ordered. The cauliflower was so umami and had a nice bite to it, while the tartine was so hearty and creamy. Service was decent. Nothing to write home about but the atmosphere does make it worth the visit, as it's bright but homey.\", \"All the rave reviews are true - this place is a keeper! Perfect location and immaculate vibes, we loved everything about little shucker. We walked in at opening on a Saturday without a reservation and were seated immediately. The waitstaff was completely attentive and took our drink orders right away. One of our guests ordered a wine on tap, and within minutes was informed that they had to switch out the keg. She had to wait about ten minutes for her glass, and when it was brought to her, we were told it was on the house for her patience. She was offered alternatives but really wanted that wine, so despite her choosing to wait they still comped the glass - completely unnecessary but entirely grateful, we were won over immediately. Then the oysters came. In a city brimming with seafood options, this was the freshest of the fresh. We inhaled our dozen (with a variety from Tomales Bag and the east coast) just in time for the mussels to hit the table. When I tell you we were lapping up the garlic marinade, we were fighting over the last spoonful. For a seafood focused restaurant, their fries were also memorable, and the house hot sauce is  chef's kiss. Incredible experience all the way around - can't wait to come back to little shucker!\", \"Fresh seafood, cute interiors, $2 oyster happy hour, and good wine...how could you not have a good time at Little Shucker. This buzzy Pac Heights seafood spot from the team behind The Snug excels when it comes to simple, good seafood. I sampled a majority of the menu, and my favorite item was the Big Shucker, a classic chilled seafood tower that allows the quality to shine. If you love oyster shooters, you have to try their two creative takes - a sake tomato dashi with uni and a play on michelada with kimchi and pilsner. In addition to the tasty raw oyster selection, I also enjoyed the warm bone marrow baked oyster.For more substantial bites, I recommend the smoked salmon tartine with bright dill cream cheese on a fluffy pan de mie. The hot lobster roll was fine, but not as memorable. I would skip adding caviar to the roll, as it got lost with the strong flavors.My friend and I were comfortably full from the seafood feast, but we couldn't resist trying the pretty greek yogurt tart with seasonal stone fruit - a sweet, but restrained ending to a solid meal.I like that the smaller space, friendly staff, and menu lends itself to many occasions, whether it's a casual lunch, early happy hour, or romantic dinner date.\", 'Came here for dinner on a weekend.Food: 4Decor: 4Service: 46 oysters, 22miyagi, kumamoto, and mere point~4/5. Fresh and cleaned properly.hot lobster roll, 35~4/5. Fresh lobster in a nice, hot, toasted bun. Pretty good, although I think New England Lobster Co. in Burlingame is slightly better.Service was nice and friendly.', \"The cutest spot on Fillmore! Perfect for a sunny day in SF. We ordered the Rockefeller oysters, miso bone marrow oysters, garlic butter oysters and I would recommend them all. We added caviar to the oysters and it was We also got the lobster roll which came with a generous amount of seafood, and the branzino. I would say I've had better branzino elsewhere and would stick to appetizers and drinks here! Great place for friends\", \"Ambiance- decor was really nice and clean, bathrooms were well maintained and the table tops were tidyService- a little awkward and choppy but nice people, but incredibly slow for certain food items Food- some things were delicious and other things needed more attention*Big shucker- presentation was pretty, I think that the oysters were shucked fine, a little shelly but no real complaints. We sat at the bar so we watched them prepare the tower in front of us. The shrimp was really dry and didn't taste fresh at all, however the mussels were our favorite part! The Maine lobster was fine,nothing extraordinary and the geoduck was also okay. *lobster roll- I can't believe they charge 2$ for the chips when the roll is already 35$ I think that's absurd. It was also a small portion and lacked a sauce (butter isn't a sauce) **smoked trout salad- it reminded me of a deconstructed lox bagel in a good way. I wish the portion size was larger or if the plate had more lettuce ** we received our big shucker first at 2:15 and quickly finished the tower in about 10-15 mins because there wasn't a whole lot to it and we were super hungry. But we weren't served our salad and roll until 2:45 which we thought was a super long time to wait between plates. Especially because it wasn't particularly busy and the components of our plates were already made eg: the lobster was precooked and the trout was smoked so assembling the items on a plate shouldn't have taken too long (time stamps attached).  Price- not good, I hadn't realized or noticed that there was a 20% automatic service charge which I think is quite high (for this particular place). We were a group of four but they were kind and they split the bill into two for us because they noticed each couple shared items. I think 17-18% service charge is more realistic. Especially because we had really slow service between our plates.\", \"I have been craving baked oysters lately and it's actually quite hard to find.   Little Shucker appeared on my search and they had a reservation opened so we gave them a try. The ambience is so cute, it's so bright and welcoming, it reminds me being inside sometimes home in some coastal town.  They tend to get busy around 6pm, so I recommend making reservations. They have a happy hour menu too, and if you want that deal you have to come before 5 pm.  For Happy Hour they have raw oysters for 12 or 24 dollars depending if you get half a dozen or a dozen.  And of course, with happy hour there's wine or beer.  For our starters we did get the dozen oysters for $24.00 along with the crudo.  The fresh oysters were good and plump.  They gave you three sauces to pair with, the green sauce was the best. The crudo was paired with their avocado mousse and tomatoes which was so tasty!  I wish they gave us more of that mousse.   We also go the baked oysters which included the rockefeller, garlic butter, and miso bone marrow.  All of these were good, but i think my favorite was the Garlic Butter, followed by the Miso Bone Marrow and then the Rockefeller.   The miso bone marrow said it had cilantro but i couldn't taste it, which was good because i'm not a cilantro fan. The Lobster roll was delicious as you can taste how buttery the bread as and how sweet and juicy the lobster was.  It does get very messy to eat but it's worth the messiness. I hope they can expand their menu soon like their sister restaurant The Snug. I would love to come back and we can tell their staff is a great team as i see them working so well together.\", \"This is a great date night or outing spot in SF. I would 100% return for the baked oysters, especially the miso bone marrow. The service was incredibly attentive and we felt the dishes were fresh & delicious. The ambiance was nice, ample spacing around the tables, lighter color palette of the restaurant makes it feel larger, and it wasn't overly loud. 10/10\", 'Charming ambiance, delicious flavors, fresh seafood. Favorites were baked oyster miso bone marrow, lobster roll, and mussels.  Branzino was great as well.', 'Summary:Casual seafood cafe offering a small variety of tasty bitesDetails:Little Shucker reminds me a bit of the seafood spots you\\'d find up in the PNW, with their casual, but creative take on various seafood dishes, albeit with a more limited offering. That\\'s not to say you can\\'t get full here if you order enough of the right dishes, but it definitely has more of a \"come here and chill with some drinks and light bites\" vibe than a \"come stuff your face and belly\" one.Everything we had was pretty tasty, but the standouts included their garlic butter baked oysters (the miso bone marrow was just a tad too salty), halibut crudo, and hot lobster rolls (which is prepared differently than their cold), all of which came with very fresh ingredients, and some tasty, yet bright flavors. And honestly, the nori cauliflower was pretty tasty too, but it felt to us like it was mostly just a bunch of tasty banchan dumped on top of roasted cauliflower lol, so the value wasn\\'t quite there on that dish.Worth a stop by, but probably more as the precursor or successor to a nearby meal.Accessibility:Can\\'t speak for the interior, but plenty of accessible outdoor seating!', 'My friend brought me here for lunch for a belated birthday. This place is spectacular! All the staff was attentive, friendly, and accommodating, which made the experience so fantastic. I will be returning in the future. Shout out to everyone for such a good experience. The crudo, fried oysters, and the wine options were delightful.', \"My recent visit to little shucker in Pacific Heights had its ups and downs. While the lobster roll was meaty, it was on the pricier side and, unfortunately, it fell short of my expectations - it turned out to be rather average.On a more positive note, the Caesar salad was decent and made for a suitable companion to the lobster roll.If you're on the hunt for a great lobster roll, I'd recommend waiting for Broadstreet Oyster to open up in Ghirardelli Square or stop by New England Lobster Company when you are near SFO. The service at little shucker was good, but for a memorable lobster roll experience, it seems I might have to venture elsewhere next time.\", \"We dined here for lunch. Our group comprised of five adults and two babies. The service couldn't have been friendlier and attentive; especially with our babies joining in on the meal. We ordered oyster shooter lights, the chips and dip, the bread, oysters in the half shell, and the crudo. We happened to be there for happy hour, so that was a pleasant surprise. The shooters were inventive and fun. Everything was presented nicely and most importantly, it was fresh!\", 'Little shucker is has the cutest vibes! My partner and I love oysters so decided to give this spot a try. We got 6 oysters (2 of each type they had), the halibut crudo, mussels, and hot lobster roll. The oysters were super fresh! They give a lemongrass mignonette and two hot sauces with it. The olive oil on the crudo seemed really high quality and had such a good flavor, but honestly I thought it overpowered the halibut a little bit. The mussels were fire. The broth they were in was so delicious, and the portion was pretty big! Id say maybe around 20 mussels or so? I got fries with the mussels too, and they were super crisp and still fluffy in the middle. My partner got the lobster roll, which was good although I think the bread was a bit too buttery for me.', \"Oysters? YES! YES! YES! This new space (in the old Grove location) on Fillmore is just what the city has needed. A simple menu for indulging in fresh seafood, alongside a beautiful wine selection and bar. The restaurant is open and airy with fresh bright colors that just invoke a clean feel. Most oyster and seafood restaurants have a distinctly fishy smell, but not here, no no. We kept it simple with a couple dozen raw oysters, a couple of orders of baked oysters (who doesn't love Oysters Rockefeller?) and the Chips and Dip with the Caviar addition. I had a few Lavender Spritz that were refreshing and light. -Plenty of counter seats to watch the shuckers do their thing or table seating both indoor and outdoor-Unisex restroom -Reservations HIGHLY recommended to insure you get a seat -Service was quick and attentive JUST TREAT YOURSELF & get here if you love Oysters!\", \"Yayyyy new oyster spot in town :-) My friend booked a dinner reservation for the 4 of us-- AMAZING OYSTERS. To my understanding, they have a rotation, featuring some from Hog Island. Very cool & hip addition to an already quite upscale area.THE BIG SHUCKER: Perfect to split with a group of 4~ All extremely fresh & high quality. NEED to try their house-made green sauce-- it's fantastic.- SMOKED SALMON TARTINE: First time trying tartine on pan de mie, soooo pillowy soft and delicious. Small portions of salmon.- ROASTED NORI CAULIFLOWER: Hearty & umami-- even when shared, the small bowl is surprisingly filling- LOBSTER ROLL (hot): Ngl this is ok. $35 is high for a lobster roll... Tasty, but nothing insane.Only tried the seafood as we had 2 pescatarians in tow-- will need to come back to try the bone marrow another time.\", 'This place really did live up to the hype! So glad we came. What a lovely weekend brunch. I rarely give out 5 stars but this place was very deserving. My sisters and I had been dying to visit this place after it showed up all over instagram and had such great reviews. We came yesterday at noon. It was pretty quiet tbh - their dinner reservations are much harder to get!We ordered a ton of delicious food -- the big shucker, which was great, everything was fresh and amazing -- the salmon tartine, also amazing, and I got the lavender spritz and the lobster roll (warm with butter vs. cold) and added caviar. The spritz was almost too pretty to drink but man was it good! And the lobster roll was absolutely amazing. Maybe just a tad too much butter, but all in all so good. And they give you so much caviar as well! Not cheap but definitely really good and the service was phenomenal as well.', 'Came for happy hour on a Thursday around 4:30pm with a friend. Most tables and seats were full but the hostess found us a spot in their stand room area. Drinks: NA spritze - was good, sweet with a hint of bitterness wish this had a little more acidity to balance the sweetness but still enjoyable Food: Raw Oysters - fresh small to medium sized oysters with a slight salinity, served with lemon wedges, mignonette and hot sauce, there was a bit of shell and grit in some of the oysters Baked miso bone marrow oysters - really tasty, larger in size, creamy and rich with some fattiness from the bone marrow and savory umami from the miso Service was fine, pretty busy during happy hour but  servers came by regularly to check in. The hostess brought out water when we were first seated. Overall a decent spot for oyster happy hour. You can only order oysters and drinks in the bars standing area so if you want a full meal definitely grab a reservation.', \"Definitely recommend this cute little restaurant to satisfy your seafood cravings. Yesssss--it's not the cheapest, but with inflation and all, prices are on par with all the other seafood forward restaurants in the Bay Area.For appetizers, We ordered their baked oysters--which were to die for. We loved how savory the sauces were; it complimented the juicy oysters perfectly. We chose two out of the 3 flavors, rockerfeller and the miso one.  For our mains, my hubs ordered their signature lobster roll and I got the Caesar salad. Both dishes  were executed well. My salad was hardy and full of umami (extra points for having actual anchovies in it).  The guns loved his lobster roll which had well flavored lobster nestled inside a perfectly toasted soft bun. There are two versions--hot and cold, we opted for the hot. We finished off the meal with a side of Fries (yum) and some drinks. They have adorable and delicious tasting spritzers. Overall, great experience and ambiance. Pricey food--but cute drinks.\", \"Little Shucker is where The Grove used to be on Fillmore and they've really done a great job renovating the space.  My friend and I ordered the chips with dip to share.  The dip is sour cream, chives, and fried shallots.  It's simple, but delicious!  For myself, I got the baked garlic butter oysters, the roasted nori cauliflower, Cesar, salad, and a nonalcoholic wine spritzer.  That was the perfect lunch!  The baked oysters were cooked so perfectly!  The the oysters were so plump and juicy.  I really like the addition of the bread crumbs on top. I also got one oyster with caviar for an additional five dollars.  It was a good serving of caviar too.  And it wasn't over the top - I thought it enhanced the flavors of the big oyster really well.  But they're also good on their own so if you're not a caviar fan you're not missing out.  But I suggest you treat yourself because you deserve it and get that caviar.The roasted nori cauliflower was also really good. It had a good char and smokiness which balance well with the overall acidity of the dish.  The Caesar salad was pretty big and my friend and I probably could've shared it. I've never had anchovies with my Caesar salad. I know that they're usually in the dressing but the salad has literal anchovy meat in it. I thought it was good because it added a saltiness to the salad. I am so glad that they have a few nonalcoholic options because I currently cannot drink alcohol at the moment.  My white wine spritzer was delicious and not too sweet. This place is really popular, so I recommend getting reservations.  My friends and I tried going on a Friday night during the week of Burning Man since the city is usually empty during that time.  Though their website says they save tables for walk-ins, that was unfortunately not the case that night as they were fully booked.  So I recommend getting reservations if you plan on dining here.\", \"Stumbled upon this gem on a visit to SF about 1.5 weeks after their official opening. Great decision! My husband and I arrived at 11:30am. It wasn't crowded yet but we opted to sit at the bar which was super fun. Sophie took care of us splendidly. She was so attentive and friendly even when the lunch crowd filled the place up. Really great vibes all around.We had rosé on tap and started with a sampling of raw oysters. The oysters were so fresh and all delicious with a top-notch mignonette. I usually prefer west coast oysters (though I'm an East Coast gal) but the Steubens from Maine were our favorite of the round. We also tried the miso bone marrow baked oysters which were AMAZING and unlike any baked oysters I've ever had. He had the smoked trout salad and declared it his ideal most perfect salad so that was a big win. I had the warm lobster roll with maui onion chips and devoured every bite. Maaaaybe I've had a better lobster roll in my life but outside New England this one was definitely up there. A+ all around. Highly recommend. (In fact, I did recommend it to family we were staying with; they went for dinner later the same day and said they also loved their meal.)\", \"I loved everything about this restaurant!! The moment I arrived at night, it was giving me that West Anderson movie vibe! Everything was so vibrant in color and you literally cannot miss this restaurant on the street of Fillmore, it makes you feel like you are in a hollywood movie.Our server was extremely attentive and took the time to explain every single dish in detail which makes me feel very heartwarming because I could hear the passion from him as he describes the ingredients. I came here after failing an exam so I decided to eat until my heart is content and what is better than trying ALL of their oysters. My favorites are still the Kumamoto and Miyagi but omg their baked oysters are just as bomb. That miso bone marrow and rocket fellew were literally flavor bomb dropped in your mouth with the oilyness with the balance of ocean oyster! The lobster roll was also really good, especially the bread, I mean carb is lifeee. I guess the only thing that was least impressive to me was the roasted nori cauliflower, it was just a bit bland without anything unique about it. Overall, this place is a must if you are an oyster lover and just wanted to enjoy a good night out and pretend you are living in a Hollywood movie or just come and eat after failing an exam like I did hahaOh I forgot to mention, get that Greek yogurt tart, you will not disappoint. It's big enough to be shared by 2-3 people!!\", \"Little shucker was a cute restaurant that recently opened and to my understand women owned, so we went out to celebrate one of our girlfriend's birthday. We were seated promptly, water came quickly and server was attentive throughout the night. We got a dozen of oysters, oyster shooter, crudo, chip and dip, and musses as a main. Everything was fresh and pretty tasty. I though the crudo was a tad salty; but my friends said theirs were fineS maybe it was my area that had an extra dash of salt of some sort. They have outdoor seating which i would recommend, as it was a but loud inside for me. Total was approximately $65-70/person. Would recommend for a date night or girls night out.\", \"Miso.

F O O D* Raw Oysters: Miyagi + Kumamoto (1/2 dozen - $22): https://tinyurl.com/32p4v4sdBoth oysters were fresh, briny, and properly shucked/inspected (no shell fragments). It was served with a nước chấm mignonette that gave it some punch and funk without overpowering the oysters. We ended up ordering another half dozen so yes, they were that good!Make sure to try their housemade hot sauces (red and green). Their green hot sauce (serrano peppers) was great - packed heat while adding a citrusy tang. * Baked Oysters (2 pc - $10 x3)--Rockefeller w/ spinach, pancetta, grana padono: https://tinyurl.com/4dxy8md6Fav of the three, rich and creamy but you can still taste the sweet brininess and silky texture of the oyster.--Garlic Butter w/ chive oil, garlic beurre blanc: https://tinyurl.com/bdfssbr7Just the right amount of savory garlicky-chive flavor to complement the oyster. --Miso Bone Marrow w/ pickled daikon, cilantro: https://tinyurl.com/bdfssbr7Sounded great on paper but it was my least fav of the three. While the bone marrow added a luxe richness, the miso's saltiness was overpowering. It was in no way bad tho...we just preferred the other two baked preps.* Local Halibut Crudo w/ avocado mousse, gooseberry, radish ($16): https://tinyurl.com/4524zj4fLOVED THIS! The pristine cuts of halibut melted like buttah in our mouffs with the gooseberry adding a subtle sweet fruity bite. Perfect example of sourcing and showcasing top-notch ingredients with thoughtfulness and care.* Smoked Salmon Tartine w/ milk bread, dill cream cheese, caper jam ($14): https://tinyurl.com/5222svt7Another winner...pillowy soft milk bread topped with a creamy layer of dill cream cheese, silky sheets of smoked salmon, and lemony tang from the caper jam. Not overly salty. SO good. S E R V I C EFor second day of dinner service, service was very impressive and customer oriented. The staff esp our server, Paul was hitting ALL cylinders - introduced himself, reviewed the menu, asked about food allergies, brought a pour of wine without asking, promptly cleared empty plates, offered fresh plates/utensils between courses, and offered my dog water. Courses were well-paced and presented. We were in/out in an hour (early dinner). A M B I A N C EGreat transformation from The Grove's dark cabin vibes  - it's now hip and bright with a cute seafood counter and bar area. The sidewalk seating (6 tables) is great for people and dog watching. There's overhead heaters but still bring a warm coat if you're dining outside. P A R K I N GVery challenging street parking. Give yourself an extra 15-20 minutes if you're meeting up friends/fam. Overall, excellent seafood resto with 5 star service. It's been a while since I've been to a new resto where they're operating like a well-oiled machine. So, it's no surprise that Little Shucker is the new hot spot in Pac Heights. If you're on the SEEfood diet, they're def worth hitting up!\", \"TLDR Little Shucker was such a fun dining experience. I came with a group of girlfriends and the restaurant is so cute. Has a casual feel that's perfect for oysters with the girlies or a date night. They have created a very trendy but inviting atmosphere. Service is friendly. Food is fresh and delicious. Will definitely return. They also have oyster happy hour Wednesday and Thursday from 3-5. Service was very friendly and attentive. We ordered the Petillant Blanc Avinyó wine, which our server told us is their Spanish Party Wine. Needless to say we were sold. They also coursed out our food and we didn't feel rushed. For the food. Of course we had to get oysters! We tried all three types on the menu. My favorites were the Kumamoto from Tomales Bay. They were sweet and a little briny and so delicious. The oysters are served with a mignonette and two housemate hot sauces. We also loved the baked garlic butter oysters. Other menu highlights smoked salmon tartine with caper jam and a big bowl of mussels in white wine jus with fries. Chips and dip were a fun add but I wouldn't order again. I would also skip the crudo next time I go. Cons, it is very very loud. This restaurant is better for solo dining and groups of 2-4. Above that is incredibly hard to hear at the table.\", \"Very cute spot! During the heat wave we stopped by for some drinks and small bites to cool down. We didn't have a reservation but were seated immediately. The bone marrow baked oysters were divine. We also enjoyed the mussels, fries and cauliflower. The lavender yuzu and vermouth hi ball spritzes were refreshing. The space is bright and cheery. Service was friendly and quick. I saw that they have happy hour on Wednesday and Thursday from 3-5pm and look forward to trying that next!\", \"What an awesome new spot on Fillmore! If we still lived down the street, I would come weekly. We were able to pop in for lunch Saturday and really enjoyed our meal. Great service, bright & beautiful space, and food was yummy. Loved both salads, the garlic oysters (miso ones didn't taste like bone marrow only miso), mussels, and lobster roll. Everything on the menu was right up my alley. Perfect place for lunch on a sunny day with a spritz.\", \"The last place I went similar to this was the new popi's oysterette in marina ..this little shucker has lobster rolls and we all know that I'm an expert lobster roll taster..so this one has to be mastered because the menu is minimal ..serves the seafood platter like $98 and small plates oysters mussels and the lobster roll ..unveiled with roe and crispies and nice buttery roll. ..it's pricey at $33 and thats like two rolls to me and its small....i want a bigger lobster roll and like ten dollars off because they all end up tasting the same ..this is woodhouse fish co competitor ..nice interior..light and california style seafood ..u know i would eat a lobster roll everyday ...in maine..this little piggy wants more seafood20% surcharge is a ripoff for me..the bill for a roll and coke was $50..rip off prices.\", 'We visited LS during their first week of operations where only lunch service is offered. Dinner service will be available next week, after 8/9. Lots of excitement & anticipation after reading about LS in SF Standard. The LS team did a great job transforming the former Grove space that featured lots of dark wood panels, into a beautiful, sun bathed dining room.We started off with cocktails (I had the lavender spritz which was so light & refreshing that I ordered a second one). My friend had the white wine spritz which she enjoyed a lot. We shared a dozen oysters of all 3 varieties, which were super fresh & tasty. Our favorite was the miso bone marrow baked oysters. A unique combination of flavors that worked in harmony. The smoked trout salad was flavorful & not too smoky or salty & the buttermilk dressing was the perfect combination to the texture of the frisée salad. The local halibut crudo was delicate with mild flavors. The roasted nori cauliflower was a nice, flavorful & healthy dish.Service was excellent - warm, friendly & helpful. I will definitely be back soon!', \"really cool new spot in pacific heights on fillmore - definitely has a nice ambiance w big windows, lots of outdoor seating, and warm lighting. made a reservation here about a week in advance, can be difficult to get one at a reasonable time so had to monitor notifications for a while.we ordered the lobster roll, garlic baked oysters, kumamoto oysters, and the mussels. of all of them, would say the mussels had the best value for taste - came with ~15-20 mussels and the sauce was delicious.the lobster roll was also amazing, but for the price, i can't say it's entirely worth it. it's pretty small and likely isn't enough for a full meal.overall, glad i got to try it out and the food was great - however, ended up being about ~$70pp which feels like too much for the amount you get. would advise coming during happy hour to get the best value!!\", \"Can I just say.. wow. Took me right back to Lisbon! The atmosphere here as well has a very sleek/modern European seafood restaurant vibe (if you've been to Portugal or Spain, you'll appreciate this reference)! The service was spectacular, I could not have felt more at home from the hostess at the door - to the servers at the bar, all the way to the food runners. They're a fun, lively group that have great chemistry and work well together! Exceptionally kind people. Hats off to whoever is doing the hiring!Okay.. now for the food. From the raw bar, I ordered the Kumamoto, garlic butter with caviar and miso bone marrow baked oysters. The Kumamoto were amazing, very light brininess and a little fruity and sweet. Perfect for anyone that's unsure what to order, these are a great start. I then worked my way to the garlic butter baked oysters with caviar and OH MY GOODNESS, I will be coming back specifically for them but next time I will be getting myself a dozen. I can not recommend these enough. The miso bone marrow was recommended by my sweet waitress so I gave them a shot. I would say they are on the salty side (miso, obviously) but I'm glad I tried them but would probably stick to the Rockefeller or garlic ones next time. On the small plate, I ordered the salmon tartine! It was really good, very fulfilling and a good size to share with another person! I paired everything with a glass of petillant blanc, because like I mentioned.. this place just takes you back to the coast of Spain and why not pull the whole experience together with cold glass of Spanish wine! Perfect pairing if you ask me. Enjoyed my dining experience here. You will love this place!!\", \"Very cute place to eat! Small restaurant on Fillmore street. Loved the oysters and their special sauces (especially the green sauce!) but my favorite thing on the menu was the specialty baked scallops (not sure what they put in there but its SO GOOD)! The lobster roll was up to standards. Only thing was that all the portions were very small and there's not that many choices on the menu (I wish they had more mains to choose from)! Loved the service too!\", \"What a cool spot!  My friend took me here for my birthday and it's super fabulous.  We shared two dozen oysters, two bottles of sparkling wine, a salad, two apps and a dessert.  Kinda pricy but so worth the money.  The ingredients are super good quality.  The service beyond awesome; Dylan and Zola were so friendly and attentive.  The ambiance screams low key but fab!  I would definitely come back again. Side note: didn't see much parking but it's the city; just walk or uber.\", \"This is a very lively spot, came here to eat after a 7mile walk around the Golden Gate Park.  Got to sit right in front of the Oyster lady (bar area) busy shucking away she works hard!!!.  Ordered the 12 oysters and tried them all. The Marin Miyagi and Kumamoto were the best ones.  First time having the petit maman and I never knew fresh oysters can be creamy like that it was different and good but I prefer the others. The smoked trout salad was refreshing. I enjoyed the Caviar service though it was slightly different than others I've tried.  Bone marrow miso baked oysters were a hit. I'd say a great place to have light and small bites but recommend making a resy, this place gets busy!\", \"Have been looking forward to this place opening, and it's so cute! Good amount of seating inside and nice outdoor seating as well. Perfect for a date or an afternoon catch up. We just stopped by for some oysters and spritz's/ wine at about 2pm on a Sunday and we're seated outside right away. the spritz's are so beautifully done- my friend got the lavender yuzu ($13) which came out a beautiful purple- said it was good. Also got a white wine which was the perfect pairing for the 2 dozen oysters ($39/dozen) we got. Oysters were very fresh and mignotte was good. Service was very friendly and quick. Definitely a bit on the pricier side, but would love to try some of their other food and dessert (chocolate budino!).\", 'Was very excited to come here today - made a reservation for 5:30pm on Resy but had to push back, thankfully they were able to accommodate (requested the change via Email). Got seated promptly and service was lovely and all the servers were very friendly and attentive.For the ambiance, the inside of the restaurant does not inspire as much joy as the branding and vibe suggests - I was seated facing the wall (not a cute view) and gave my bf the booth so he could see a cute view of the place behind me. I liked the rounded edges and corners on the tables and the interior was very clean and minimalist and simple, maybe so the food on the blue plates and colorful drinks could pop?We got some drinks (lavender yuzu and pink spritz) and both were great. I love when places have clear ice, it just shows that slight attention to detail. For the main event - the food - I was excited by the menu and wanted to try everything but had to pare it down since I wasn\\'t super hungry. I got one of each oyster (delicious, so fresh) and the baked miso bone marrow oysters. Do not pass on these baked oysters they are SO good and creamy and warm. The flavors were amazing and all very compatible. The lobster roll was also good (I wish they had a crab roll) and the bread was nice and buttery but nothing to write home about so at $35 I probably wouldn\\'t get it again. I thought the roasted cauliflower was delicious with a subtle toasty briny flavor but for my bf it was too subtle. My boyfriend isn\\'t a raw seafood person so he got the Caesar with chicken and unfortunately the chicken was extremely dry. I know I know why would you order chicken at a seafood restaurant? But still if it\\'s going to be offered at least deliver on it! Overall I give it a 4/5 - fun menu items and drinks but slightly lacking in ambiance. But don\\'t get me wrong I\\'ll definitely be back for more oysters and to try more of the rest of the menu! And I appreciate that the 20% of subtotal is included as a service fee and they don\\'t have anywhere for an \"optional, additional\" tip on top that still makes the consumer feel awkward if they skip it.', \"My wife & I put our name down for about a 30 minute wait to be seated on a Saturday afternoon! Wait time was unsurprising given how busy Littler Shucker always looks.We ordered a glass of wine and Spritz - no complaints here.For food, we ordered 12 oysters to share, along with the roasted cauliflower and halibut crudo. Highly recommend trying all 3; The Cauliflower was our favorite, it was roasted perfectly and the flavor was great. Next time, I definitely want to come back and try the mussels and lobster roll.Service was great, and interior decor was on point. I concur with a lot of the other reviews posted for Little Shucker, it's certainly worth the hype and experience.\", 'Hello james is signing in came to complain about how small the shuckers were unbelievable service aswell']\n",

      "Reviews: [\"My bestfriend and I went to this restaurant before a show and it was such a great choice! Our server Christine truly went above and beyond, making sure we ordered things we'd like and even remembered when we told her we had to leave at a certain time to catch our show. Wish we could've talked to the owners to let them know how amazing she was! She and the other staff made the experience so much more memorable. For apps we ordered beef and cheese empanadas and arugula salad. For mains we ordered the beet rigatoni and mushroom burger. We also ordered 3 diff cocktails, all very well made, but the 10/10 fave was the black noir. My friend who doesn't like sweet drinks was so in love w the black noir cocktail, so highly rec. Overall food was super good, but my fave dish was the beef empanadas!!The atmosphere of the restaurant was aesthetically pleasing and cute. I hope they end up getting full bar service, so FYI they only have soju based cocktails, and wine I believe. Which was great, but I do like more typical cocktails as well.\", \"Lovely staff and service and the drinks were amazing but the food was just okay. I really want them to be successful but the flavors need some punch.The rigatoni was wild but pretty good. Steak was good not great. The chicken was pretty good. Beef tacos were our favorite app. Dessert we didn't order but the offerings seemed odd too.\", \"We went here last night since we live a few blocks away.  Service was 5 stars, never had to ask for anything but some of the menu items need to be reworked - our food was mediocre at best and a bit overpriced for what we got.  Thai Curry Chicken was definitely missing something (it was very bland).  Noticed someone else gave the same review but wasn't even acknowledged by the Manager.  Wasn't a fan of the chickpea puree since it just made the already bland curry sauce even more bland.  Could have used more vegetables and flavor in the curry sauce as well.  Salmon was served with a block of beans which seemed like a strange choice instead of some seasonal vegetables or something with more flavor and color.  It was a brownish piece of salmon with brown pile of refried beans....Not sure we would go back here again.\", \"Memento was a great spot to meet a friend for drinks and dinner. It has a cozy chic vibe, shareable plates, and amazing cocktails. The mussels are the best I've ever had with a decadent, creamy sauce made of Thai coconut milk, white wine, lime and curry. The Salmon Tartare was great with the avocado on the bottom and ponzo aioli plus the side of crispy, fried empanada chips. We also really liked the Crispy Skin Salmon which had great flavor and went so well with the side of fava bean purée. The coconut fudge pie was fine but a little chewy for me. I personally loved the cocktail menu as there were so many inventive, soju-based drinks. We ordered two of the sweeter, fruitier ones, the Berry Me and the Holiday on the Moon (topped with a cookie!) They were also low-ABV though they tasted so good that I definitely drank more than usual.\", 'Cool new spot in Noe for an upscale dining experience.  Service was spectacular right from the time we got there and loved that they welcome everyone with a complimentary shot (tasty and not too strong).  For appetizers we ordered the flatbread, salmon tartare, beef and cheese empanadas, and zucchini fries (special for that day).  The salmon tartare was my favorite as it had a generous portions of salmon and avocado.  The flat bread kind of reminded me of a soggy microwave pizza and was my least favorite.   For mains we had the beet rigatoni and the curry chicken.  I appreciated the originality and presentation of the rigatoni, but it was somewhat light in flavor.  The curry chicken also felt like it was missing something. For desert we had the lime mouse and the flan.  Both were excellent and were devoured in minutes. Overall, they have good food and even better service.  We enjoyed our meal and would consider coming back.', 'Was here on a date night and what i can actually say. The atmosphere is fascinating - absolutely careful servers and great service. For sure its a place where everyone cares about your feelings and no one never will make you to order something you will never like. Drinks and food are amazing for sure! try it', 'Great food, engaging service, super cool ambiance. The owner was working behind the bar and provided fascinating conversation all night while serving up delicious food and wine with a Brazilian panache.', 'Such a lovely new addition to the neighborhood. We were seated at the bar and had a great time conversing with the owners and other patrons. Raf is an artist behind the bar and takes great care in his preparations, while Suhair is the life of the place! We had the Zucchini sticks and Salmon tartare for appetizers, the Crispy chicken was a main course followed by the Flan. Everything was delicious but the standouts for us were the Salmon tartare and the Flan. The drinks were also very well made and we will back here soon!', \"Came with some friends on a Thursday night. We made a reservation ahead of time, which I would recommend because it's a small space. We were greeted with a shot of a specialty drink of theirs, which was very nice. We ordered a variety of appetizers- loved the Shishito peppers and the zucchini fries (off the menu). I ordered the salmon as my main and my boyfriend got the rigatoni. The salmon was solid, but if I could order only one thing again, I'd get the beet rigatoni- it was the perfect combination of flavors!\", \"This is IT! The perfect neighborhood eatery. The food is delicious. Approachable but elevated. And you MUST save room for dessert...We were lucky enough to be invited to the soft opening. Now I can't wait to be here every Friday after work for snacks and cocktails!\", \"Was looking for somewhere new to try with my partner and I stumbled upon this gem!Service was warm and friendly, ambience was very sleek, and overall we were more than satisfied with all the dishes we got.Even though I loved everything we ate, I'll forsure be thinking about the filet mignon and coconut fudge cake long after this meal! We most certainly will be back and are so excited to try the other dishes this restaurant has to offer! Definitely a restaurant worth checking out!\", \"We were lucky enough to experience Memento SF opening week and it was very special. They have a great location with easy parking (which is not easy in the city).  I'll start off with the list of creative and delicious cocktails that they have are top notch, it was so difficult to decide which one to try first, my personal favorit Black Noir,  a smoky and unique drink , I wanted more. I had the Salmon Tartare and the Crispy curry chicken AMAZING and I was able to try more that were delicious. Overall it was an amazing experience, great restaurant , ambiance and service. Date night or dinner with friends this place is great.\", 'My partner and I happened upon this restaurant by chance and I am so glad we did! Walking in we immediately remarked on the aesthetic and how it was our kind of spot. We had cocktails and a small bite at the bar, and both left a big impression! Every member of staff that we interacted with were so attentive and kind, and made us feel as if we were old friends. Absolutely looking forward to our next visit!', \"Dinner @memento.sf was fantastic. The menu is eclectic which means something for everyone. For a small-ish space, the ambiance is lovely. The waitstaff is kind and attentive. Great service. I'm excited to return. 1. You Had Me at Hello #cocktail2. Za'atar flatbread which has a perfect flavor3. Salmon #tartare was plate licking my good.4. Heirloom tomato and arugula salad with a generous portion of avocado 5. Shared Lime Mousse dessert with a raspberry compote that was light and refreshing.\", \"It's all about the details...We really enjoyed our first dining experience at Momento SF. The service from the second we approached the door to the moment we walked out was impeccable.  It really felt like fine dining service within a neighborhood spot. The comfy space felt both fresh and intimate.  I'm a fan of a smaller unique menu filled with thoughtful dishes over a fluffed menu that tries to please the masses.  The amuse-bouche-like beverage arriving shortly after sitting down was great to sip while perusing the menu. The food was beautifully presented and delicious. Momento SF is a  much needed addition to the Noe Valley neighborhood.  We look forward to supporting this new business in the very near future.\", 'Delicious! The food has a unique flavor that all blends together beautifully. The presentation is spectacular. The cocktails are super different and comes with a fun twist with the garnishing and design. A lot of fun, you want to try all of them. The decor is stunning and I like the soft lighting. The beef tacos to start and the rigatoni was yummy and I am excited to try more. A nice place for a date, a celebration or just because. So glad this special restaurant is in the neighborhood.', 'Great food and ambiance. The staff is very attentive. The mignon was perfectly cooked and tasted amazing!', \"This was such a treat! I came here to celebrate my partner's birthday. Memento is somewhere where you can talk, eat, and enjoy the good ambiance. I was so immersed in conversation and the food that I didn't get a chance to snap a picture of the food or bar! :)The service was impeccable: they are extremely friendly and attentive here. I ordered the Portobello Mushroom Burger and it came with Truffle fries. The brioche bun was so tasty. And the fries were thin cut, delicious, and topped with a sprinkle of cheese. Would order again, because the burger was good but the fries blew my mind. What a great addition to Noe Valley.\", 'Awesome cocktails. Highly recommended. Ok I have to write something else because of the stupid yelp rule.', \"A small but inviting space to enjoy fine dining, great service and personal attention from the owner. Happy Noe Valley has another good restaurant. Only complaint: no decaf coffee but they'll have it soon\", 'So lovely, we initially booked for bar seating but they were able to accommodate us at a table (we are not picky at all but it was super sweet!) our server Dustin was amazing so friendly even though it was for sure busy for them. Cocktails and wine were delicious, we had the truffle fries and beet pasta- both were bomb. We are so excited to come back!', \"My husband & I finally got to try Memento SF and everything has exceeded our expectations! From the delicious mouth watering menu, the top-notch service, to the warm & cozy ambiance, the entire experience was perfected! We tried the mussels (and of course we paired it with the truffle fries!), the salmon tartare, and the filet mignon, and all were exceptional and delicious! And can we talk about the incredible cocktail menu please?! Each drink was meticulously garnished and presented with flair, turning your evening into a visual delight. I had berry me and my hubby had Holiday on the moon cocktail and both were perfectly balanced and delicious! For desserts, we tried the lime mousse and the caramel flan and both were to die for! We can't wait to go back and try more items on the menu. Whether you're celebrating a special occasion or simply seeking an extraordinary dining experience, this hidden new gem is a must-visit destination in San Francisco.\", 'We sat at the bar.  Service and people were great.  Food was good with a variety of small plates and entrees.  Very unique and tasty cocktails.', 'LOVED my first Memento experience and will definitely be coming back again. Everything from the ambiance to the cocktails, starters, mains and desserts was exceptional. Salmon Tartar and truffle fries are a must, the beets rigatoni was delish (the added touch of ricotta on top is genius), and my oh my the coconut fudge pie!', 'Food is great, tasty, and fresh. The service is excellent and the staff is very nice. I defiently recommend!', \"It was a most enjoyable experience from start to finish. After we were greeted warmly, we sat and enjoyed a complimentary Memento shot which was delicious. I could've had a full cocktail size one of these but we were on a tight schedule. We started with a couple of appetizers, the truffle fries and zucchini fries and they were done to perfection. The best fries I've had in a long time!  We (three of us) had different main courses (beet pasta, portobello mushroom burger, and sous vide crispy chicken) and we all raved about our selections.   Because we had time constraints, we were going to forgo the dessert.  But because everything was so good, we had to try one. The lime mousse was epic!  We are so happy Memento is part of our Noe Valley restaurant scene. The only area that could use improvement was the limited wine selection. The wines offered weren't great (we had 3 different red wines) but were of course drinkable.  The restaurant had a mellow vibe playing nice music in the background. The service was attentive and friendly. It was a 5 star experience.\", 'Making a reservation was super quick and easy and both the food and service were AMAZING!', 'Met the owners, Suhair & Rafael, who told us a bit about their inspiration for the place, how they met in NYC, and some of the art they made personally on their walls. Only stopped by for some low-ABV cocktails, which honestly blew us away (Live-smoked cinamon with a blowtorch! Neat!) For a snack, they had fried zucchini sourced from their family nearby, and it made us happy to know how excited the owners\\' mom was to have folks enjoying veggies from her garden. Owners were more like kind hosts than \"proprietors\". Gonna take my mom here next!', \"Tried this restaurant in the first week that it opened and was so impressed! Everything was delicious -- particularly the salmon tartare and the mushroom burger. The drinks were especially creative and delicious. The service was so great and it was really fun how excited everyone was to be opening this restaurant. Just altogether a special and delicious experience. It's right away a new favorite!\"]\n",

      "Reviews: [\"My culinary compass pointed me towards the newly opened Collina, and let me tell you, friends, I wasn't disappointed. This restaurant is like a love letter to Italian food, written with fresh ingredients, passion, and a generous dash of creativity.First up, the spaghettini - a classic done right. Al dente perfection swimming in a pool of garlicky, buttery goodness. Simple, yet oh-so satisfying. It's like the Beyoncé of the pasta world - flawless, but somehow outshone by its equally talented sisters.Speaking of which, the lasagnette stole the show. Picture this: crispy, golden edges giving way to layers of melt-in-your-mouth pasta, bathed in a rich, meaty ragu that could bring a tear to your eye. Each bite was a symphony of textures and flavors, a culinary masterpiece in its own right.And then there was the tiramisu. Oh, the tiramisu. Forget everything you thought you knew about this Italian dessert. Collina's version is a revelation. Light, fluffy, and bursting with coffee and cocoa, it's like a cloud of pure happiness. I'm not exaggerating when I say it's the best tiramisu I've ever had.If you're looking for a new Italian restaurant in San Francisco, look no further than Collina. It's a place where the food is so good, it speaks for itself. Just be prepared to be blown away by the lasagnette and tiramisu - you've been warned!\", \"Stepping into this enchanting Italian eatery was like stumbling upon a gastronomic haven. From the moment I crossed the threshold, I knew I was in for a culinary treat. The ambiance exuded warmth and sophistication, creating the perfect backdrop for an unforgettable dining experience.Now, let's talk about the star of the show - the lasagnette bolognese. I can confidently say that this dish has redefined my expectations of Italian cuisine. The layers of pasta, meticulously crafted and delicately seasoned, harmonize with the velvety bolognese sauce, creating a symphony of flavors that dance on the palate. Each bite is a journey through Italy, a celebration of culinary artistry.What truly sets this restaurant apart is the commitment to excellence evident in every aspect. The service is not just attentive; it's a seamless dance of hospitality that elevates the entire dining experience. The staff, passionate about their craft, took the time to explain each dish with enthusiasm, enhancing our appreciation for the culinary creations before us.The menu, a carefully curated selection of Italian delights, showcases a culinary prowess that extends beyond the famed lasagnette.\", \"We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Collina. We live nearby and go to Seven Hills all the time so we were excited to try their sister restaurant in their old location.The ambiance is cozy, a bit dark but in a romantic way. The waiters are knowledgeable and funny. There are lots of lovely candles. We started with the mushroom toast, arancini and Brussel sprouts. The arancini were absolutely fantastic - crispy garlicky cheesy. Brussel sprouts were good not amazing but nice to have a vegetable. They were not fried but were roasted and topped with Parmesan, so a bit lighter than many restaurants.The mushroom toast was a bit too rich - too much crème fraiche such that it became soggy.For our mains, we shared the lasagna and the spaghettini. Both were absolutely amazing. The spaghetti was flavorful with fresh basil yet light. The lasagna was richer - it was unlike any lasagna I've ever had. I'm not a lasagna fan usually but this was fantastic. It was a meaty lasagna where the noodles got crispy - not a red sauce but a meaty bolognese. Lastly, we shared the butterscotch pudding for dessert - so delicious. Not a pudding or even dessert person - but it was amazing! Definitely coming back\", \"There is nothing better than dining out with your foodie friends and trying basically everything on a menu. That was my experience at Collina and I loved every bite. It's the type of neighborhood restaurant that made me wish I could live down the street and visit often. From the moment we walked in, the staff was very welcoming and friendly. Our server was on top of making sure we paced out our courses well. While a lasagnette and Raviolo Al uovo were delicious, the spaghettini really stood out to me. This simple dish was perfectly executed and really was the item that I kept think of after our meal. This is a great place for a date night, especially since it has such a dark interior. Make a reservation since this is a fairly small place, and bring friends so you can enjoy a number of their offerings.\", 'Service was excellent! Appreciated meeting the GM, Danny, who genuinely loved the neighborhood and business. Small, cozy environment. We enjoyed the focaccia, arancini (4), little gem salad, scallops (4), and lasagnette. All delicious!', \"My boyfriend and I are big Seven Hills fans. As soon as we heard about Collina, we knew we had to come. We came here on opening weekend and the restaurant was pretty much full. The ambiance is elegant and a bit more chic/trendy than Seven Hills. Great for a date night. For dinner, we ordered the following items: little gem salad, arancini, della fatoria toast, and lasagnette. Everything was amazing, but the arancini and lasagnette definitely stood out. I could honestly say that their arancini and lasagnette are the best I've had in SF. The della fatoria toast was also very high up there for us. Another huge plus is that corkage is only $25!! Most nice restaurants in SF charge $35+, so we were pleasantly surprised. The only reason I'm docking off half a star (4.5, rounding up to 5) is because of the portions. At Seven Hills, the pasta portions are so generous that we always have leftovers; but at Collina, we left ~70% full with the small lasagnette portion. All in all, I'd highly recommend giving Collina a try. Service is welcoming and attentive, which definitely makes the experience that much better. We'll definitely be back!\", \"Date night! The 'lasagnette' was the star of the show. Think a 20 or so layer cake of lasagna bolognese of which you receive about a two inch thick slice of. Tuna tartare with nori chips was extremely bland, though - avoid this dish. Brick-cooked chicken was very good and juicy but not amazing in any way - just a solid chicken dish. Service was fantastic!This was opening night so I'm sure there will be some tweaks to the menu/recipes along the way. Wish them the best of luck!\", \"The food and service at Collina is just ok. For the price, I'd suggest trying other restaurants in the neighborhood first. We were there for my birthday, which my husband noted on the reservation. I wasn't expecting the red carpet or a free dessert or anything, but a friendly greeting/acknowledgment would've been nice (as most other restaurants do for special occasions). It's those little things that can make an experience all the better. I got the Americano Spritz(?), tasted like a weird Kool-Aid, the focaccia bread was soft but cold, the salad was the better part of our meal, but our main dishes - the spaghettini and scallops were ok, in a 'it's not bad' kinda way. Overall we were very disappointed. I didn't even want to take a chance on dessert, so we got the hell out of there and went across the street to another restaurant instead.\", 'Collina is the quintessential neighborhood restaurant:  charming, welcoming setting; friendly, attentive staff; and, absolutely delicious food!  Collina is the little sister to Seven Hills, which is also a rare gem among SF restaurants; but, Collina is more quaint.The menu represents a perfect offering of everything you would want to eat:  phenomenal pastas--the lasagna is better than your Italian grandmother made; the spaghettini is equally delicious!  The chicken is luscious as are the scallops.  We were a party of four and ordered half of the items on the menu:  we ate family style and shared each serving.  We finished with Tiramisu, which put the ! on a perfect meal in a perfect setting.', \"Congrats Collina staff and Chefs Florian & Diaz on the beautiful execution of this boutique, comfortable, and exciting space to be in, again! My flatmates and I went out for a Friday night and Collina was the best start of the night. What we ordered: Fattoria Toast, Little Gem Salad, Lasagnette, Raviolo al Uvo, Butterball Potatos, & both desserts.First off, the staff was so helpful in helping us decide and letting us know what items of the menu have been most popular. It's so fun to hear the stories behind dishes like the Raviolo al Uvo and its' return to the plate from Seven Hills' menu. Everything was good! The toast had the most fresh, sweet, and perfectly seasoned tomatoes. The bread was toasted to literal perfection and still soaked up enough juices from the tomatoes. Little gem salad NEVER fails - well seasoned, with a Koto 'La cheese which did a good enough job to uplift the flavor. Honestly, the seasoning of the salad was the best part. Raviolo came out alone, which was less than ideal because both housemates aren't really big fans of runny eggs. They had to wait a while for food to come...considering all the dishes were Primi we were a bit confused. Raviolo was rich, well balanced with the chard on the side. My only wish is that the raviolo could speak for itself instead of being drowned with sauces & fats because the flavour is so fresh. The desserts were rich and portioned on the larger side. No complaints from a table who is sharing. Oh how could I forget - Lasagnette. We ordered two and wow the portioning was perfect. The bolognese ragu was perfectly stewed and balanced well with the richness of the cheese and spinach. Worth the price for sure and an interesting dish.I'm excited to keep an eye on Collina's menu and return to try some more amazing food.4.8/5 - im sure they'll be next to perfect once they iron out the details\", \"So excited to have Collina in the Russian Hill hood - such a lovely spot from the Seven Hills family. - The lasagnette is the dish that we can't stop dreaming about- Loved the raviolo, green goddess salad, tuna tartare, and spaghettini - The service is superb, makes you feel welcome and super at homeThank you Collina, we can't wait to come back!!\", 'Very intimate environment and very attentive staff Tasteful menu.We ordered Arancini,Della FattoriaToast it was so goodWould recommened. I am vegetarian i ordered Raviolo Al UOVO and the Spaghetti it was so good and perfect.Dessert was dilicious and pair well with dessert wine too.', 'Found this new spot as I was walking on Hyde and it looked very charming so decided to try it out. Sure enough, great ambiance, service, and food. The Lasagnette was absolutely delicious.', 'This is an Awesome spot. I Can t wait to go back to try more of the menu. I highly recommend it as a romantic date night place.', \"My husband and I had dinner at Collina, my favorites was the lasagne. I was expecting the ravioli to be the star, it didn't disappoint, but the chef really surprised me with that lasagna being so amazing.  We also had scallops and a salad.  The ambiance and staff, made the experience really special. Can't wait to go back. The staff seemed like a team that had worked together for a long time, not like a usual opening night.\", 'Great addition to the neighborhood. The lasagnette was incredible - go for this alone. Also loved the ravioli and tiramisu. Super charming spot with the cable cars riding by.', \"Came to Collina for a family dinner and had a fantastic experience all round. They hit the trifecta from the food to the service and the a ambiance. It's an A+ across the board. The lasagnette really stood out as its as unique as it is delicious with an unfathomable amount of layers of fresh house made pasta that's then seared on one side and served on top parmigiana sauce. We also loved the Raviolo Uvov. Never had a dish quite like it before. Amazing. Then finished with the Tiramisu for the perfect end to the perfect night. Actually ordered 2 more before we left. Can't wait to go back for more.\", 'The food, ambiance, and service was outstanding! This place truly is a delicious gem! I highly recommend the 48 layer lasagna that just melts in your mouth! I absolutely love this restaurant']\n",

He was not assigned to our table but he helped us from beginning to end .', 'Everything here was excellent from the food to the ambiance to the service. Luis took care of us and was attentive, receptive, and friendly!', \"Fog Harbor is located on the second floor of Pier 39 overlooking the Fisherman's Wharf strip. We went at night and were fortunate to get a window seat with direct view spanning the Wharf area with the new ferris wheel all the way to the Golden Gate. Very beautiful.Although being in a major tourist location, the restaurant with sitting bar acts and runs like a well oiled mid range establishment you would find in any downtown loacation. We had a 15 minute wait so we sat at the bar and had a drink, I recommend the Fog Harbor Lager if you like the easy drinking stuff.Our menu:Blue cheese bread - buttery, cheesy, garlicky goodness. Will always order this!Crab cakes - Super fresh and meaty.Clam Chowder - amongst the best we have had in SF.Cioppino - No noodles, just fish. Extremely fresh and amazing fish with garlic toast in a tomato broth. Sooo good. As for Shawn, our waiter, he should be next up for employee of the month because he was personal, interactive and made us laugh. Bravo sir!The prices are a tiny bit scary not Halloween scary, actually very reasonable for a tourist area.\", 'Our server was fantastic and other staff was friendly. Another employee stopped by to help me tie my bib. I personally had a great experience celebrating my birthday. The calamari was great and we had the seafood platter for 2 , the shrimp was someOf the best tasting shrimp my personal favorite seafood of the smorgasbord. The pasta complimented the rest of the meal- yummy!Pleasantly intimate atmosphere for being in a touristy spot.', 'We asked Google where to find the best clam chowder. We were not disappointed. Everything was great.First off, our server \"Bong Jovi\" was delightful. Very helpful and very attentive. Old school service at a great venue.Everyone was helpful. The restaurant was full, but everyone was attentive. Our used plates were quickly cleared by whoever happened to walk by. Even the manager stopped by to ask how our meal was, and HE took a plate.We started with crab cakes (amazing) and blue cheese bread (delicious).Claim chowder was the best we\\'ve ever had. It had the texture of mashed potatoes,  and the most amazing tastes.Half an order of fresh oysters were delicious, and a lobster roll too. Sadly we left no room for dessert, but we did see the dessert tray and it looked good enough to come back just for dessert. There are a lot of restaurants on the Pier. This is one you should not miss.', \"Hubby and I recently got the chance to try out Fog Harbor Fish House! It's been on our list of spots to check out in SF for awhile. Luckily, his sister has been here several times and spoke very highly of this restaurant.RESERVATIONS: Recommended! Fog Harbor is top rated on Yelp when you search SF. It's in a prime location therefore we highly suggest making reservations.AMBIANCE: Casual with amazing views of the bay. The restaurant has big glass windows around its entirety overlooking the bay. Even on their patio, they have dividers that give you privacy but you also get beautiful views of the bay and the bridge. MENU/FOOD: They have a large selection of foods as well as a seasonal menu. The average prices were $20-$50 per plate. We each opted for their clam chowder and also for their lobster ravioli, clam linguine with alfredo sauce, and mixed grill. All of these items came in fairly large portions, large enough to share. The clam chowder here is very delicious. Very creamy and loaded with so much clam. They gave complimentary sourdough rolls which complemented the chowder. The clam linguine is also creamy and the linguine is cooked to a perfect al dente. The lobster ravioli was superb. The ravioli skin was soft and held flavorful bites of lobster with ricotta. The lobster tasted so fresh! As for the mixed grill, it was our favorite! We substituted the shrimp for more salmon. The salmon was very tender and the seasoning on the salmon was out of this world. We couldn't get enough of it! The mashed potatoes were very creamy and the grilled vegetables were very refreshing with a hint of lemon. OVERALL EXPERIENCE: Easily one of our top favorite restaurants at SF officially. We understand the high ratings behind Fog Harbor now. The food is outstanding and the service was great. They were very accommodating towards us by opening their patio for us to enjoy a meal with our pug. Even though we were the only party outside, our waitress made sure we were well taken care of. We couldn't stop talking about the amazing food and experience here at Fog Harbor. We will always stop by here anytime we visit SF moving forward!\", \"I was finally able to come back to this fantastic restaurant and this time, I brought nine family members with me. I spent the day talking this place up and hoped they wouldn't make a liar out of me.I'm happy to report that they lived up to the hype once again. Everybody at the table, including my mom who's a bit picky, loved Fog Harbor.I went with a cup of the clam chowder (never come here without ordering at least the cup) as a starter and the filet mignon with potato mash and wilted spinach as my entree.I've been to many steak houses and can honestly say the filet mignon I had here was among the best I've had. It was cooked to perfection and while I don't feel it needed it, the delicious demi glaze took it up a notch.We're currently planning a trip to the city this spring with our closest friends for their anniversary and I've already decided to treat them to dinner here. Seriously, I can't say enough. Great experience every time.\", 'We\\'re giving FOG HARBOR the TOP Five 5 Star rating based on a few factors.First off, it has to fight the stigma of residing in Pier 39, known by locals in SF as a \"tourist trap\" type location.  It\\'s actually high quality as an experience and the food portions, taste and prices are fair.  We were expecting to be gauged and get sub-part quality being at Pier 39.If this relocated to any other area in SF, it would probably be at the top of many local\\'s lists, especially if parking was easy and traffic wasn\\'t gridlocked to get to.So, if you\\'re a tourist and see this place and worry about it being questionable with so many other choices, the right decision is to look at the menu first and if you see stuff you like, go here and don\\'t roll the dice on other places which may not give you a solid experience as Fog Harbor does and has/had for us.We\\'re locals in SF but came with visiting tourists, and everyone was happy.We had the Clam Chowder and one comment on the table was it wasn\\'t \"Salty\" (a negative would be being salty) and that it was served \"Hot\" (and that\\'s a good trait to be piping hot and allowed to cool down rather than come warm and end up being cold.We had the Halibut, Sole and Swordfish without any complaints and completely empty plates after indulging in the entrees.Yeah, they charge the dreaded \"5% SF Employee Mandate \"Tax\" Surcharge\" which I think all San Francisco restaurants do, on top of the 8.625% sales tax then whatever you end up tipping... so you are leaving paying 30%+ more than the menu list price on everything.  That\\'s more of a comment on the state of San Francisco\\'s policies than anything this restaurant can control or is at any blame for.The service was friendly, fast and accommodating.  They asked about food allergies and tastes/dislikes ahead of ordering, being very conscientious of their customers needs.They give complimentary rolls and butter which is always a huge plus never to be taken for granted.On a weekend night, you can find street parking for under $1 an hour as opposed to parking in the Pier 39 parking structure or paid parking lots.I\\'d recommend this spot to all.', \"This restaurant is so beautiful as you get to sit right by the pier. The waiters are so friendly and will provide great service. This place is such a great date spot or a nice place to eat. The seafood here is so fresh. Seared Pacific Cod - 4/5- the garbanzo beans overpowered the cod itself however if you ate the cod on its own with the aioli it tastes amazing. the fish was so fresh which made this dish more rich and flavorful. I'd highly recommended this if you are craving cod. Shrimp Brochette - 5/5- the shrimp was beautifully cooked. the butter had such a rich smell and when you put it on the shrimp it tasted amazing. the mashed potatoes were a bit bland but the green beans were cooked so well. Crab Ravioli- 4/5- the ravioli itself was very cheesy and the crab pieces on top tasted amazing. the whole dish was amazing overall but it was a bit too greasy for me. you also only get 4 large pieces of ravioli Calamari- 5/5- you could tell the calamari is fresh and not stored in the frozen fridge for over a month. it had a nice texture and it was perfectly fried.Overall i would come back here because the food is amazing and the ambience is so nice.\", \"Visited Fog Harbor for the first time as my mother was visiting the city! Both of is are pretty serious seafood lovers and I have to say, Fog Harbor didn't disappoint!It was prime dinnertime around 6:30, but we had a reservation so seating wasn't an issue whatsoever. We got seated with a beautiful view of the water and got busy ordering!To start, we got the blue cheese garlic bread which was surprisingly good. I'm not usually a blue cheese person but I found these toasty and more importantly, yummy. I will say though it's a big portion, and it was definitely too much for just my mother and I, but that's a good thing! 7.5/10For mains, I ordered the Shellfish Platter which was this huge assortment of shellfish with a slice of toasted bread and warm garlic butter noodles beneath it all. Once again, it was a huge serving I barely finished and it was really good! It was a tad on the oily end, but I'd recommend it if you love all things shellfish! 8/10Lastly, my mother ordered the scallop and crab risotto and this was the star of the table. It was fluffy and full of flavor, the scallops were seared to perfection, and I couldn't help but keep stealing bites! 9/10Overall, Fog Harbor is a super solid seafood spot with good views, great food, and excellent service. Would highly recommend it if you love seafood!\", 'Such a wonderful spot! We got the clam chowder bowl with the sourdough bread and crab meat. This was my first time trying clam chowder and we absolutely loved it. We accompanied our lunch with calamari. I would definitely come here again and recommend to anyone checking Pier 39 out! Wait was 15-20 minutes to be seated on a Saturday in November, so not at all bad.', \"This is a must-visit for seafood lovers. Their Cioppino is packed with a variety of fresh seafood in a flavorful tomato broth. The Blue Cheese Garlic Bread is a delicious appetizer, and the Mussel Fries are a unique and tasty dish. Don't miss their Award Winning Clam Chowder served in a sourdough bread bowl. The Fish & Chips are crispy and satisfying. Overall, the food is delicious, the service is attentive, and the atmosphere is pleasant. Highly recommended.Ambiance - 5 StarsService - 5 StarsFood - 5 Stars\", \"I took family here while we were sightseeing in San Francisco.  I was excited seeing this is one of the top reviewed restaurants in Fisherman's Wharf and was able to get last minute reservations.  We arrived early but the hostess was able to seat us which was great because the restaurant was packed already and there were groups of people waiting to get in outside.  They guided us to our table, past the gorgeous floor to ceiling windows in front of the water and saw many people with full unobstructed views.  We were so disappointed to find out that they had a separate back room cramped with many small tables and situated in such a way that only half the guests had views of the window.  It doesn't seem fair however they decide which parties get to sit in the main dining room vs the back room.  The food was OK, the clam chowder is supposedly award winning but it was very average to me.  I had the mussel fries which needed much more broth and garlic aioli on top of the fries.  I guess if I ever came back I would make sure to call ahead and get a table in front of the windows so everyone can enjoy.\", \"I highly recommend the Fog Harbor Fish House.  This restaurant is located at pier 39, which may cause to concern that it's a tourist trap, and while Fog Harbor certainly is popular, this is a legitimate and amazing place to eat.  The views of San Francisco Bay are sweeping and there is not a seat in the house that does not offer beautiful views.  The restaurant layout is spacious but cozy and warm, and the wait staff and service are spectacular and make you feel welcome and appreciated.  One last thing - the food!  Wow the food is a delicious tour of the city's favorite seafood fare.\", \"We decided to have lunch at Fog Harbor Fish House. Upon arrival, we were seated within just 5 minutes. The restaurant's ambiance was delightful, even though it was crowded. Our server, Nick, was both friendly and helpful, guiding us in making our meal choices. We went with his recommendations and ordered the crab cakes, clam chowder, salmon, and shellfish platter. The food was great and worth the hype.\", 'When I see claims of \"the best\" or  \"world famous\", I can\\'t help but try out the thing to see if it is indeed, the best. Fog Harbor Fish House has been awarded the Best Seafood Restaurant in San Francisco and has award-winning Clam chowder. Being the best in San Fran is a bold claim, so I made it a point to stop here while exploring Pier 39. In case you\\'re ever looking for this place, know that it is on the second floor, so you need to go upstairs to get the front door. I made a reservation through Yelp a couple days in advance for a table for 1 for lunch. My reservation was honored and I was seated right away. The view from my table by the window was great; it overlooked the pier and I had a good time watching sea lions play and swim as further out tour ships arrived and left. On to the food. I ordered just one thing - a cup of clam chowder. There is an option to add crab meat, but I decided against it (hint: add the crab for a tastier soup). With no modifications, the clam chowder was pretty tasty. It was hot and I enjoyed eating it alongside the complementary bread and butter. Would it win my award for best chowder... the verdict is still out because it\\'s the first clam chowder I\\'ve ever had haha. I can say I would like more clam in the soup and that adding crab would have made a big difference. Seeing as I could have had another bowl... or two, I can concede that it\\'s a darn good clam chowder. If I hadn\\'t had a plane to catch, I would also try the Crab Cakes and the Seared Scallop & Crab Risotto. Next time!', \"Their killer clam chowder - seriously heavy and packed with flavor that sticks with you - is where it's at. Their garlic fries is also a must try, makes you lingering for more. The linguine pasta is okay and does not steal the spotlight like the chowder. The place itself vibes as it's in a touristy area, adding to the whole experience. If you're all about that hearty, soul-warming clam chowder in a cozy setting, this is a solid choice.\", \"This was genuinely one of the best meals I've ever had. I will definitely be back again whenever I'm in San Francisco again!Food:-Clam chowder: This was so good. It was nice and thick with a lot of clams. The seasoning was perfect and the mini sourdough roll was also delicious and paired perfectly with the clam chowder.-Scallop and crab risotto: I love risotto, and this was maybe the best risotto I've had. It looked pretty small from the photos, but it was actually a normal meal size portion. I ended up not being able to finish it all after eating the clam chowder too. The scallops were tender and seared well, and I was happy they weren't over cooked at all. The risotto was nice and buttery with a nice crab flavor. My favorite part of this dish was definitely the scallops. It was a bit on the salty side, but everything else about this dish was so good I still will give it a 5/5.Service and setting: The wait staff was so friendly and quick. I didn't have to wait too long for my food. The view was beautiful, especially the large windows the overlook the bay. You can see the sea lions and Alcatraz out the window.\", 'We love Fog Harbor Fish House. Each time we have been there, we enjoy every aspect of it. This last time our waiter Sean or Shawn was extra exceptional. He helped us with our food selection and all his suggestions were right now. We both enjoyed our dishes. And we received a birthday surprise.We will be back for sure.(Oops I started this review like 3 weeks ago and never finished, sorry!)', \"So let's presume that you are out on a pier in San Francisco and you want some of the best seafood you've ever had.  Everybody in my family was satisfied and pleased with what they got and boy boy did we order everything from baked fish, to fish and chips, to delicious sourdough bread sides\", \"The food was very good.  There was four of us so we had a variety of food and it was all enjoyed. We began with clam chowder, one cup with crab (at extra cost) and one without.  Each was excellent. Two of us had crab ravioli. It was delicious.  Minimal sauce was left on either of the plates, it was that good. Another of us had the Petrale Sole.  It was plated beautifully.  The sole is served with just enough spinach, potatoes, and a pesto caper sauce.  My friend said it was quite tasty.I had the Pesto Chicken Pasta.  This was very rich in pesto and yet didn't have an over appealing taste.  It, too, came with spinach.  Also tomatoes, peppers and onions, but something was missing to make it flavorful.My friend had some wine that was listed at one price, but then charged a few dollars more. We verified before leaving the menu to see why we may have been mistaken in the price. It turned out the smaller glass was the cost we thought.   I think the waiter should have clarified with my friend as to what size glass she may have wanted.  It's all good, she enjoyed her wine.  The restaurant was very nice, quite busy and we had a beautiful harbor view.  Service was prompt.\", 'Food was delicious! Everything we tried was so fresh and delicious. Our server Shawn was great, he recommended adding shrimp to the risotto and that was delicious. Also super attentive, nice and helpful. View in the restaurant is beautiful right over the water and it was busy but we felt relaxed and not rushed at all. Great environment inside. Totally recommend for a nice or casual dinner!', 'Food was just Zoe.  Not bad not great.  Recommended to try with open mind Staff not real attentive', 'Pier Side Bites At first glance I thought this would be a little \"chainy\" but I was mistaken.  We were deciding on a meal or tasting several apps to split.  Our waiter Bongjovi was attentive and prompt in checking on us.  We chose the Mussel fries, Clam Chowder, Baked Bruschetta and the Ahi Poke Stack.  All three delish and when/if we are back in SF, I want to try the Fish & Chips. Clam chowder was super creamy, not fishy and full of ingredients. Mussel fries were a neat take on the classic French fry but mussels in a cream sauce. Baked Bruschetta was my favorite. The balsamic drizzle mixed with the baked bread was perfect.  Never had it baked before and it really enhances the dish.  Ahi Poke was also very nice.  We could have used a few more wonton chips (we didn\\'t ask so that\\'s my fault). The avocado on the bottom, the diced mango and the ahi tuna topper was perfection. Overall, delicious place to spend on the water if you are wanting the fresh seafood dishes.', \"The 5 of us got here around 5:30pm and didn't have to wait for a table. They started us with warm complimentary sourdough rolls with butter which were good.- Clam chowder bread bowl: the soup was really good (I detest it when places make it more 'high end' which usually means bland), but I echo the reviews that suggest getting a bowl rather than a bread bowl so that you get more soup.- Seafood penne: This was my favorite out of the dishes. A flavorful tomato sauce with pasta that wasn't overcooked with lots of seafood.- Shellfish platter for 2: This has a garlic butter taste over the seafood which was nice, as the linguine on the bottom soaked up a lot of the sauce.- Whole Dungeness crab: Got this for my dad and he really liked it. I appreciated the steamed green beans and peppers.It was my dad's birthday and they gave us a complimentary 'Brookie' dessert which had a nice ice cream.\", \"The food was not all that. I had crab cakes . The middle was mushy. The sauce it sat in was not flavorful at all. The mangos on the salad looked mushy. Like things weren't fresh. The garlic cheese bread was just cheese. No garlic at all. It was so uneventful. I was really sad . I wanted to enjoy this. The people were nice , the restaurant was beautiful. The restroom was clean and smelled good. I ended up leaving hungry . Now im going to my concert looking for food!\", \"Went in for an anniversary date and it was the perfect place! We were seated near the window and watch the sunset over Alcatraz from our table. The perfect backdrop to our perfect dinner. Bongjovi was our server and he was fabulous. He was very attentive and checked on us often. He even suggested I get the strawberry lemonade over the strawberry basil nojito because I was a bit iffy on the amount of basil. The drink was great. I also let him surprise me with my dinner choice because his energy was so high. He was very friendly and made our visit so much better. Now for the food... it was great! We started with a bowl of clam chowder. This is hands down the best clam chowder in San Francisco. Don't leave without trying it! We also had the caesar salad which was made with whole romaine and dressed perfectly. For our meals we had the crab topped new york steak and the cioppino (chosen by Bongjovi!). Both meals were great. The cioppino had lots of seafood in it and the broth was good. I would absolutely recommend eating here for a celebration or even a casual bite while you're on the wharf.\", \"A friend recommended this place to me. The host was kind and sat my friend and I immediately. We told the host we were only there for an appetizer and a spot at the bar would be fine. They sat us at a table in the restaurant though.We told the waitress we were really excited to try the blue cheese garlic bread. That is what a friend recommended to us! The waitress wrote it down and asked if we wanted anything else, we said no and she made a scoffing noise (like she was mad we only wanted the bread). My friend felt pressured to order something else so she got a glass of wine. My friend said the wine was alright.... she regretted getting it.The bread finally came and we both tried it! You can definitely taste the cheese first and the garlic later on. Personally not my fave but my friend loved it and ate it right up! The waitress came by and dropped off the check (not asking if we wanted anything else or how the bread and wine were). My friend and I were engaged in conversation and so we didn't take out our credit cards immediately. The waitress came by 5 times all withing minutes of each other. We felt very pressured to get out. My friend wasn't even done with her wine..... She gave the waitress her card and then quickly finished the wine. We couldn't get out of there fast enough.Overall the food was good, the wine was ok, the service was pushy....\", 'Delicious clam chowder. Amazing views, and had a very kind server named Daniela who made the experience even better. View of farris wheel as well as Alcatraz. Reasonable pricing as well. Great experience on this mother daughter trip to pier 39 at Fog house fish house.', 'All the food was delicious and the place was cozy and felt like I was in Italy. And the serving people were friendlyServing time is kind', \"This place was truly a gem not only did me and my date  have an amazing time our server was extremely polite the prices weren't crazy and now I wanna come back and get the garlic crab I love this place we wanted a bigger seat and the server had no problem accommodating Wish I woulda took a pic of the food but I told my date I wouldn't pick my phone up lol Thank yall for helping me secure not only a queen but a great person I appreciate it fasho\", \"Stopped by here for a late lunch/early dinner before seeing Greg Alan over at the Masonic. Our waiter was Luis and he was incredibly attentive. He checked in on us frequently and even offered to take our picture when our food came out. My partner and I ordered crab cakes, half order of oysters, and two clam chowder bowls. It came out to about $82. I'll talk about each item in the order of how I would rank them:1) The crab cakes took the award this round. It was a decent size, crispy on the outside, and and perfectly falls apart on the inside. Great crab flavors too. The sauce paired with it was fantastic. I could have licked the plate clean if it wasn't frowned upon by society. It also comes with a small mango(?) salad on the plate.2) The oysters were very tiny. I realize the fancier the place, the smaller the oysters. Merp. However, it tasted fresh and clean (if you know, you know) and wasn't gritty.3) The clam chowder was HOT, just the way I like my soup. Great flavor, good quantity of clams; however, as I write about this 2 days later, that's all I remember of it. Would I order it again? Sure. Perhaps not in a sourdough bowl though.I'd visit this place again if it were a special occasion. But for some regular chowder, I might go elsewhere.\", \"Indulging in the finest lobster roll of my life was an absolute delight! The lobster roll's quality here is the best I've ever had. Served with a generous side of melted butter, and the option to order more, it's truly the epitome of this dish. The clam chowder was delightful, but the star is undoubtedly the lobster roll. The stellar staff, including the hostess, waitress, and bartender, made the experience even more memorable with their exceptional kindness and assistance. This restaurant has the best quality staff and food by far out of all of Pier 39! Should I find myself at Pier 39 again, there's no doubt this is the only place I'd choose to eat at. The bustling crowd during my visit speaks volumes - undoubtedly the best restaurant on Pier 39! :)\", \"If you want some delicious seafood and an awesome view of the bay .... This is your stop. Busy busy busy restaurant; but service is still really good and food comes out faster than expected.  We ordered the clam chowder; boy was it tasty and hearty. Felt like I was back on the east coast. Very hot temperature wise; which I loved and good. Good mixture of clams, bacon, veggies and chowda.  The calamari is bomb; even includes fried onions and jalapeños.... Cooked to perfection; and light and tasty.  Ordered the lobster roll; omg one of the best lobster rolls I've ever had. The brioche bun being toasted and the hot side of butter added the icing to the top. The lobster was tender, meaty and there was a good amount of it. My taste buds were in seafood heaven.  I felt like I was in another level after eating here. So freaking good!\", 'For the price we were really expecting a better experience.  The service is really terrible and the food is meh.  We were sat and ignored for at least 10 minutes. Our waiter showed up and simply asked \"are you ready to order\". We got a cup of clam chowder to start which came with rolls. The rolls were great but the chowder was very thick and very bland. The food was delivered in a timely manner but we could not get our waiter back to the table to get another drink.  Both salad and salmon were \"just ok\". The view was pretty and if you go at sunset even better.  It\\'s our silver lining for the dinner fail.', \"Waterfront side during a Blue Angels show = perfect day! 5 of us walked up to the hostess, and we told her we wanted outdoor seating. Wait time was only 2 mins... Seems people were not used to 85-degree weather in San Fran lol. So we sat down, and the waiter took a bit before coming w menus. The food was great - I tried their famous clam chowder, fried calamari, oysters, and lobster roll. It was very fresh and flavorful. The Spritz blackberry drink was delicious.. I ordered 3! Overall, it's a great restaurant for people watching and enjoying the good weather while eating superb food!\", 'Food was delicious!! The garlic butter crab was the best I have had in a long time!!The waitress was quick and friendly. Got our food hot!', \"I wish I had more of an appetite when I visited here. There were so many options on the menu that I wanted to try. I had room for a cup of clam chowder, though! I asked for a side of bread vs. getting a bread bowl, and my server was happy to accommodate anything I wanted--amazing! So was the clam chowder. The Caesar salad was just ok to me, though.My server recommended the Blood Orange Margarita. I'd never had one that included egg whites, but the foam was a nice touch!I'm currently trying to figure out a way to return before I head back home. This is a great restaurant and good representation of the foodie scene here in SF.\", \"I've been lucky enough to go to San Francisco twice this year and this restaurant was amazing the first time we went. Yes, it's that good. The view, service and food were incredible. The crab risotto [first visit] was perfect. This time, I also had crab ravioli, which was perfect. They ruined my crabs everywhere else. My friend Natasha also enjoyed their dishes. Of course, the chowder in a sourdough bread bowl is a must.

      "Reviews: ['This place has very good alfredo here and the customers they gave me was awesome, I will def give them a try if your out in the bay area. My wife thought I was exaggerating until I had to ring her ha', \"Came here on a Saturday night without a reservation. We waited for 40 minutes before we were seated. I'm normally not a huge fan of Italian but this is one of my favorite Italian spots in the bay.Not so - it was refreshing and the grapefruit really toned down the sweetness.Dungeness Crab Arancini - crispy on the outside. I loved how it was topped with pickled pepper radish and coated with scallion aioli. It was so good.Handkerchief - I'm always a fan of Bolognese so when I saw this white Bolognese, I knew I had to order it. It was so creamy but still felt light because the pasta was paper thin. I also loved how the pasta came out piping hot.Bucatini - the pistachio pesto got me to order this. The tomato based sauce was so light and tangy. The cheese on top added a little bit of creaminess. The pistachio pesto worked surprisingly well with the tomato sauce.\", \"Leaving a four star review because I think Yelpbiased higher scores but let's be clear this place was average, especially for food.Just being upfront the food was overpriced and over salted. It's not that it was bad per se, but not worth what Pearl is charging. Nothing was bad but nothing was memorable at all.If you're coming here, stick around for the service and pleasant atmosphere. Those were highlights.\", 'Want to have a great meal in a lovely place?  Try Pearl.   Being a single patron, I sat at the bar although I was given a choice to sit outside.  Both options seemed quite good.  And the staff was tip-top.Roasted cauliflower with sliced almonds, raisins and a black tahini hummus sauce was a great way to begin my meal.  The plate was well composed and the spicing was nuanced and subtle.Next up, seared scallops with spaetzle, corn and braised onions was a wonderful main course.  The crisp exterior of each large scallop encased an interior that was not overcooked.  And the sweet corn enlivened the entire plate.In and out and home to walk the dog while it was light.   And parking on Sunday evening was easy.', \"Pearl is my favorite restaurant in SF!I've tried a decent amount of their menu and everything is delicious! Starter, mains, dessert, drinks, everything!!! I try to stop by every few months to try their seasonal dishes.I had a work dinner here a few months back and my out of town colleagues all loved their meal here! Interior is very cute and service has always been great. They don't take reservations over 6 people so probably not the best for large groups, unless you're ok with splitting up the group into smaller tables.I love their cauliflower! I order it every time. For mains, all of their pastas are fantastic and I've loved every scallop seasonal dish I've had. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. My favorite cocktail is the tidy tips. Can't wait until my next visit!\", \"One of my favorite restaurants in the city! I love that it's hidden in the Richmond. I've come twice now and both times, the food was amazing and service was exceptional.I love trying their pastas, but everything is delicious. You can't go wrong with any of it.\", \"This is only my second time here, but it's become one of my favorite restaurants. I don't eat too much salad, but Pearl's Caesar is the exception. Their Caesar has a strong taste of anchovies, creating the perfect umami. If you're not a fan of anchovies, this salad may not sit will with you lol. It's lemony, cheesy, and the crispy prosciutto and croutons elevate the salad really well. I could eat this by myself if I tried, but of course I shared it with my boyfriend lol.Their steak tartare is the standard for me - whenever I order it elsewhere, it never compare to Pearl's. Beefy, lemony, and full of flavor. The texture pairs very well with the crisps they provide.The bavette steak was really good according to my boyfriend. He barely shared any with me and devoured it lol. I would love to order this next time if its on the menu.A few gripes..The Gemelli - first bite was delicious, full of flavor. I loved the spice and combination of the capers and sun dried tomatoes. The tuna was cooked well. The thing is - the more I ate, I soon came to realize how salty the dish was. I love salt and all things savory, but it became difficult to eat. I love olives, but their olives made the pasta even saltier considering the capers and spice. They really need to lighten their hand when seasoning this dish lol. I would have returned the dish had I not waited so long for it. This brings me to my next point..The wait - It was busy. I will not deny that. We were lucky enough to snag a reservation. Our Rez was at 730, and we came right on time and was seated immediately. We ordered maybe within the next 5 minutes. Our apps came out pretty fast, and I'd say we were done eating them by 810? The thing is, our entrees didn't come out until 840. Every single table around us had gotten their food before us, despite having came after us. The table to our left only ordered entrees - ok, that I understand. But the table seated directly behind us came a good 20 minutes after us, and also ordered apps, yet their entrees were also delivered before ours. The table to our right had completely finished eating before we even got our entrees. It was disappointing, as the service was subpar. I understand it's busy, but the waitress (Katie I believe) didn't pay us any mind and we had to flag her down to receive updates regarding our order. I'm willing to wait, so long as it doesn't feel like our order was forgotten lol. It felt like that. The waitress didn't seemed concerned that we were waiting that long. I honestly think she forgot to put our entrees in? Either that, or they need to work on their timing with the delivery of apps and entrees. I will surely be returning and will be supporting this business, but would recommended avoiding the dinner rush as much as possible. I'm sure it's much better when they open right at 5. Overall, this restaurant deserves their flowers despite the underwhelming service.\", \"Ambiance: I booked an inside table for 8pm on a Sunday. It was charming and lively. Very nice for a date night. Service: Attentive and nice!Oysters: 4/5Solid - texture was smooth and the toppings complimented the oyster. Acme bread and butter: 4/5Solid, but nothing special - what I'd expect from complimentary bread and butter from the table, except this time it was a $4 chargeChicory Caesar: 5/5Amazing! I love the texture and taste of the crispy prosciutto with crisp mixed lettuce. The croutons were also great. Everything worked well together. Handkerchief: 4/5Solid pasta, and best pasta of the night. I haven't had a white bolognese before. It was light and easy to eat. If I were to make this at home, I would add maybe a touch of truffle oil to add more to the dish. Bucatini: 4/5Loved the stracciatellla with the pesto and basil. I thought the dish was okay at first, but it grew on me with each bite that I took. Buttermilk Panna Cotta: 5/5Silky panna cotta, absolutely lovely with the strawberries and the chocolate sable. Olive Oil Cake: 5/5This was my favorite out of the two desserts I tried. The texture of the cake was everything and more. The ice cream worked well with the cake too. If you were to choose between the cake and the panna cotta, choose the cake!Overall, solid food. I wouldn't go back for the pasta, but definitely for the desserts and caesar salad!\", \"Food:The cauliflower was what I ordered and it was surprisingly delicious. The raisins balanced out the savory aspects and really made the dish stand out. Service:Perfect, we saw that everyone was very warm and friendly and attentive.Ambiance: It's lively but also romantic. This is good for friends or for a date.\", 'It was soooo good! Food is amazing! Definitely must visit place for amazing experience.', \"The food at Pearl is delicious!  I've been twice and ordered different apps, mains and dessert, and both times I was delighted with each bite.  The staff are friendly and attentive, making customers feel at home.  The cocktail list is inventive and the bar tenders execute them well.\", \"I took my husband to Pearl for his dinner and we had a wonderful time. The atmosphere was very welcoming, it was cozy, and we felt like we could relax. Our waitress was nice and gave us helpful recommendations. We ended up having the Kanpachi Crudo, the Hankerchief Pasta, and the Seared Scallops. All were very tasty and I would have again. My only slight disappointment was that I put that it was his birthday on the reservation, when I was texting to confirm the reservation, and the waitress when we sat down. Despite all of this, they didn't bring a candle with the chocolate cake we ordered. I know this is small, but it's a nice thing that restaurants do and it doesn't cost much - I was a little sad that it made it slightly less birthday festive.\", \"First time back in over 4 years. Was surprised that the menu hasn't changed too much. Overall, still a solid meal especially the tartare and pastas.Halibut crudo: Fish was refreshing, but thought the peanuts and jalapeño overpowered some of the more subtle flavors.Chicory Caesar: enjoyed the garlic croutons and certainly a more hearty salad.Roasted cauliflower: Really enjoyed the charred smoky flavors and the black tahini hummus.Steak tartare: one of my favorite dishes of the night. Super savory without feeling too heavy.Mt. Lassen Trout: Fish had nice flavors, but was a bit over cooked IMO.Handkerchief: One of their signature dishes. Pasta had a great al dente texture. Would order again.Gemelli: Nice bounce to the pasta and enjoyed the freshness of the peas.Cocktails: Prices were pretty good for SF standards ($14)Birds Eye: Essentially an old fashioned. Wasn't necessarily too creativeCoastal scrub: Refreshing and citrus profile.\", \"One of my favorite Mediterranean/Italian spots in SF, with consistently great service delicious plates, and creative cocktails. The menu changes with the regularly with only the freshest ingredients. I have yet to be disappointed.The space is causal, warm, cozy, spacious, and romantic all at once, along with a beautiful bar.They have an outdoor option, equipped with heating lamps.Plates this visit:-Wood oven gulf prawns - Fresh Gulf shrimp wood oven roasted to perfection in Diabla and served with Zhuhai crème fraiche.-Roasted cauliflower - Love the different textures and flavors in this dish, the smokiness of the cauliflower, smoothness of the of the black tahini hummus, and the crunch of the almonds-Seared scallops - So fresh and perfectly seared served with delicious butter beans, spinach ragout, maitake mushrooms and caper relish.-Spaghetti - Tossed with fresh Manila clams and delicious nasturtium, watercress and fermented Chile.-Radiatori  - Prepared al dente in a delicious lamb merguez sugo, finished with fresh sheep feta and lemon oil.Thank you Chef and and service team.See y'all next time.\", \"Everything is delicious! They can easily accommodate gluten free and it was just such an incredible meal. The staff is so friendly, the cocktails are absolutely phenomenal, and the actual restaurant space is just so beautiful and inviting. Definitely make a reservation, or plan on waiting for awhile, as it's a fairly small space and definitely popular.\", 'My rating is a solid 4.5/5. The service was impeccable. I came with two toddlers and was seated immediately on a Friday afternoon. Our waitress was named Alice and she had great communication, was kind to my girls, and offered to get their food in first which helped immensely! I order the scallops and Brussel sprouts . The Brussel sprouts came out first and highly recommend! However the scallops took a very long time to come out and seared nicely however some were not cooked properly. And for that minus .5 stars. I will definitely be returning to try their cocktails, dessert and more menu items.', \"Pearl 6101 sits on a quiet street, but the restaurant and bar are bustling and busy.

Drinks: Pearl Cocktail (5/5)My sister and I came in and had the pearl cocktail which was recommended to us by the waiter. It's a must try! Food:Appetizer- Chicory Caesar (5/5) An upscale Caesar salad defined by a medley of flavors and textures!! It was shared amongst two people and was a great appetizer to have. Pasta- Handkerchief (5/5)A must when going to Pearl. I was at a loss of words when eating this pasta. The plate was completely clean when we had finished eating.\", 'Came here for my birthday and will be going back. The overall decor and ambiance makes you feel transported to a quaint French bistro. We all got different dishes and we all wanted to lick our plates after. The favorite of the night were the scallops. Our server was pleasant and helped us pick a bottle of wine after our cocktails.', \"Came here twice for dinner. Enjoyed it both times! Got the steak and handkerchief pasta this time. The steak dish had so many flavors - good combination. It could have been a little more tender on the outside but overall very good medium rare. The pasta was good as well (!), just not as unique. Finished off with panna cotta which was super light and tasty! Only thing is that it is quite echo-y inside so it's hard to hear what each other are saying. Outside might be better for conversation, might try tha next time.food - 5/5service - 4/5ambiance - 3.5/5 (very loud inside, though cute interior)value - 4/5 (good price for the quality and uniqueness of dishes)\", 'They have excellent food options and the food was well-cooked, nice portion.

I had a nice experience there.', 'I came here last week after Config and I got the handkerchief pasta and it so good. The \"noodles\" were large rectangular pieces and it had grounded up meat with thin slices of Parmesan. I\\'ve never had pasta like this before but it was so savory and rich. Highly recommend.', \"Fantastic for dinner! We came here for my friend's birthday dinner, having made a reservation well in advance (100% necessary). We ended up getting caught in traffic on the way up, but we called and the restaurant was able to accommodate our lateness. Once we arrived, we were seated at a large table near the back. The space was relatively small but in a cozy and classic way - pretty casual vibes. Our server Jake came over right away and we started off with some drinks - I got an Aperol Spritz (too heavy on the Aperol/light on the Prosecco, but I still enjoyed it) and my friends got the Tidy Tips (very tasty) and Birds Eye (didn't try this one). We also got some starters to share - the Acme Bread & Butter, Chicken Liver Mousse (fantastic), Gulf Prawns (great seasoning but not a whole lot of prawn to eat), Oysters (phenomenal, so fresh), and Roasted Cauliflower (also great, totally exceeded my expectations). After this, it was time for pasta! I don't know why they don't advertise it anywhere, but Pearl can sub gluten free pasta into any of their pasta dishes. However, it's not even on their menu so I only knew this from the Yelp reviews. I got the gluten free Radiatori and my friends got the Spinach-Ricotta Gnudi, Spaghetti, and Seared Scallops. All the entrees were phenomenal, and I absolutely loved my pasta dish. Portion sizes were also perfect - I finished the entire dish and didn't feel overly full afterwards. We also got Espresso Martinis to finish off the meal, which were pretty good but had a bit too much foam. Overall though, I would LOVE to return!\", 'I went with my friends to \"Pear Restaurant\", and from the beginning to the end the servers were friendly. It was full when we got there and kindly we were asked to wait for a table, while waiting we sat in the front patio next to nice tall heaters. Food, drinks, and desserts were top the shelf no only have a nice presentation but are full of flavor. Great restaurant in a nice corner of San Francisco.', \"Best date spot since it's cozy with so much warmth and low lighting. Definitely will be coming back again.Service 5/5 our server came around multiple times to make sure we were enjoying our meal and to make sure our glasses were always filled. She was really kind too! Squid ink bucatini 5/5Hands down the best thing we had. The Calabrian gives it the perfect kick and the tuna was perfect for the flavors of the noodles.Prawns 5/5Second best dish since it has a lime flavor with a chili kick to it too. I think they may have used bird eye chilis. Oysters 5/5Pork chop 2/5Very underwhelming compared to everything else and didn't really have a flavor but more of just straight up meat alone. Steak 3/5Wouldn't get again but the medium rare steak was good. They were precut into five thick slices and dint have too much flavor to it too.CauliflowerWe had broccoli instead I think but it was the same toppings. Despite it being broccoli, it tasted good still\", \"My husband saw that they had a white Bolognese on the menu and immediately decided he wanted to dine here to celebrate his 40th birthday.  The atmosphere is pretty hip but also very chill.  They have some other nice food offerings too, and a particularly tasty wine menu.  It's in a quiet neighborhood and perhaps off your path but worth the drive over.  Oh, and I highly recommend reservations since the space is pretty small.\", \"The cutest little restaurant for a cozy hangout or date night! While there is indoor and outdoor seating, I'd recommend getting a reservation beforehand since it gets quite busy and parking can be hard to come by.The menu changes by seasons so some items may be switched around depending on when you go-- but I highly recommend any of the pastas.For drinks, we ordered the morning glory: 4/5 --sweet, fruity, refreshing!handkerchief pasta: 5/5 -- creamy, hearty pasta with plenty of cheese. The flavor profile was very balanced, not too salty or sickeningly heavyclam spaghetti: 5/5 -- my absolute favorite pasta dish!!! The sauce was heavenly; a bit of umami from the clams, sweetness from wine and butter, this pasta was truly the star of the show. I had to stop myself from ordering another one! Overall, I really like the ambiance of this restaurant and would recommend to anyone in the area who is looking for a cute, homey dining experience\", 'Came here for dinner on a Sunday and it was still pretty packed! Our server was super sweet and recommended a couple of their favorites. We ended up getting the steak tartare, the roasted cauliflower, and the sticky chocolate torte. The sauce that the cauliflower sits on was so good, it was super rich and nutty with a slight chili oil flavor. The steak tartare was also pretty good! I would def come here for small groups cause all their dishes are great for sharing!', \"An excellent meal with complex well-composed dishes that showed both solid execution and innovation.The cauliflower app is a must. So much going on there with the mole, almost, and sweet raisins. It's just a new set of flavors and textures to explore.The popular handkerchief pasta didn't disappoint. The pasta was perfectly fresh and chewy. The sauce was a nice balance of lightness and body.The torte I thought was just OK. It didn't have that intensity of flavor that was achieved in the savory dishes I had.\", 'Delicious! We started with oysters (perfect size) and a delicious house made hot sauce. We also got the Brandade fritters, came with 2 in the order. Yummy but small.For our main courses we got Handkerchief and the Pork Schnitzel, both delicious and bigger portions compared to other entrees.', \"This is my third dining at the Pearl 6101 restaurant (prior I came with friends).  Today we celebrated our daughter's advance birthday that I made the reservation almost 4 weeks in advance with indoor seating.  The restaurant got pretty busy.  When we sat down the music was loud but later I noticed it got adjusted.  We ordered the delicious French red wine 2018 Domaine Maestracci. We had snacks Brandade Fritters and the fresh & warm Acme bread with butter.  Actually our daughters ordered second of the bread as it was good.  For starter we ordered the roasted cauliflowers with hummus topped with roasted almonds that made it tasty.  We ordered our own main entrees like Handkerchief and Bucatini pastas, Sea Bass, Seared Scallops and Pork Chops.  Our dessert Buttermilk Panna Cotta came in with a birthday candle. We also had the Chocolate Pudding as dessert. Everyone agreed we had a scrumptious birthday dinner.  In the beginning the server (Alicia?) was waiting patiently as we were not decided what to drink and what to order.  I hope they fix where the outside sign is as the paint is peeling off on ceiling and post!  Anyhow there is no doubt in my mind that we shall return in the future!\", \"What a little gem!  An easygoing spot with a comfortable atmosphere.  Everyone was friendly, and food + service were great.  It's got lots of light and  a diverse yet concise menu -- everyone can find something that works here.  Roasted Cauliflower steak was a hit for all of us.  I ordered the scallops, which were a solid (though not life-changing) choice.  The next time I'm back, I'll get a pasta (we shared one and it was excellent)Came here for a business discussion and the ambiance/noise level works great for that purpose.\", \"Loved the hustle and bustle of this joint, and the food was a pleasant nostalgic mix of homestyle and modern dining. Layout kinda made me think about being in one of my friend's grandma's house from the south.Ordered the oysters cuz they prepare them with a cute little red dot. I'm usually a purist, but these were fun. However, please be careful when you slurp. The spicy tang from the sauce may induce wheezing.Also got the wood fired prawns plated on top of a beautiful green sauce and cauliflower drizzled in some kind of pesto crumble. Both were fun but neither were amazing. For example, the prawns were charred to perfection but were the same kind you can buy from any higher end market in SF. I've never found real fresh shrimp/prawns in SF, so if you find them please let me know where and thanks!Drinks were fun. I got a glass of wine which I was disappointed with, and my partner appreciated them making her a mezcal margarita off menu.Only real complaint was slow service. I couldn't blame the servers, who were great. The restaurant was just understaffed.All in all good times. I might come back like every other year.\", \"Remarkable Service! Great ambiance and remarkable food! We ordered the Chicken Liver Mousse toast, an excellent appetizer!  Perfection! Then we had the Fried Brussel Sprouts. An excellent and interesting combination with roasted grapes and walnut purée. Of course we ordered the Acme bread...which was different from other restaurants' Acme bread...this one was curated for Pearl. We had the Handkerchief Pasta with white Bolognese Sauce...unique and luscious. Lastly we wanted the Seared Scallops but it was not available that night but instead was offered the Roast Pork Belly which turned out to be a great choice. It could have been a five star restaurant if it had a wider choice for the customers to choose. May consider coming back...\", 'This restaurant is my go to place to eat with friends and family. I love the outdoor area, it is so European.The menu is easy to navigate. the food is fresh and yummy.Will keep coming to Pearl.', 'One of my favorite hidden gems in SF!

Note: the max number of people they will seat is 4 ppl. Would highly recommend!', 'It on our rotation.  Very pleasant and relaxed outside.  Space heaters were working.  The food is always good.  The crudo, which changes seasonally, is a must.', 'Thursday night and the restaurant was bustling.  Reasonably priced for SF and a good selection of choices. Food was delicious but chefs may have a heavier hand of salt than usual. However, the staff could use a bit of training:1. Cocktail was forgotten until I asked someone (not my own server) to follow up and the response was : I don\\'t know what you ordered! Hmm, couldn\\'t he check it with the system? Cocktail finally arrived in the middle of main course2. I was very insistent on no chilli, not even on the side, for the appetizer, but apparently one of the mains has \"tons\" of chilli and it wasn\\'t even listed on the menu! Why didn\\'t the server say anything? We couldn\\'t eat it at all3. When we left, you have to pass by the front desk, even though she saw us coming, there was no \"goodbye\" \"thank you\" nothing! Will I go back? Probably not. There are so many restaurants in sf, I don\\'t think I need to make a trip out here for subpar service.', 'This meal did not miss. Went here on a Friday with friends and scored a 5:30pm indoor reservation day of, luckily. The inside is very cute and airy, sort of like a European cafe. Service was lovely and prompt as well. We decided to do family style and loved it. To start, we got the acme bread - warm soft with a lovely crust, oysters - fresh with unique and delightful flavors on top, and tartare - a generous portion with excellent contrasting flavor from the pickled onions and frisée. To share for the mains, we got the sole, steak, spaghetti, and handkerchief pasta. Everything was perfect. I really liked how the seafood spaghetti had a good flavor and nice coating of sauce, usually I find that seafood pasta has a more watery sauce that doesn\\'t stick as well, but this one was great! The handkerchief pasta was delicious and rich, some of my friends mentioned it reminded them (nostalgically) of \"the best hamburger helper\" and were raving about how homey it tasted. I thought it was delicious too. The fish was delicious and well-cooked and the steak had a wonderful almost molé-like sauce that my friends also loved. As for drinks, we had cocktails and wine. I enjoyed all of the cocktails I was able to try (3 of them). All around, a solid spot with not a single thing on the menu I didn\\'t like.', \"Came here with some friends and it lived up to the hype. I highly recommend making a reservation because it is very popular. There is eating inside and outside of the restaurant. My friends and I shared pastas and the caesar salad. The caesar salad is probably the best I've ever had. Can't wait to take others here! Beautiful decor and ambiance.\", 'The pasta had an amazing sauce. The scallops were seared to a lovely crisp.

Loaded with mushrooms. The huge variety of fillings in the taxi gave it such an amazing flavor. It is sorta spicy in itself, but if you're a spice lover, ask them for their spicy sauce on the side. It makes it even better. I'd definitely rate this dish 5/5. The only downer for me was that there were only two tacos for $14, and that seemed a tad pricy despite the inflation, the location in SF, and the quality of the food. I wish there was one more taco. Maybe it's the right price and I probably didn't get the right feel of the ambiance since I came in at 11:30 AM by myself. The restaurant was fairly empty and there were less than 5 people. The lady who took my order was very friendly! I was confused if I should get another plate of tacos (sweet potato) but I didn't want to spend over $30 for a brunch meal by myself. I will definitely be back once again after another soccer game, because I want to try some of their other dishes. I rate the place 4.5/5, but I couldn't round off to 5 because of the portions for a $20 meal with tip. :(\", \"A little loud, but the food is delicious.

Recommend this one! Concha's borrachas: DO NOT RECOMMEND. Had a very fishy sus taste. We only ate a couple bites and just didn't trust it. The chorizo didn't have flavor.

It\\'s good for what it is, this isn\\'t your homestyle/street food type mexican food. This is your \"fancy resort in mexico type\" and for that, it is good. Especially paired with their well made cocktails, thats a win. In terms of food, I recommend the beef tacos. Its not dry and has lots of flavors, ask for their habanero hot sauce if you wanna kick it up a notch. Their al pastor tacos were fine, it didn\\'t have the classic red char but it wasn\\'t bad. Drinks are dangerously good though, if you like mezcal, this is the place to try it. I liked my Paloma and my partner enjoyed his old fashion (i forget the actual name).', \"This place was very good! Not like mind blowingly good or anything like that, but a solid Mexican brunch place. Came here today with my sister and brother in law, and their pup Bailey. They have outdoor seating and it wasn't cold out (rarity in SF this winter) so it worked out perfectly. We got some chips and salsa, and I got the beef hash. My sister got the beef tacos and my brother in law got the pozole. The chips and salsa were great - only thing that could have made them better was warm chips but who cares. The salsa was certainly house made, very good kick, and surprisingly the salsa verde was a bit hotter than the rojo. My hash was nothing to write home about honestly but what can you expect, its potato, veggies and cut up beef. I guess the beef just wasn't that flavorful (didn't seem to have really any Mexican flavor to it - cumin, etc.), or tender. But it was still a solid dish. The eggs were perfectly poached with a nice orange yolk. I also tried the beef tacos and those were yummy, though my sister thought they were spicy. Brother in law loved his pozole. Will probably be back again because it is close by, wasn't busy and the service was good!\", \"Amazing little spot! The food is amazing. We had the frijolitos for an appetizer which was terrific. We are salsa and chips people but you have to try the frijolitos they are game changers. The beef and quesabirria tacos were both killer, but to our surprise the sweet potato tacos stole the show. This restaurant is a gem and even more so if you are vegetarian or gluten free. The marg's are no joke too. Make sure you stop here!\", 'Got a question about Otra? Ask the Yelp community!', \"Great spot for a nice, tasty dinner. Lots of veggie options. The two of us split the beans+chips, ensalada, and mushroom tacos. The beans+chipswas a little salty and the chips themselves weren't amazing. The ensalada was really really delicious and herby. The tacos were by far the star of the show! It was a spicy, umami bomb! They were pretty tiny tacos though, I don't think two tacos alone would have filled me up. We also each got a cocktail--tasty and strong. Service was just okay! Overall definitely recommend this place for a nice dinner out!\", \"Very tasty, but also very salty, especially the mussels that we got. With the chorizo, it would've been nice to have it a bit less salty. Enjoyed the two salsas that came with the totopos and salsa appetizer--both were complex and mouth warming. The mushroom tacos were full of umami and well-balanced, though on the mushy side if you care about textures. Everything tasted fresh and made with quality ingredients. The drinks were solid and positively cheap at $12 a pop. Service was great, and the vibe inside was great for a casual-ish date. Did this place stand out among the many great Mexican/taco places in the city? Not really. But I didn't try their meat tacos, so maybe that would've made the difference!\", 'Located in Lower Haight, this tapas restaurant offers a delightful dining experience. During my visit with a friend, we sampled the beef tacos, al pastor pork, and totopos with salsas. While all the dishes were enjoyable, the beef tacos stood out with their excellent sauce, tender beef, and a harmonious blend of flavors. They were so good that we ended up ordering seconds! The Al Pastor, though slightly chewier than expected, still offered a flavorful taste, especially when paired with the diverse and flavorful salsas that accompanied the chips. The margaritas were refreshing, striking a perfect balance between sourness and sweetness, and the option to share a pitcher was a welcomed feature. Overall, this is one of the top Latin spots in the area, and I highly recommend it to those in the vicinity or nearby residents.', 'Excellent foodGreat ambiance Very unique dinner that truly surprised and delighted us', \"My friend and I started off with the aguachile. If you like raw fish preparations, this is the dish for you. It was citrusy, flavorful, and VERY spicy. In our case, this was a positive but mind the spice if you're not as big of a fan. It was just the perfect thing to wake our palettes up. Also as a bonus, the portion size was bigger than I expected. For entree, we  shared the mushroom tacos and beef tacos which were a great compliment to each other. The mushroom tacos were also a bit spicy but you can ask for them without the chili flakes on top which would moderate the heat. All the dishes were super savory and delicious. The service was excellent and our waitress spent time with us walking through some dishes that would be perfect for the level of appetite we were at. I look forward to coming back with an even bigger group because the tapas format lends itself really well to sharing.\", 'Good food, service and beers.  I love the ambiance, the place is cute and really good for catching up with friends. We were hungry after getting a few drinks and my friend suggested to try it. We ordered the meatballs, aguachilles and the spicy broccoli and we loved all of them.', 'Love this place especially for vegetarian or vegans! Lots of options for us. They have mushroom, squash, and bean tacos and all of them are well curated and delicious. The drinks are delicious and unique. Everything we tried was amazing. Service was very friendly and the ambiance was casual while still being very nicely decorated. I loved it since it was perfect for all kinds of scenarios!', 'Wow! Otra is a wonderful spot for food in the Lower Haight. The decor of the restaurant is consistent and a fun mixing of textures all in shades of blue. At night it is cozy.In terms of the food, they do vegetables here very very well. The charred cabbage and roasted Brussel sprouts were flavorful. Each bite has the right balances of umami, salt, acid, and heat. The cod tostada was skillfully executed to preserve the fish (without going dry), keep a crunch on the tostada, yet round out the flavor profile.I had a margarita that evening and it had acidity that was delightful. It also was not heavy handed with the tequila and was balanced well. The service here is attentive without being pushy or overbearing. I thought they handed our party of seven well, and we never felt like there was a significant gap for plates to come out. Overall, I will be back!', \"Stopped by just for a drink & the cucumber cocktail was spot on as well as my michelada, we had already ate or else we would've ordered some food. The menu looked really good & the food smelled delicious. Will definitely be back to try the food!\", 'Great service the food was very good. Highly recommended it ! Love the tacos ! Tacos Al pastor', 'Got a question about Otra? Ask the Yelp community!', \"Hello,I took my group of friends here and we ordered some food and drinks. The Roasted Sweet Potato Tacos were excellent. The ambiance inside is really cute and a great place to take your friends to catch up if you haven't talked to them in a while. My friends suggested we try it and we loved all the food and drinks we ordered. Also the service was excellent and everything was done in a timely manner as we did not have to wait that long for anything.\", '3.5 starsWe got the Conchas Borrachas (mussels), and brussels sprouts. The mussels were tasty but the dish came with three small tortillas, we wanted a few more. The Brussels were overly seasoned, and tasted like they were marinated in pure hot sauce with not much other flavor. Service was great and the outside area allows dogs.', 'Not sure how we ended up at Otra (a suggestion from my son, I think) but we enjoyed dinner with our nephew as well who was working on a pop up for Samsung near Union Square.We shared an order of Brussels Sprouts, and they were terrific. It was a Taco night for us and we ordered Hen of the Woods Mushroom and Beef Tacos. They were excellent.Three glasses of Azul Resposado started out the dinner (my wife had the Santo Tomas Merlot, but tasted the tequila). The young men each had a Mezcal Margarita chaser.My one complaint - they actually charged me $1 for extra chips! Bush league, my friends - especially after the Azul Resposado. Lost a star on that move!', \"I saw this place while driving along Lower Haight. I decided to stop by because my curiosity is somehow telling me to try this place. So I decided to stop after work. Once I stepped into the restaurant, I didn't realize this restaurant is not your typical Mexican restaurant. It's pretty classy. I was wearing a scrubs upon going inside the restaurant. But who gives a f? I'm hungry and I wanted something to eat.I order the Beef Tacos and the Vegatables y Gigante Bean Ribolitta. I also ordered the cake for dessert and the Old Oaxacan. I don't mind the food for being pricey but servings are pretty small. The staff is wonderful and accomodating.\", 'Five stars because Haight Street needs more places like this. Four stars for food. The Frijilitos (bean dip) was the star dish. The mushroom tacos were missing something in terms of taste factor. Cute outdoor seating. Surprisingly nice stretch of Haight.', \"Food: We did family style and shared all the plates. We got the totopos and salsas first. Both of them were absolutely amazing. I'd love to take them home and add them to all my meals(note: red one is mild spicy) The totopos were perfectly crunchy, and a little on the salty side. The brussels sprouts. I don't know where to start. Probably the best ones I have had. The amount of flavor is perfect, the texture and crispiness is perfect, I loved everything about them. The sweet potato tacos were super good, very loaded, but I recommend adding some of the red and/or green salsa to them! Beef tacos were also great!Dessert: tres leches. Perfect texture, one of the best tres leches I have had. Drinks: Poco Poco (mezcal + watermelon) had a tajin rim, great drink. My friend had the Penicillin 42 (mezcal + ginger) and was super happy with it as well. Service: I added ourselves to the waitlist saying I'd be there in 20-30 minutes. When we arrived they checked us in, we waited for 3 minutes for the table.\", 'Absolutely delicious! We will definitely come back. We devoured the beef tacos, mushroom tacos, and chips/salsa. Our only complaint is portion sizes and prices.', \"We used waitlist to queue for the restaurant so we were able to get in as soon as we arrived. The place is quite nicely decorated, although the music and the whole place was too loud for me so I can't really enjoy being there.The vegan options are plenty which I really appreciate! They taste alright and the waiting staff are less helpful in making recommendations than we'd wish they are.\", 'This place has unfortunately gone downhill since I first visited back in 2021. While the cocktails here are still consistently good, the food can be a hit or miss (lately the latter). I recently had a weekday dinner here (with no wait) and tried the following:- Frijolitos con chips (0/5): What a disappointment! The bean dip was so watered down that I would consider this bean water or bean juice (with no pulp) instead of a dip. There\\'s also supposed to be queso in this, but I didn\\'t see any. This was the biggest disappointment of the night because the bean dip here was so much better when I first had it over a year ago.- Cod tostada (2/5): This was somewhat bland, and the tostada can easily be mistaken for something found at a fast food chain. The redeeming factor was the cod, but there were so few tiny pieces of cod. - Grilled pork ala pastor (3/5): The pork was flavorful and juicy, and I liked the texture of the tortilla. But the \"refried beans\" were more watery/liquid than refried, and the \"green rice\" tasted like plain rice. - Jalisco 75 cocktail (4.5/5): I really enjoyed this tequila cocktail! It was refreshing, and the elderflower really shined through nicely. Overall, this was a disappointing experience. I\\'d stop by Otra for a cocktail before dinner, but I\\'m not sure if I\\'d want to risk another bad dinner here unless the food quality picks back up again.', \"Really cute decor and a very popular restaurant. We waited a while for a table on Friday night. We ordered the chips and salsa, mushroom tacos, beef tacos, cod tostados, and the kampachi. They have good veggie options as my vegan friend also ordered sweet potato tacos and the carrot tostados. Our server was super friendly and great, but unfortunately the food was overall just okay for me. Maybe slightly better than avg tacos but I might have had higher expectations given the reviews. The cod was a bit dry and my favorite dish were the beef tacos. It's still worth giving this place a try though!\", 'Got a question about Otra? Ask the Yelp community!', 'We came in for a late dinner and focused on their veggie offerings. The highlight was the charred cabbage salad which was smoky and tasty. We tried some tacos as well. The mushroom tacos were over seasoned and salty although my dining partner liked them.  The salad could\" have been more thoroughly dressed as there were lots of bites that just tasted like plain kale. A nice venue, good veggie selection. I\\'d come back and give it another', \"Outstanding find in the Bay Area! The mushroom tacos with cojita cheese are unparalleled. Beef tacos boast juicy, citrusy flavors with the perfect salty-spicy balance. Don't miss the fiery kick of the spicy mezcal margarita with its zesty sea salt rim. Ceviche is a must-try appetizer, while the chips and frijolito dip are a flavorful delight. House-made hot sauce adds an extra kick. Reasonable prices round out the experience.\", \"Went here with a friend who's a vegetarian (and chose this place for being veggie friendly). I'm happy she chose this place! The service is friendly and pretty quick. They have a cute parklet and a few sidewalk tables, which is really nice for warm days/nights! They also have heat lamps. I got the fish tostada and it was just ok...the mushroom and sweet potato tacos were actually the standouts for me! So much flavor for things that don't have meat! ;)As a meat lover, I would recommend this place for anyone to try. But try the veggie options because I think they're better!\", \"Fun weekday spot for good Tapas.Arrived at 6:30 on Wednesday night and got seated right away in the back. Note there is no cell service in the back of the restaurant (not a big deal but something to note).We started out with the Aguachile which was phenomenal but really spicy. If you get this, it is really great but expect some spice because it's got some heat!We then also had the chips and salsa (first thing on the top of the menu), which was great as well. The chips are thick and the salsa is smoky and delicious - exactly how I like it.We got the cabbage salad which was crispy and flavorful. This isn't something I've ever had before, but it was really unique. Would get again.For our mains we split the beef tacos, fish tacos and the pork tenderloin main entree. The beef tacos and pork tenderloin were. phenomenal. Very flavorful and nicely balanced.The only part of the mean that I really did not enjoy were the fish tacos. They were really fishy and not super appetizing. I couldn't eat my portion and no one else from our party ate their full portion either. This felt like a miss when everything else was so good.Overall I would definitely come back.\", \"I am having a full love affair with Otra! Food is so flavorful, the Brussels sprouts are a must have, ceviche, tacos, you can't go wrong. Their Escondido cocktail might be my fav in the city, and I don't even like gin. Fun vibe inside, it's perfect for happy hour or date night!\", 'First of all the food here is absolutely delicious. Started off with one of their lime aid beverages, and it was fantastic I had to. I could not get enough of it. Then I ordered chips and salsa, one with heirloom, roasted tomatoes, and another with a moly that was absolutely astonishing. I do highly recommend. The ceviche is copious and delightful. Very tasty. I had the meatballs (albondigas) they we hearty, smoky, just enough spice, and filling. Last but not least I had the coconut flan that was beyond exceptional and a rare find. This places has copious seating, couples, families, and perfect for large groups. ADA accessible ramp to the upper dining area and outdoor seating and cool vibes devour makes this a major find in my book and an absolute gem of the neighborhood! The service was prompt, and the food runners last the ensure food coming to table in why can be a fast paced eating environment.', 'Great drinks. Food was fine but overpriced for what it was. The vibe was a little stale', 'small menu but a fun place to have dinner. we had the kanpachi and tacos. the carnitas and beef tacos are great. service is slow', \"Some of the most flavorful vegetarian tacos I've had in the Bay Area! Loads of options and great service! Will definitely be coming back!\", \"Nice little place with indoor and outdoor seating. We arrived early- 5:30 or so- and we had the indoor seating to ourselves for maybe 10 minutes, then it completely filled up by 6pm.... So get there early. Excellent Cerviche, probably one of the best we've had, with a generous serving with lots of shrimp, avo, cokes, hearty juice- so ask for extra chips. We had carnitas and carne asada tacos, both were excellent but the asada had bigger flavor. The cocktails were also excellent- the spicy margarita is really spicy- and the Paloma was made with fresh grapefruit juice. Glad we found this little spot. Four cocktails total, appetizer Cerviche and two orders of tacos (two per order, we shared one each) was $120.00 before tip, which seems to be pretty typical for SF these days.\"]\n",

      "Reviews: ['The food were top-notch and has excellent quality.  I like the Vegan Lasagna and Pork cheeks which has nice flavor, it was well-cooked and it taste so fantastic. Everything was well-done.Amazing cocktail drinks. Lovely place, with good lighting, and nice seating inside. It was wonderful place with a pleasant ambiance. The staff were so friendly.', \"We went here for brunch. We sat on the back patio. They have heaters which is nice considering SF is often chilly. The ambience was nice.I ordered the quinoa brunch bowl. It was basically just a big bowl of dry quinoa. My friend ordered the same thing and made the comment she had almost no arugula in it. I think I had 1 piece of cauliflower. Supposedly it had a vinaigrette on it, but I felt it had absolutely no flavor. The worst part is I had hard egg shell in my dish. Thankfully the restaurant took this dish off our bill to compensate, but it kind of ruined the whole meal for me. My husband got the Media Noche Sandwich. He liked it, and I had half and thought it was fine. The dishes are pretty large. Pricing is about $40/couple. I didn't feel very excited about anything on the menu, and probably will not return.\", \"Fable is my go to. It never disappoints for a date night, from the food to the wine selection everything here is on point. This is my go to for every date night because me and my partner always leave pleased. The servers are always friendly and well mannered. Service and food matter and finding a favorite restaurant is hard. This place deserves a A + for effort and I'll always be a loyal customer. Would I recommend- Absolutely\", \"Fable came a bit short of my expectations, unfortunately. The patio for brunch needs to be reserved way in advance, so I wasn't able to check it out, but the parklet in the front was lovely too. I like how this place places a great emphasis on outdoor dining! Service was quite slow. It seems like there were only about two people working, during weekend brunch hours. It took us a long time to get seated even though I noticed that there were vacant tables. The brunch menu was quite limited, and I was disappointed that there wasn't a vegetarian omelet or scramble dish. I ended up getting the chilaquiles, even though that wasn't quite what I was in the mood for at the time. The chilaquiles were good, but I think that if there were more menu options to choose from, I would have had a better experience.\", 'Sammy and Wine   On my day trip to The Castro area of SF, we started with a small bite and afternoon splash.  Waitress was helpful in picking best of the sandwiches (her favorite was the turkey). Perfect focaccia bread, toasted turkey, meaty cheese, smooth avocado  paired the Sammy with a bottom of white wine and could not be happier.  We got sat in the back courtyard and let me tell you about serene. It was cozy with an open roof to the sky.  Beautiful. Will be back for lunch again tomorrow', \"I came here for brunch with a friend in their backyard patio. It was decorated with vibrant colors, definitely a vibe, and it also got pretty hot from the greenhouse effect of their roof as it was a rare sunny day in SF this July. The server was great with refilling our water.I got a generous portion of perfectly runny Eggs Benedict with crispy potatoes, and my friend got the Fried Chicken Sandwich (not pictured) with a margarita. Would love to come back when I'm not hungover to try their cute drinks!\", 'We came here for a work dinner and sat in the patio.The patio was an unexpected pretty oasis in the middle of the inner city.Service was delightful.We had a prefix menu and I got the steak, which was done perfectly. The macaroni and cheese side was delicious. I also really enjoyed their melon salad.We brought our own alcohol, which was nice. Not sure if we were charged a corkage fee. It was a lovely evening and I would definitely return on my own.', \"Note: If you're looking at the hours on here, they're incorrect. They're open for brunch everyday except for Sat & Sun from 11:30 am to 3 pm and dinner everyday from 5 pm to 10 pm! Happy hour 3 pm to 6 pm.Okay, let's get into it.. food was alright! The oven roasted chicken was good, nothing that was a wow factor but good and did the job! Loved the focaccia bread that it came on! The double cheeseburger is on the smaller side and cooked about medium! Same thing, wasn't a wow factor but didn't dislike it either. Fries came out perfectly hot and crispy! Service was great. Open seating on a Thursday in their back patio. Loved the lushness in the back and how happy it made you feel! Great ambience for a day out with friends or a day date!\", \"This nice place to go on a Sunday for brunch. They have plenty of seating outdoors, so you don't have to wait long. They are attentive and offer proper service. The food was delicious. I got the salmon with  greens. There was plenty of it too. Make sure your entire party is there before seating. I will be coming back.\", 'My friends and I booked a large table in the back of Fable on a Friday night. It was ideal to eat as a group - they did ask us to place our orders all at once. They have a cute backyard with heat lamps, which you would never know from the street looking at the storefront.I got the pan roasted Rocky Jr chicken, which I give 4/5 stars. The chicken was tender and perfectly cooked and the salad was luscious and full of delicious plums, apricots, and homemade croutons. The chicken was not super flavorful but overall a great dish.Two of my friends got the vegan lasagna which I tried - it came with a spicy red sauce, delicious noodles with bits of zucchini and vegan cheese crumble on top. Personally, I think the sauce had a little too much pepper/salt but my non-Italian friends both loved it. Would definitely recommend for vegans. My other friend got the pan seared salmon with quinoa and absolutely adored it.Lastly there is the mac and cheese, which is so hard to find in the Bay Area. The whole table adored this side dish, which was topped with Parmesan cheese. As a mac and cheese aficionado, I would come back just for this.', 'No Fees', 'Quick and helpful servers.

Portion was big, bread that came with it was also filling, and mussels and broth were flavorful. We tried the chocolate dessert and strawberry shortcake. The shortcake texture was light and not heavy or dry. The filling/strawberries were soft and good balance. The chocolate was light and not overly sweet which I appreciated. We sat on the back patio which is really cute and had heat lamps. Our server checked on us and was patient as we were slow to order. Definitely recommend and hope to come back sooner than last time\", 'This place is a really wonderful spot to grab wine, cocktails, or dinner in the Castro.  There is a wonderful courtyard in the middle with a tiki feel that adds to the chill vibe of the place.  The menu is very good and vegetarian friendly, and there are non-alcoholic wines and cocktails in addition to the fully-leaded variety.  Highly recommended.', 'Not bad but not amazing either. The food is okay. I had the breakfast sandwich (egg and cheese) and it fell apart. Not much flavor. Server kind of interrupted our conversations a lot but I understand she had a job to do.

I can see myself visiting again for trying out other items on their menu.', \"Grilled local rock cod tacos were delicious. The fish meat was steaming warm and filling, and the flavors were on point. The citrus and endive salad with roasted pistachio vinaigrette (with crab meat add-on!) was great too. The salad was light, refreshing, and flavorful, and as a non-SF local, I was really impressed with how fresh the crab meat was. I'm really glad we decided to add the crab meat--I think it's definitely a must-get!The outdoor patio environment is really cute, but one con: it's very noisy.

Either that or learn some ASL :)\", 'Overall Experience: 5Food: 5Service: 5Atmosphere: 5Value: depends Pros: The serving sizes for our entrees were HUGE. Definitely more than enough food. Also, the mussels appetizer is such a good deal and so delicious. The flavors of the appetizers and entrees were spot on and included some very interesting ingredients! The atmosphere of the outdoor dining space was super adorable and made for the perfect romantic date night. Cons: The stuffed fish was around $36 and although it was good, this is pretty pricey compared to their other menu items. The bathroom also felt a little dirty. Their desserts were not the best in my opinion and were far pricier than their other menu items. If I were to come here again, I would definitely skip the dessert menu.', 'Super cute outdoor dining area.  Food was good and service was also good.

I went there with my wife and some friends for brunch. We didn't have a reservation and showed up right when they opened, so understandably they seated reservations first, but we were able to get a table, the manager said he could make it work if we ate and left within an hour because they had another reservation scheduled.We sat in their outdoor covered patio which was really nice and pretty sturdy, it was raining while we were there and we were dry as a bone.Our server recommended their chocolate banana bread which was super yummy, I love how banana and zucchini breads for example have so much sugar in them that probably evens out at health content the fruits or veggies had. I really enjoyed the Fried Chicken Sandwich and their fries were pretty good too. I'd try it again, maybe make a reservation next time.\", \"Went for brunch and the service was great! If you have a reservation, you'll need to make sure most of your party is there because they won't give you the table otherwise. They hold reservations for 10 minutes only. Our server was great!

We ordered the dishes below and would definitely recommend for brunch:- chilaquiles- egg sandwich- quinoa boal- grapefruit juice\", 'The ambience is just incredible at this cute brunch spot. Loved my Chilaquiles which is high praise because I usually find this dish too tomato-y. This one was perfectly done and topped with a fluffy egg and cheese.

Wandering around the Castro looking for a late lunch and saw Fable. I wasn't sure about this place cause nobody was in the parklet & it looked so dark inside. Who knew, there's an awesome outdoor patio in back. That's where everyone was. I noticed a lot of wine & beer day drinking, hence, the merry mood.Loved the setting, large overhead, vine covered trellis, lots of light. I ordered my twice a year hamburger- so going all the way with the 1/2 lb double cheeseburger, side of fries. Man, so delicious, the fries were crispy & lightly salted. The burger was dripping cheese, elevated with dill pickle, lettuce, & tomato. I skipped the aioli, cause, yuck. My friend got the Caesar with added chicken. He didn't like the chicken, turned off cause the strips were green. I guess he doesn't like pesto & regretted he didn't get the fried chicken salad, which he enjoyed last time.We were given a large carafe of water and iced black tea refills.With tip we paid about $75. Yipes. But I will definitely come back on a nice day & sit in the outdoor patio.\", 'Picked Fable for a birthday brunch with a group of 10 because it was one of the few brunch places in SF I could find that accepted reservations.The back patio is pretty cute, and though it was rainy we were completely covered and dry.

We shared the banana bread and enjoyed it, and I was very full/satisfied after eating my fried chicken sandwich.Service was nice/friendly as well!', \"The restaurant itself is beautiful and super pretty, and the service is great. The fondue was good, would've preferred thicker chips or a heavier fondue, it was pretty watery. The chicken was great in my opinion, cooked really well and loved the filling. I would order again. The jerk pork shank seemed more braised than anything, and we were not told ahead of time that they were out of brussel sprouts and pancetta, which is part of why the dish was ordered versus another. It was a hearty portion which was nice. The halibut was the least flavorful and not a favorite.\", \"Although I've heard many good things about brunch here I've never been for brunch. We did go for dinner yesterday and had a great dining experience. The food was very delicious with a very delightful ambience and environment. We had dinner in the rear garden, which is very nice.

He had asked if we had reservations (we did not), but very kindly let us know that they'd be open shortly. Once the outdoor back patio was ready, he came and got us from out front of the restaurant. By the way, if you ever have the option to eat indoors or out in the back patio...GO TO THE PATIO! It's beautifully set with seating surrounded by greenery and covered in shade. The first time I came here it was lightly raining and it was BEAUTIFUL to sit out there and listen to the rain while eating. Today was a Thursday and by 6pm, the restaurant was filling quickly. Might be best to make reservations. Just in case. I want to highlight the host for a second in hopes that the manager sees this. He sat an elderly couple next to us and was EXTREMELY patient and kind. The elderly woman had accidentally knocked over the seat cushion from the bench. She was using a cane to walk with and couldn't get it from the floor herself. He helped get it back from behind the bench and placed it for her. It was just a very genuine act of human kindness and was pleased to see the great employees they hire here.Now...for the food. Oh. My. Goodness. The waiter suggested we try the Roasted Maitake, King Trumpet & Pink Oyster Mushroom Toast. It was full of flavor and beautifully plated. We also ordered the 12 oz Grilled NY Strip Steak and the Pan Seared Alaskan Halibut. Everything was cooked to perfection. One thing I love about this place is that the menu seems to change which is great for variety. I can't wait to come back again and try something new!\", \"Our group of three came here for Sunday brunch and were able to be seated outside in the parklet immediately. Note that the back patio is only available by reservation. For food, I had a steak benedict. I loved how the egg and steak were served on top of focaccia. It was tasty and not too heavy. The chocolate chip banana bread was a nice sweet treat as well. I got a iced coffee, which felt a bit watered down for my taste. The outside parklet was cute, and I loved the plant theme throughout the restaurant. Our server was friendly, and the food came out quickly.  I later realized that we were incorrectly charged extra for part of our order, so I left a voicemail with the restaurant. I didn't hear back after a few days, so I called again and was put in touch with the manager who quickly corrected the charge which I really appreciated!\", 'It\\'s all about the backyard.  On a sparkling sunny day following the season\\'s 11th atmospheric river, Fable\\'s backyard patio was the place to be.  With my party of 8, we walked through the restaurant\\'s interior to emerge in the backyard space and I heard audible gasps of joy from some in my group who were surprised in the best of ways.  The backyard space is a charmer.As a Castro Street regular who is generally dining solo while in the area, Fable has never risen to the top of my list.  It seems more of a splurge place than a solo dining spot but I\\'m happy to report that the splurge is very reasonable considering 2023 restaurant prices.  Here, meal-sized salads, burgers, and other menu items can be had at lunch for under $20.  This was a most pleasant surprise given the surroundings and the fact that Fable is a full-service restaurant.  I didn\\'t take a poll, but my hunch - based on my personal experience - is that the backyard is the reason you go here and the food is nice accompaniment.  My Cobb Salad ($18) was well composed and hosted a satisfying array of fresh, quality ingredients.  At my table, all food was consumed but we failed to reach the \"ooh\" and \"aah\" of truly memorable food; that was reserved for the setting.  I was happily pleased with Fable.  The reason to enjoy a meal there is the opportunity to sit in that attractive, leafy, green backyard.  The meal is your price of admission.', 'Loved the patio! I just wished they had music there too. The food was delicious, and service was great.', \"Meh. Very pleasant patio and nice service. But the tap water had a really odd taste, which added about $10 in bottled substitutes to our tab. The fried chicken in the sandwich was greasy and the Caesar salad we split was tasty but not like any Caesar dressing I've ever had - more a mustard vinaigrette. For $78 pre-tip, I would not return.\", 'Ive been excited to come to Fable for some time since they take reservations and have a beautiful patio! I had made reservations for 2 on the weekend, and we were seated on the patio. The menu online had shown lattes and other coffees, but when we asked the server we were told they only had straight espresso. I had asked if they could pour it over ice and bring a side of almond milk but was told no. I found that to be very odd.I ordered the omelette, it was over cooked and covered in salsa (not mentioned on the menu). The potatoes were also covered in so much seasoning it was all I could taste on the plate. My friend had ordered the French toast, she said it was good but nothing special and the way it was served was hard to eat. If I was in the area, I would give Fable another try but unfortunately I was not impressed with my first visit.', 'Make reservations!While we awaited the opening, a few people strolled. by and mentioned that this is one of the best restaurants on the Castro.We sat on the beautiful outdoor garden patio next to a trickling fountain.  We ordered the peaches with housemade ricotta, NY steak, .and a cheeseburger. The starter of peaches and housemade ricotta was innovative and memorable.Our burger was brought with cheese (we had asked without), but while they corrected it, we devoured the steak, which was delicious. The Au gratin potatoes were especially good. The burger was fairly pedestrian.', 'The red quinoa bowl - served warm - is delicious and surprisingly filling. The \"not so skinny\" Paloma is deceiving. At first I couldn\\'t taste the alcohol. But half an hour later it hit me hard!They have one of the prettiest patios in San Francisco. Brunch for 4, plus 2 drinks - $130 before tax and tip.', \"Love a good brunch and this spot was perfect for a sunday brunch with our group of 5. We had a reservation and I love that they do take reservations when many places don't!Food was good, not my most favorite though! Most notable options were the egg sandwich and the friend chicken sandwich. So yummy! Pro Tip: Def add an egg to the chicken sandwich!Coffee selection is limited to just hot or cold coffee - but drink selections looked amazing!! There's a 75min table limit depending on the line for brunch, so be aware if you plan to just hang for a while.Also HUGE plus is their patio is pet friendly!! Love this fact and love that the weather was sooo nice while we were there!\", 'No Fees']\n",

      "Reviews: [\"One of the town's best for at least the 15 years I've been dining there. Open 7 days; indoor & street (park let) seating available. Some of the best Italian food in the city- featuring a rotating menu with everything from fresh,  house made pastas (my wife loves the gnocchi) to steaks and pork roasts. I've yet to order anything from the menu that disappoints. If there is room for desert- Seven Hills absolutely NAILS Panna Cotta... especially paired with a 10 or 20 year tawny. Arrive hungry and leave completely satisfied. The service is impeccable and the ambiance is both cozy and classy.\", \"Seven Hills was recommended to us by a couple of friends, definitely lives up to the hype! We came here for our anniversary dinner and it fit the vibe. We got the squid ink pasta, kale pasta, meatballs and focaccia. The squid ink pasta and meatballs were my favorite dishes. The meatballs had cheese inside, which I haven't seen at many places. The sauce was delicious, we finished the rest of the focaccia by dipping it into the sauce. Service was amazing, the waiter kept checking with us from time to time. Parking sucks in this area so I recommend parking on Polk and walking there.\", \"Love this place and finally took my husband for our anniversary dinner. Usually this was been my girls night out spot! I always get the truffle pasta. It's an off menu order but it's usually available. One order has ten pieces of stuffed pasta topped with freshly shaved truffles. I would suggest to split it. It's rich and you want to be able to enjoy other items. We also did the carpaccio salad. Though we notified the server about my seafood allergy they were super good and remade my dish sans seafood, the bagna caudo is anchovies :) We also shared their house special pasta with ricotta, tomato sauce and chili and my husband I both agreed this is the start of the night. Paired with the meatballs it was perfect to share. Chewy and Al dente pasta with light sauce, tiny bit of heat and rich cheese really hit the spot. The best part of the night was the dessert. We shared a budino which is my absolute favorite dessert and this place nails it perfectly. One of the best I've ever had. They also generously gifted us a sparkling muscato and ice cream. Please tip your server well and come to this local treasure! Let's keep restaurants like this in business. They truly care about quality, service, ambiance and overall experience. One pro tip. Don't bring kids here. While you can it's a quaint place to be enjoyed sans iPads or such. Please please do not ruin it for other diners by doing so even if it is an early reservations. Part of the charm of this place is the ambiance.\", \"I recently dined at Seven Hills Italian restaurant and had an incredible experience. From the moment we arrived, it was clear that this place stands out.Despite a slight delay with our reserved table, the staff quickly made amends by seating us at the bar and promptly served us drinks and water while we waited. As soon as our table became available, it was cleaned and ready for us.The food was the highlight of our evening. I started with the herb focaccia, and it was the perfect prelude to what was to come. The real star of the evening was the triangoli, which had an intensely rich squash flavor. It was unlike any Italian dish I've ever had, and it has instantly become my new favorite in San Francisco.What truly sets Seven Hill apart, though, is the speed of service. Our food arrived within a mere 5 minutes of ordering, and every dish was fresh and bursting with flavor. The attentive staff and their commitment to customer satisfaction were evident throughout our visit.Seven Hill Italian restaurant has made a lasting impression on me. From the warm service to the exceptional food, it's clear that this place knows how to create a memorable dining experience. I can't wait to return and explore more of their menu. Highly recommended!\", 'Very solid.This place did not blow my mind but it was a solid meal. The macaroni had a very satisfying tomato sauce. Fresh, herby, but not too salty. The tomato sauce was very very good. Almost perfrct. Thr dish went very well with the ricotta cheese. The', 'After walking for 9 miles around SF and on mostly over 1,000+ feet of elevation, we were so glad that this place was just couple of miles away from Lombard Street, where our internal batteries were just about drained from all the sight-seeing and walking.  It was too late for us to make reservations, so we called and asked if they had any seating availability. Thankfully, they did, but only at their outdoor patio, which wasn\\'t a popular choice at the time because it was freezing cold outside, but nothing a heating lamp can\\'t remedy.  In fact, they had multiple, warm enough and perfect for our hangry tummies.Of course, me and my young piggies ordered multiple items for our starved bellies and devoured each one swiftly, like a bolt of lightning LOL.  One we were starving, but also the food was amazing, especially their TOASTED GARLIC FOCACCIA BREAD.  It was so good, we ordered 3!  The other favorite was their TOMATO BRAISED POLPETTE, which the kids ordered as a meal paired with the MACCHERONCELLI, which they satisfyingly inhaled!I ordered their \"Market Fish,\" and at that time, it was the BLACK COD, which was deliciously prepared. It was moist, and every bite melted in your mouth so lusciously.  I paired this with their ORECCHIETTE pasta.  It was a bit much, and it felt heavy afterward, but my eyes were hungrier than my tummy.  The Orechiette was good, but it\\'s something I wouldn\\'t order again because of its density and rich sauce. It\\'s filling yet unsatisfying.Two of my nieces ordered their PAPPARDELLE with tomato and chili braised pork shank sugo, and they both loved it!  My son ordered the TORTELLI and paired it with their Tomato Braised Polpette. Their portions are small, hence multiple pairings of items.  Prices are average for the area, meaning it\\'s not your typical cheapskate Italian place.Our server was lively and cheery. He was informative as well and patient to go over their menu and specials in great detail.Although it was cold seated outside, we enjoyed the quaint, yet charming outdoor seating. Overall, we enjoyed dining here, and it\\'s walking distance from Lombard Street and a perfect place to grab a decent meal after a long, tiring walk around the city.', \"After our meal, we felt pleasantly relaxed. The atmosphere is cozy and intimate, making it an ideal spot for a hearty dinner before winding down. If you're after a calm, hygge-like evening, this is the place. Russian Hill is peaceful at night.Now, about the food:1. The TRIANGOLI pasta was outstanding. The honey nut squash filling was velvety, with a rich, buttery flavor, complemented by nuts and pomegranate. Truly a delectable masterpiece! I'd revisit this restaurant just for this dish, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to fellow diners. Each bite was a heavenly experience, leaving me longing for more.2. The Maccheroncelli lived up to its reputation as the signature pasta. The light tomato sauce and fresh ricotta cheese were a nostalgic touch. It summoned memories of childhood pasta. For me, the ricotta was the star of this dish.3. Orecchiette provided a satisfying chew, with a tougher pasta. I initially anticipated nuts, the more conventional choice, but the beans brought forth the perfect texture! As for the Garlic & Parmesan Focaccia, I can't recall much - it disappeared quickly!\", \"Recently came here to celebrated a birthday party for a table of 7.  We had a Prix Fixe dinner menu with a few additional a la carte items and omg, everything was so yummy.  A friend of ours brought a bottle of 2016 cab with a $30 corkage fee and we ordered another bottle of red while waiting for the first to be aerated, great wine and pasta just hits different.  Outside of our Prix Fixe menu, we also ordered the White Truffle Pasta ($80) and Uni Tomato Neri (Squid Ink $38) which knocked all our socks off, both dishes were rich, creamy and flavorful.  Everything on the PF menu was a hit; however, Maccheroncelli could have been skipped IMO.. the texture was a tad rough to chew, the flavor was there but none of us finished the dish.Overall, had a wonderful experience.  Our server was very knowledgeable and matched our degenerate energy.  I'd like to come back on a normal occasion to select from the menu or chef's special.\", \"The food here was spectacular. Every thing we ordered was delicious and surprisingly flavorful. The tomato soup starter was so amazing, my partner said he didn't want any, but then ended up eating half of mine. The corn agnolotti was also incredible, we licked the plate and would come back just for this. The basic marinara pasta, we didn't expect much from, but it was topped with a delicious ricotta cheese that we couldn't get enough of. The dessert was very good, but this one didn't blow us away as much as the other dishes. If I could I would give it 4.5 stars because although the food was incredible, it was overpriced. In my opinion the quality was similar to another nearby restaurant that has significantly lower prices. However, my ratings are based on deliciousness of food more than any other factor, so they get a 5 in that department.\", \"The food was a little overpriced for the experience. Service was friendly and attentive. Inside is a little dark and quaint so we decided to sit outside. The street seating is nice but the benches are a little bit high for the table. Food was good but not all the dishes were fantastic. Here are my reviews:Duck liver pate: was a little too sweet. Pate is alway rich, but this was exceptionally rich and sweet. The portions are big! Summer bean salad: nothing special. Good salad. I wouldn't reproduce. Pork chop: was one of the best dishes, the pork was tender and the grain was a delicious combination with the pork. Squid ink pasta: also was underwhelming, the flavor profile was not memorable. It was a tart tomato, salty combination Panna cotta: best part of the meal. Not too sweet, not too creamy. It was a perfectly light texture with a subtly sweet touch.  I would recommend the location overall!\", \"Beautiful Italian restaurant, although next time I think I'll sit inside. Wasn't a fan of the trolley passing by ever so often. Service was meh... it sucked lol but at least we had wine to hold us over. Food was amazing though! Definitely come for the food and bring good company. Thanks!\", \"Birthday dinner!!! Small restaurant made for dates or perhaps solo dinners. Came here for my reservation at 6:15. It was pretty busy for a Sunday evening. The waiters weren't very attentive. It took quite some time for them to get water, order food, or even just to see how we were doing. The food was good but not great. My duck liver pate as a starter was wonderful. It was flavorful and they gave me a good amount. My black cod was was cooked beautifully. The pork chop was a very different story. It was mostly fat. My boyfriend said he had to cut most of the fat off. It was very difficult to eat. They make their own sorbet in house. I enjoyed it, but it didn't sparkle. I wouldn't get it again.\", \"My new favorite Italian restaurant of all time!Came here for dinner and was greeted / seated immediately (they take reservations online, which is highly recommended because this place gets packed quickly). The inside is dark and romantic but very comfortable and effortless. This spot would be great for date night.I shared the herby focaccia, Sun Blaze Ranch Panzanella Salad, and  Chocolate Budino for dessert. For my entree I got the Agnolotti.Wow, all dishes were fantastic! The focaccia was airy. The heirloom tomatoes in the salad were meaty and juicy and seasoned to perfection. The Agnolotti was so unexpected but I loved it. It was essentially ravioli but with seasonal sweet corn. It also had some popcorn sprinkled on top. The dish was light and on the sweeter side. The Chocolate Budino was also amazing! The mousse/pudding wasn't too sweet. I was impressed. I'm a pretty big eater and I felt the portions for each dish were just right.Service was top notch. They checked on us frequently, asked if we had any food allergies before we ordered, refilled our waters, and wiped the table between courses. Everyone thanked us and wished us a good evening on our way out.I will be back to Seven Hills and would recommend this place to my family and friends!\", \"I had a fantastic dining experience at Seven Hills! Dining with friends from out of town, we were warmly welcomed by our attentive waiter, William H. His passion for food and attention to detail made us feel truly special. The restaurant's lively yet intimate ambiance added to the overall charm. The Americano Spritz was excellent, perfect for spritz enthusiasts like me. As for the food, the garlic parmesan bread and pappardelle were incredibly flavorful. No regrets here; I'm already planning my next visit to try more of their food!\", \"We celebrated my husbands birthday in the city! We made reservations in advance and were seated upon our arrival. We sat indoors as it gets cool in the evening. Table are a bit closer together but it is still cozy. The staff was friendly and personable. We had the American wagyu, marccheroncelli and the market fish. Food was simply delicious. Our server paired our food with a delicious red wine. If you're ever in the city we highly recommend seven hills it's a solid Italian spot !\", \"Seven Hills is one of my favorite date night restaurants-- the pastas change and are always the perfect al dente that reminds me what pasta texture should be. I'm always curious what new combination of house made pastas and sauces they will have on their menu. There are typically some chef specials as well with great, fresh ingredients. I have not tried them yet since they are usually pricier but it is on my bucket list. The duck liver pate had great umami flavor and I really appreciated the strawberries. I also always love their panna cotta and olive oil cake. Service was impeccable and as a light drinker, they were more than accommodating in splitting one glass of wine between my guest and I. Great wine selection too and we really enjoyed the sauvignon we picked.\", \"Oh my gosh. This is the best food and dining experience I've ever had! My bf and I came last night after hearing great things about it and boy we were not disappointed. Everything is fresh and prepared to perfection. Our server William made the experience even better! He gave us great recommendations and ensured that there was more than enough truffles on our pasta (doing the lords work lol). If you haven't come here yet, I'd make sure to make a reservation ASAP. You won't be disappointed.\", \"One of the top 10 Italian restaurants we've been to. And that says a lot from people living in nyc. The meatballs are the best we've ever had (also impressive coming from nyc). The garlic bread, kale tagliatelle and macorencelli all fantastic.\", \"Seven Hills is a cute Italian restaurant tucked away in the sleepy Nob Hill neighborhood. We made reservations for three at 5:30p and were seated in the back of the main dining room. Garlic & Parmesan Focaccia: this was buttery, soft, and cheesy! So delicious to share.Duck Liver Pate: this was the STAR of the show. The focaccia bread it was served on was crispy yet fluffy and the pate was delicious. I loved the strawberry jam on top to help cut the pungent-ness of the pate. Would 100% order again Agnolotti: this was a perfectly cooked Al dente pasta. I really enjoyed the fresh corn and the fun popcorn on top. Budino: creamy, luscious, I couldn't stop eating this! The food was excellent - I wish the pasta portions were 25% bigger. If we didn't order appetizers I think I would still be hungry. Overall I would say the service is pretty good, although I we did feel a bit rushed to order, to eat, and to order more wine. Our party was catching up with a friend visiting from out of town so it would've been nice to have a bit more space during the actual dinner. I do appreciate Seven Hills for letting us move to a new table for a post-dinner drink and to finish our Budino dessert before our friend's plane ride home.\", \"A Russian hill classic. If you're looking for an Italian restaurant in Russian Hill, Seven Hills is the best option.I come here pretty frequently, as it's two blocks away from my house.We always get a crudo and salad to start, three pastas (truffle tortellini, squid ink if they have it - these two are typically specials), and a protein (fish or steak). Save some room for dessert at Swenson's across the street, but if you stay for dessert, they have an excellent panna cotta.\", \"Seven hills is such a delight.A dark and warm lit restaurant, seven hills is such a staple to the neighborhood. The people there make you feel like you're a regular, and service is absolute filled with love. With an in depth knowledge of the menu and wine selection, the servers were so helpful in our decision. The focaccia bread is the ultimate star of the show, along with the squid ink pasta which I believe may be a seasonal choice. You cannot go wrong with any choice on the menu. Each bite is the perfect balance of flavor and texture. Definitely a great spot for friends, family, dates, and maybe even for a work dinner! Casual yet upscale.\", 'We live in the neighborhood and come often.  When I made the reservation for a birthday dinner (4 of us) for tonight through Open Table, I requested their wonderful table tucked away next to the bar.  I don\\'t have enough words of thanks to Seven Hills for that perfect table:  THANK YOU, THANK, THANK YOU.  Score!  We had the best possible time.  The food was simply outstanding.  The Little Gem Salad with Point Reyes Blue Cheese was extraordinary -- perfectly dressed, great texture, sublime.  The pastas were amazing, and our friend who ordered the scallops (a \"special\" tonight) will be raving about those scallops forever (she normally doesn\\'t finish her dinner whenever we go out -- tonight she ate every bite!).  Desserts all around were incredible.  Delicious wine.  Terrific ambience -- nice and quiet.  I wish I could give a million stars here on Yelp.  Thank you, Seven Hills.  BRAVO!!!', \"Parking is horrible, so I Ubered from Embarcadero and walked back. Food was delish and service was great. Place looks small, but there is a plenty of tables, a touch too close together. I can't remember everything I got since they change their menu often. I know the tuna tartar was really fresh and good. The Duck Liver Pâté comes on a big pieces of bread all ready for you to eat. It was delish. Their pasta is cooked perfectly and every piece of pasta was coated perfectly with the perfect amount of sauce. I know we got something with truffle and the squid ink pasta. Big thumbs up!\", 'Reserved online for 2 and came here on a weekend. I love this spot\\'s atmosphere and vibe, reminds me of a \"classic italian restaurant\" vibe that\\'s just perfect for anything. The service was great as well, our server was knowledgeable and able to recommend a few wines to complement our meal.The white wine was perfectly light and citrusy. The Strawberry Solstice was also light, but the strawberry/lemon and vermouth was perfectly sweet to complement a laid back meal.We ordered a handle of dishes and dessert to share. We got an Carpaccio, Agnolotti, a Dungeness crabspecial, and a Chocolate Budino. I found the the carpaccio and agnolotti decent, but for me the Dungeness crab special was the crème de la crème imo. It was delicious with black pasta and the crab was soft and juicy. This was my favorite dish of the evening.The Budino was beautiful and well worth. The biscotti dipped in the sea salt/cream and a bit of hazelnut was mouth watering. In hindsight, probably should have mixed the hazelnut and cream more, but we ate top down.Every time I go here, I am always satisfied by the atmosphere, service, the drinks and dessert, and at least 1-2 of the entrees/antipastas blow me away. Definitely a 5/5', \"I had such a nice dinner here on a Monday night. I ended up walking in and it was pretty busy. A lot of places in the neighborhood are closed on Monday so the host told me they get busy on those nights. This spot is definitely pricey. My friend and I had a bottle of wine, 1 app, 2 pastas and 2 desserts and our bill was about $234 without tip. Obviously we went all in but it was worth it and a nice treat to ourselves. I sat at the bar with a girlfriend and we loved everything. We got a bottle of red, a fish carpaccio which I cannot find on the menu I posted, the special which was a truffle tortellini, the maccheroncelli, the date dessert cake and chocolate mousse. Everything was really good. The one that stood out the most was the special, truffle tortellini. It was pricey, $56 but I think it was worth it. It had 10 tortellinis for the entree. I wouldn't have shared it if I knew how delicious it was haha, don't get me wrong the maccheroncelli was good but it stays on the menu. The dessert date cake was also a highlight for me. It was sooo good. The whipped cream was perfect. The service was great, our server was Ashton and he was so kind and helpful with the menu. We asked for his suggestions and he made the best recommendations. We loved everything we ordered.\", \"One on my favorite local Italian spots. Every time I return, it just reinforces the reason why I keep coming back. The dishes are consistently delicious. They have excellent service. The ambiance is comfortable, casual and chill, with small neighborhood vibe. Chef Tony and team offers creative nightly specials based on what's fresh locally that day. A sign of true passion for creativity, offering the freshest ingredients to diners, and providing support for local purveyors.The dishes:-Duck liver pate - rich and luscious pate smeared on toasted crostone, topped with kumquat marmalade served with a side of wild arugula.-Dungeness crab with squid ink linguine (special of the night) - fresh house made squid ink linguine prepared al dente, topped with a generous portion of fresh chunks of Dungeness crab meat served in a light cream sauce.-Imperial Wagyu flat iron steak - perfectly prepared tender Wagyu served with a delicious Black Trumpet mushroom jus, accompanied with asparagus and Mokum carrots.-Chocolate Budino - perfectly sweetened, served with hazelnuts, sea salt, Chantilly cream, and biscotti.Thank you Chef Tony and team for another impeccable experience.See y'all next time. :)\", \"Everything tasted amazing - zero complaints about the food and service!- garlic Parmesan focaccia (they mill their flour in house)- squid ink pasta special with Dungeness crab (my favorite item, would get again. Loved the the texture of the pasta and the flavor was so well balanced)- winter citrus salad (they use seasonal produce and it's easy to tell! They made use of a mandoquat fruit hybrid and it was great)- panna cotta (more mandoquat in action, again not complaining)Would definitely go back for other items.\", \"Another superb experience here.First of all, our waitress KimThi was such a pleasure. Such a sweet, good humored person, and friendly yet efficient. All the other staff who brought our dishes were really friendly too! Just adds that extra cozy something to an already wonderful meal.Second of all, our meal felt so elegantly creative without being pretentious. The yellowtail appetizer special looked and tasted like Spring, with bright, green, and early springtime flavors. The kumquat marmalade on the duck pate appetizer was so unique (the flavors together weren't quite a match for my personal taste, but I enjoyed them separately and my dining companion loved the combination). Finally, the pastas were a delight: the tortelli felt decadent but nuanced, without being cloyingly rich, and we were lucky to be there when there was a pasta special topped with plenty of sweet Dungeness crab. It seems like this restaurant really likes to incorporate seasonal ingredients without making a big fuss about it. Anyways, this was a hit, we will be back, and we highly recommend!\", \"I haven't left a review for Seven Hills? Shame on me. This is my favorite restaurant of all time!! I ordered nothing but the specials - all three, each time. The yellowtail, truffle pasta, squid ink crab. Wine list - so much to choose from.\", 'Fabulous Experience in this restaurant in Russian Hill! Came for a team business meal and everyone was super impressed with their meals. Every pasta was above expectations - particularly the the truffle tortelloni. I tried a little bit of everything in their menu. The crab ink pasta and truffle pasta special were to die for. Their pate crostini and salad were very packed in flavour. The desserts were excellent - taking my hat off for their panna cotta. Delicious! Service was impeccable and the ambiance was pretty modern Italian. Fresh and delicious - will come back !', 'Really enjoyed our dining experience here. Came to celebrate a birthday. We were seated in the main area. Lighting was dimmed a bit to set a more intimate mood. We shared everything we ordered. Started with the snap pea salad and duck liver pate. Salad was fresh and the duck liver pate was earthy but offset by the sweetness of the strawberry jam.For our mains, we ordered the fusilli and the wagyu beef. The sauce on the fusilli was rich but not too thick. The beef was very tender and served with potatoes and mushrooms. Our two desserts were both very good, but preferred the bread pudding over the panna cotta.Highly recommend reservations.', 'The food was fantastic. We started with  a meatball appetizer. Then we split three entrees family style. The service was fantastic. A real neighborhood  gem.', 'Fantastic and authentic Italian food. After making a reservation for our hotel, we always make a resy at Seven Hills.  Alexis and his team do a wonderful job.  Everyone is professional and nice.  Food is superb and wine selections are fantastic.  Hmmm, I think we need to plan our next trip to SF!', \"It's a very nice dining experience for a birthday celebration~ The duck liver was very flavorful and our favorite dish. The ingredients in the prosciutto salad work well together. The pork chop had good flavor but we would recommend well-done instead of medium. Overall the service and ambiance were pleasant too. Will come back~\", \"I've tried a lot of Italian places in the city, and this easily takes the cake. My friend and I walked in on a Saturday night with no reservation and got sat down immediately. The ambiance is cozy, intimate--truly the perfect place to wind down. We started off with the herb focaccia and duck liver pate. The focaccia was extremely fragrant, and truly enhanced the complimentary olive oil. The delightful candied kumquat cut through the duck liver pâté, a flavor combo I really wasn't expecting. This antipasti was crunchy, creamy, sweet, and bitter from the arugula-frisée mix. I would definitely recommend.For our entrees, my friend and I split the Fussili Lunghi and Pappardelle. You can tell that the pasta is extremely fresh as every bite had a bounce to it. The sauce of each dish was seasoned incredibly well and I left feeling very satisfied. On top of all the amazing food, our waitress Kim really took care of us and was so attentive to our needs. Her service was the cherry on top.I'll definitely be recommending this place to all my friends.\", \"This place is outstanding! I had been wanting to go for years but kept getting turned away for not having a reservation. My friend is moving after passing the bar so you know we had to celebrate! We had an 8:40 PM reservation and started off with the focaccia. It's so worth it! Perfectly crispy and soft. We shared a bottle of wine and the two special pastas the crab fettuccine and the truffle ricotta. They were not shy with the truffles and shaved fresh truffle from a box with the truffles in salt. Absolutely divine. We opted for dessert too because how many times do you pass the bar? We shared the persimmon dessert as well with a side of Chantilly cream. It wasn't overly crowded and the service was nice! We were being slow and taking our team. We were the last to leave the restaurant but everyone was really gracious about it. I highly recommend this spot for a celebration or romantic dinner.\", \"Seven Hills. I had heard those two words from many a friend over the past few months and I finally was able to get reservations, for my birthday no less! We trundled out on a rainy Monday night in San Francisco and got seated for our 8 pm reservations indoors. The restaurant was in a sleepier part of Russian Hill and surprisingly, there was no issue finding parking at all for us. We rushed into the restaurant to get out of the rain and got comfortable.Food review:Garlic & Parmesan Focaccia 5/5 - Yes. Yes. Yes. Three yeses. The focaccia had the most amazing texture with the parmesan creating a nice, crisp layer on top. What was so wonderful about this app was that the dough was seemingly made with whole grain or some other type of flour, not white flour. It gave it that much more bite. Get this no matter what!Tomato Braised Polpette 4.75/5 - There's something so classic about red sauce and meatballs. This dish takes that to a whole new level, with the sauce itself providing umami and pops of acidity throughout the whole dish. Spectacular. The only thing I would've wanted a bit more of is more of a prominent, deeper flavor in the tomato sauce but otherwise, sooooo good.Tagliolini all'Amatriciana 5/5 - Yummmmm. Oh my goodness the noodles were cooked the PERFECT al dente here. The bits of pancetta mixed in with the sauce provided little surprises here and there. It was such a nice dish - loved every second of it.Tagliatelle Pork Rib Sugo 5/5 - This was my favorite item of the night and I cleaned it up. The pork rib sugo was just mindblowing in flavor. The strands of pork rib meat between the al dente noodles were so good. The width of the noodles were a perfect vehicle for the sauce to rest on when taking bites of the dish. 1000% get this if you see it on the daily menu.Okay, okay this place absolutely lives up to the hype. For all the friends that were talking about this place, now there's one more friend talking about this place - me! Go please, you won't regret it!\", \"We loved our dinner here! Food was so tasty and service was wonderful! Pasta is made fresh daily, and all the ingredients seemed fresh and of quality.We ordered:-garlic focaccia: crispy yet fluffy, buttery and flavorful-beef corpaccio: tender and refreshing -beet avo salad: nice to get some greens in to balance all the carbs! loved the textures-truffle tortelloni: served with freshly shaved truffle! Tortelloni were filled with pockets of cheese and they were so yummy and fun to eat!-squid ink garlic lemon crab pasta: pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, with the harmonious combination of garlic and lemon made for such a scrumptious bite! That with the chunks of crab... *chefs kisses!*-sea bass: nothing to write home about, unfortunately...!Totally recommend all that we tried, except for the sea bass, which was a tad bit overcooked and didn't stand out really in any way. Our faves were of course the pasta dishes-- truffle tortelloni and the squid ink garlic lemon crab pasta! I believe those were the specials of the night; hoping they'll have it on their permanent menu soon!!\", \"Seven Hills is a farm to table Italian restaurant with lots of pasta and wine options. I came here last night for dinner- I recommend booking a table in advance, we called a few hours before dinner and they only had tables available outside. The heaters were pretty warm but I had to keep my coat on.The food was pretty tasty, we started with the garlic focaccia. It had a great garlic and cheese flavor and they gave enough for 5 people to share. I ordered the Maccheroncelli which a lot of yelp reviewers were saying was the best item- I thought it was pretty tasty, loved the ricotta cheese after mixing it all in, and it was heavy and I had a lot leftover. I wish there some meat or extra veggies though for the price ($26). I also tried the squid ink pasta with crab which was a special yesterday, and it was so tasty, lots of crab, and I was scraping the sauce from the plate. I did think the portion was a little small for how much it was ($38) but I guess it's what to expect from an upscale Italian restaurant! Overall good food and nice experience.\", 'The special yesterday was squid ink pasta with shrimp it was so delicious! Definitely recommend this place the quality is top tier and the restaurant has an upscale ambiance.']\n",

To me that is absolutely worthy of 5 stars.', \"California comfort cuisine done right could be the mantra of Starbelly. Located near the bustling intersection of 16th and Market Streets in the Castro neighborhood of San Francisco, Starbelly is the epitome of a neighborhood gem where locals congregate for their signature brunches on their highly regarded backyard patio, and people from out of town are familiar with their homespun yet still elevated takes on classic comfort food. I had been to Starbelly once before, as an invited guest of a special event that they were hosting showcasing the aforementioned back patio, now over a full decade later I was back mainly due to the fact that Starbelly was participating in San Francisco Restaurant Week in which local restaurants offer diners a prefix meal of three courses sold at an affordable price. This way, diners, both locals and out-of-towners can experience a popular restaurant without breaking the bank, and support a local establishment; making it a win-win for everyone! From my recollections, Starbelly has not participated in San Francisco Restaurant Week in quite some time, so when I saw that they were taking part in it this year, I jumped at the chance to entertain a group of diners and I one weeknight evening.Reservations were super easy to make via the Yelp app, and when I finally arrived, they were packed with customers, which only reiterated how popular they are with locals. Although their back patio is well regarded at Starbelly, being sat right next to the entrance at night with the cold air rushing through the open door wasn't the most ideal of situations. The menu at Starbelly is separated into sections including Snacks, Salads, Small (or Appetizers), Sides, Pizza, and Plates (or Entrées). Of course, we came for restaurant week and it provided all of these menu items sold at a more affordable price point as we were already dining on three courses. For my appetizer course, I ordered their Pumpkin Dumplings, which were served with brown butter, sage, pumpkin seeds and shaved garan. Others in my party ordered their Mix Chicories Salad which was topped with persimmon, pomegranate, pumpkin seeds and goat feta; and their House Made Chicken Liver Pâté, which was served with buttered bread, sweet onion marmalade and grain mustard. To start our meal, we shared their House Cut Fries which were served with three dips.For our entrées, I ordered their Grilled Bavette Steak, which was served with crispy plantains, nopales, and an heirloom tomato salad topped with a spicy peanut salsa matcha. Others in my party ordered their Sumac Seared Hawaiian Tombo Tuna, which was served with a white butter bean puree, grilled little gems and topped with a green olive salsa. For our dessert course, I ordered their Warm Toffee Cake which was served with a dollop of mascarpone and medjool dates. Others ordered their Salted Caramel Pot de Crème, which was served with cornmeal-rosemary cookies; and their Arborio Rice Pudding, which was served with brandy soaked cherries. Our food did take a while to come out, as it was very busy. The highlights were definitely the appetizer courses, as the Pumpkin Dumplings and Liver Pâté were not only excellently plated, but they were each lovingly crafted and we each could have had that dish as a main course and be satisfied. I really liked the spicy kick that my Bavette Steak had, but the Tombo Tuna was served a little too lukewarm for my fellow diners taste. The Toffee Cake was super sweet, and the rice pudding wasn't what my fellow diners expected it would taste like, so take that for what it's worth. Of particular note, they were gracious enough to take our Fries off of our final bill when we commented that they were all remnant pieces of potato, and not what we were expecting. The total bill for five diners was $256.62, after tax, but before gratuity was added in, which was reasonable, considering how many courses of food we enjoyed this evening. With the perfect meal for our large group, Starbelly has definitely become a local institution where diners can enjoy the comforts of home in an welcoming setting, and I for one am so glad they have thrived in the Castro neighborhood for so many years!\", 'The host, who is the first face you interact with, seemed to be very stressed. This made her seem unapproachable and she was a little rude when she finally engaged us. Other than that, the rest of the staff were great. This is a MICHELIN  restaurant. The corn pizza sounded delicious only on paper. Mehhhh! My favorite thing that I ate here was actually the LOCO MOCO! Highly recommend! Try to get reservations. This restaurant gets really busy and wait times can take a while. Luckily, we were able to be seated without any reservations. The outdoor patio was nice. The indoor seating looked a little crowded.', \"Starbelly in San Francisco's Castro neighborhood is a true gastronomic delight, meriting every one of its five stars. This charming spot combines a relaxed, inviting atmosphere with a culinary prowess that is hard to match. Their farm-to-table approach is evident in every dish, showcasing fresh, locally-sourced ingredients that burst with flavor. The standout for me was their house-made pizza, boasting a perfectly crisp crust and innovative toppings that were a harmonious blend of savory and fresh. Accompanied by their unique cocktail selections and attentive, friendly service, Starbelly creates an experience that is both delightfully sophisticated and comfortably casual. A must-visit for anyone looking for an exceptional dining experience in the Castro!\", \"Cute back patio space for groups looking for a light bites/tapas style dinner with crafty cocktails!Came through with some friends for dinner and drinks on a weekday. We made easy reservations via Yelp and didn't have to wait. Give yourself extra time to find parking if you're driving, as Starbelly is located in a 5-way intersection. We all got confused on which direction to walk. Surprisingly, we didn't have to wait and we didn't see anyone else in line when we rolled up. They're dog-friendly in their back patio, and it's not extremely spacious but can fit a few groups. No outdoor heaters, but it stayed pretty warm despite the cool and slightly windy weather.We went ham on ordering the dishes, started with their fries with 3 dip sampler, burrata with grilled peaches (such a summery delight!), thai basil sausage, crab burrata dumplings (#1 pick, but so sad it was over in one bite), grilled steak with peanut matcha dressing (holy smokes, this was the most special and definitely a favorite with the sweetness of plantains and grilled onions) and roasted corn cilantro pizza. The drinks were FIRE, and so well presented...check da photos. Food was def on point! Wish we could eat this good and with this much variation all the time.Be prepared to pay a pretty penny, definitely on the $$$'s list, and portion sizes aren't big at all. I would say their evening menu is more a tapas style vs big entree vibe. Regardless, we had such a fun night with great convo, professional service, and constant water-refills without having to flag our server down. Noise was a bit louder when all of the tables were full, as the patio tables are close together. But a quick peek indoors looked more romantic/chill with the dim lighting.The food runners were so great, smiley, and honestly way more involved with our table compared to our server. Shoutout to the guy who went the extra mile to get my pup a bowl of water! It means a lot. Starbelly is a great spot for groups and for diverse eaters who want to share and tapas it out.\", \"Consistently delicious and packed on a Tuesday night!We sat on high chairs and the tables wobble,  so the kind waiter helped make them stable.  There's also outdoor seating with heat lamps and more space in the back indoor patio.We had hummus and pita, corn pizza, mussels in tasty red sauce, Babette steak, Starbelly salad, gazpacho and ceviche.  I had a Passionflower drink.  My daughter had her favorite lavender lemonade.   Warm toffee cake and caramel pot de crème were delightful desserts to finish our meals.  Great location, good vibes, Lively SF crowd with friendly and professional service.  What more could I want?\", 'Really cute vibe great for a date spot! Have an awesome back patio with twinkly lights.Really good happy hour, the waitstaff was super friendly.Definitely would come back here dinner next time!', 'Got to know about this place because my partner got a gift card for Starbelly. We chose to be seated at the back patio- it looked amazing. Has a few vegetarian options , I got the mushroom pizza which was good. Lot of cocktail options, we got 3 , they tasted good but watered down. Overall happy with the service .', \"Always a good time here! Family friendly, good food.RESERVATIONSMade online about a month in advance for a group of 8, inadvertently for pride weekend but that ended up being fun!

Really good, refreshing, citrusy.* Chumbo Picante ($14) - 3.5 stars. Tasty, love the egg white texture, but a little strong for me (granted I'm a lightweight).THE FOOD* Loco Moco ($16) - 4 stars. I enjoyed the flavors; I haven't seen many loco mocos on menus in SF!* Fried Chicken Po Boy ($14) - 4 stars. Meat was moist but bread was weakest link, soft & fell apart easily.* Margherita Pizza ($15) - 3.5 stars. Our table ordered two of these and we noticed a big inconsistency in the quality. The one I photographed was by far the better of the two, crust crisped just right. The second one we got was much more burnt and overly toasted, cheese overcooked.\", 'Came for happy hour with a friend and it was still easy to get seats before 6pm. We got happy hour fries and the corn pizza which is a must try! I love the ambiance - from the entrance to the patio. Although...they were trying to rush us out (asked to clear our plates 4-5x) after we had been there for an hour - I guess it was getting more packed, but we were still munching on our fries!', \"I've been to Starbelly a handful of times, and each time, I walk away with a happy belly. The Mussels with chorizo are simply delicious, and I'm officially addicted.I've received good service, even when the restaurant is busy, so I'm giving them high marks for that.\", \"Got a round of cocktails and some pizzas. Where pretty decent. The corn pizza especially was nice. The other pizza we got was a bit floppy and the toppings didn't really hold on. The apps were quite good though! The liver pâté was sublime.\", 'We had a splendid time there. Everyone thought the space was very cute and intimate and it was a perfect size for our office party. We booked the back patio for our holiday party. The food was delicious and plentiful. Everyone was raving about the quality of the food - we even had leftover pizzas to take home! The pacing of the food being brought out was perfect. Everything was timed very well. They allowed us to do our white elephant gift exchange and were pretty accommodating of us being a little bit rowdy and also ending a little bit over the time limit. Overall 5/5', \"Starbelly, located in San Francisco's Castro neighborhood, is a culinary gem deserving of its five stars. This inviting spot showcases an impressive culinary skillset and a commitment to using fresh, locally-sourced ingredients. Their homemade pizza, with a crispy crust and innovative toppings, stood out as a perfect balance of flavors. The exceptional cocktail selections and friendly service elevate the dining experience at Starbelly. For an exceptional dining experience in the Castro, don't miss out on Starbelly!\", \"I have only good things to say about this place!The menu has traditional American dishes like pizzas and burgers, and they also offer a great selection of cocktails to accompany your meal. We started with some appetizers - the first we got was the chicken liver pate, which came with bread and 3 delicious spreads. At some point we ran out of bread and still had leftover spreads, and they were kind enough to just give us extra bread without any charge. They really figured their pizzas out! We got the margherita pizza as well as the star belly bacon pizza, and they were both fantastic choices. What really sold me was the crust, it was just the right thickness and crunch - it may just be my own personal preference - and honestly this was some of the best pizza I've had in SF which I was not expecting at all. The star belly bacon pizza was really good - I thought I would take issue with the amount of arugula they put on top of the pizza but it ended up being the perfect amount! The cocktails are also great and the menu offers a wide variety. We were seated in this kind of outdoor area which had excellent natural lighting and great greenery/decor. Even though the place was kind of full, we were able to get all of our dishes pretty quickly which is a huge plus. Especially with the drinks it was no more than a 5 minute wait from ordering to having the drink in my hand. Their regular entrees are probably really good, but if you are going with a group I would recommend going with the pizzas because of the taste and the low cost (though everything on the menu was pretty reasonably priced).\", \"Lovely brunch in Castro. Food: 4 Service: 3 Atmosphere: 5Cost to worth it rating: 4 (entrees $12-16 and large)Opentableable: no but Yelp Return worthiness: yesHighlights:- Outdoor patio out back: nice covered space with a fun vibe - Chilaquiles: big pile of red sauced chips with homemade chorizo that wasn't greasy or too spicy. Bonus for the entire half of avocado and side salad. 4.5 stars- Chicken and waffle: 2 waffles and large fried chicken pieces stacked. Very tasty. 4 stars - Fun drinks: not just standards. I got a strawberry infused vodka spritz and a lychee prosecco one.- Cornbread: good form texture, slightly sweet, and grilled on the edges. Only nit is it said jalapeño cornbread and didn't have jalapeños in it like I had seen pictured. 4 stars - Water: give you a large wine bottle full so you can keep hydrated.- Seating options: also indoor table, high tops by the bar, and parklet outside.Lowlights:- Busy so hard to get the attention of our waitress when needed. - Yelp reservation: love that you can reserve for brunch, but didn't have an indication of where to be seated, but when we got there it said parklet. That would've been ok but it was so windy and was excited they had space out back. Fully enjoyed our delicious and fun brunch here and would be happy ti return.\", \"It's been a while since I've last visited Starbelly and so I decided to stop by during restaurant week for their amazing $15 lunch deal! Turns out however that the deal was only for M-F, but we figured we'd give the brunch menu a try since we were already here. The menu is rather small but has a good variety of items including egg dishes, pizzas, fried chicken sandwich, etc. There was also a drinks list with some tasty sounding cocktails that were pretty affordable compared to other spots, though we did not try any this time. We ended up trying the asparagus pizza, asparagus and spring onion soup, and fries. The pizza was definitely large enough to feed two people with moderate appetites and I liked the more subtle flavors paired with the salty meat. My favorite part was the crust which was thin and crispy! Only gripe would be the amount of oil, there were a few times when the oil would spill into my hand while eating it - with that said, the oil did add good flavor. The soup was nice and creamy without being too heavy - I liked that it wasn't overly salted and really let the asparagus shine. The fries could have been a bit more crisp for my liking - they're reminiscent of in-n-out fries. Service was prompt and friendly and I love the beautiful space here - the patio is also dog friendly!!\", \"I've eaten here several times and the food is consistently good. The service isn't as attentive as expected.\", \"We came by for brunch the other day and were shocked by how good their seasonal dishes were for spring. It's asparagus and scallion season, and Starbelly really delivered in our last visit. Normally, I would not be super thrilled for an Asparagus and Spring Onion Soup, but it was so flavorful and highlighted the ingredients perfectly. If my picky childhood self had tried this growing up, I would've come to love asparagus much sooner.We also ordered the Asparagus Pizza, which was refreshing and decadent at the same time. The green sauce (which I'm guessing is a pesto made with asparagus?) added a fresh element that was balanced well with the cheese and prosciutto toppings. But if it's not decadent enough, I recommend trying the House Cut Fries, which somehow taste and look like In-N-Out fries. Unsure if they're making it the exact same way or what magic they're working, but the fries are also amazing.Lastly, we really appreciated how accommodating and kind they were for our dog! We'll be back again to try their next seasonal menu.\", 'Starbelly was an ideal spot for a cocktail lunch amidst a day of errands. The relaxed ambiance and welcoming staff provided a nice break for the hustle, and their diverse cocktail selection added a delightful touch to the meal. The food options were equally impressive, offering a flavorful range that catered to various tastes. The convenience of its location on Market made it a standout choice for a satisfying and enjoyable midday pause.', \"I'm here for the beautiful cocktails, easy atmosphere, minimal lines for weekday brunch, the amazing blonde waitress that made our day and simple California-style menu :-)Perfect place for catch up time with your friends, beautiful outdoor covered area / sunroom. Just gives you a happy feel good vibe and their menu served perfect portions for a table for 2\", 'Cutest place, sat outside in the back and the heaters are abundant, so you will not get cold. Ordered micheladas and a couple other cocktails and all were great. The food is on point, every single thing was so yummy. We ordered the Starbelly bacon pizza, the green goddess sauce on it is a game changer, so good. The other item you must order is the chicken and French toast, everyone at the table tried it and loved it. The service was fantastic!', \"Walked in for an early dinner for 1 and was seated outside my my two dogs. They brought water for me and the dogs right away very sweet. Then I sat there for 15 minutes watching the employees chat with one another. When I left I walked by 4 different employees no one said a word to me. So disappointing as I've had great food here before but lack luster service at best\", \"It was a lovely welcome to SF/restaurant week dinner at Starbelly! I was brought by a friend and didn't expect too much since I was mostly there to catch up with my friend and it seems like a casual spot at first glance but then saw the Michelin sticker.  Isn't it great when your friends get you? Then was delightfully surprised to see it was restaurant week! For $45 I got the chicken liver, the Babette steak and the pot de creme,  great deal! The chicken liver paired perfectly with the jam and mustard but what took it over the top was the bread (which I usually avoid).  It looked like it was toasted with butter which is always a yes for me.  But discovered that it was just that moist! (sourdough?) Ah, love the SF bread game! The Babette steak was the winner for me! The meat was so perfectly tender, the fresh vegetables so flavorful, the texture and sweetness of the platano a perfect complement to the steak and the sprinkling of peanuts took it to the next level!\", \"Starbelly is a neighborhood gem that needs to be a part of everyone's regular rotation. It's a great option for a weeknight burger and fries, but the star for me is when you have a weeknight pizza craving. The bacon pizza is so scrumptious. The crispy crust with melty cheese and crisp bacon is a combo to salivate over. The arugula adds a nice peppery touch. This specific night I decided to try the Toffee Cake, and added a scoop of the seasonal ice cream, which was the Chocolate Caramel Crackle--the two together was AMAZING. I'm going back just for that dessert combo.\", \"I love Starbelly! I've been for both brunch and dinner and the food is always amazing, and they take reservations which is a huge plus and perfect for groups! The indoor seating is nice, but I really love the back patio area. I'll definitely be back!\", \"I had a really great brunch here. They have a cool outdoor patio seating I tried the Italian eggs, which were very flavorful. Also got the French toast, which is very tasty. Didn't try the drinks this time. I'd love to come back for dinner to try their entrées, however, overall a really solid brunch spot. Service was good. Would definitely recommend!\", \"One of my favorite places in San Francisco to have delicious & beautiful food with wonderful cocktails. My go to is the house made pate - decadent, white bean dip - beautiful, fries with 3 dips - LOVE (goes so well with a martini) and wonderful Starbelly salad. Although the pizzas are phenomenal there too.The service is on point- upbeat, and very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu.Had the newest cocktail -Passionflower: tequila and passion fruit. I tend to order a vodka martini, but this sounded so amazing.! And it was so yummy. I'll add more to my review the next time I go. I just go so often that, silly me, forgot to give them the a great review ;)\", \"Made reservations for Wednesday brunch at 11:30, upon arriving we were seated promptly. Inside of the restaurant was pretty vacant but the patio in the back was full.

Speaking of the food, they have basic dishes. The quality is ok, not something very outstanding but you can easily enjoy. The ambiance is nice and the service is pretty fast and efficient.', \"Went around 11:30 am on Sunday and ordered the chicken and waffles here for the second time and they're still as good as I remembered them to be. The portion size, presentation, chicken to waffle to ratio is perfect for me. The chilaquiles was also delicious but I'm not sure if it's worth the price. It's such a cute place.

The space has a really nice dimmed lighting, creating a great intimate space for small groups. Ordered the broccoli rapini, flavor was great but a bit salty and extremely oily. Asked for half vegan cheese on the pizza and they accommodated! It was really good, crispy and thin crust just how I like it! Managed to finish all of it with 2 people.

The drinks are tasty. The appetizers aren't too heavy where you still have room for your main dish. I tried the spring rolls and they were crispy and still moist inside. You will not go hungry with your main dish. Loved the fired garlic in the garlic noodles, and the chicken is nicely grilled. The banh mi sandwiches are massive and filled to the brim. Definitely try this restaurant.\", \"It felt more like a sampling menu. $65pp for the set dinner but there isn't a whole lot of food. I understand when you come to a place like this, it's more about the trendy bar Asian fusion vibe. Everything was good from the beef carpaccio to the duck spring rolls to the fried catfish. I really enjoyed the pho spice cocktail!! And coffee cream brûlée was a delicious treat at the end. It does get really loud here due to the layout of the restaurant. You've also got the open kitchen right there to add to the mix. They're very popular so by 6:30, it's really crowded. If you come early, you shouldn't have a problem getting seated. Dishes take a little while to come out but service was quite friendly, as expected at places like this. I think I prefer more cozy places so there's a certain vibe you'd be looking for when you come to Lily's. I don't think I quite got my money's worth, hence 3 stars overall\", 'Delicious food! I had been waiting to check this place out. Came with some friends on a Sunday, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. We ordered the garlic noodles with steak, duck egg rolls, and mussels in curry sauce with ramen noodles. All three dishes were super tasty. The beef in the garlic noodles was cooked perfectly, melting in your mouth. The duck egg rolls were very tender with the crispy outside perfectly complimenting the stuffing. The mussels were good too, but a bit difficult to eat as a shared dish. I also got a side of their hot sauce which comes in a little jar that I was able to take home. The restaurant has a really nice decor and ambience, and we sat at the chefs table where we could see them make the meal. Highly recommend this place!', \"We came here on a Sunday night for dinner with no reservations but were able to get table seating. We ordered two appetizers and garlic noodles, but the appetizers were huge. For two people, we were both pretty content after the appetizers. We ordered:*beef carpaccio: also came with bone marrow and a large sesame cracker. This dish was so flavorful. *bo luc lac salad*garlic noodles with surf and turf: it was the same filet mignon as the bo luc lac salad. We took it to go as we couldn't finish it after the first two dishes.For drinks, we tried the strawberry daquiri and preserved lime blended margarita. The strawberry daquiri just tasted like a strawberry yogurt. The margarita was very salted plum forward. Will definitely be back to try other menu items.\", \"The first picture Yelp shows of Lily is its door. What a pretty door! It's a medium sized restaurant, and the seating is parallel to its bar/kitchen. The chef's dog, Bo, stands guard at the front of the restaurant and very relaxed and polite-- what a good boy.They take reservations via Resy, but they had plenty of empty tables when I dined on a Sunday lunch. The interior climate of the restaurant was damp as the ventilation was poor, with some moist and muggy pockets of air hitting you every so often. Service was decent, and the food came out pretty quickly.I tried the lunch set menu which includes a beverage, appetizer, and entree. What saddens me about Lily is that it aims to be elevated Vietnamese food, which comes with the glitz and the price tag, but the flavor? For every item that came to our table, we'd have the same descriptor: mild. It tasted like the essence of a dish rather than an actual dish. The only strong item was the Vietnamese Iced Coffee.\", \"We came in on a Sunday night without reservations, not knowing it was restaurant week, and had less than 15 min wait. The RW menu was $65, and was great selection and value for a special occasion For the first course, we tried the beef carpaccio, pho, and the duck rolls. The highlight of the three was the beef carpaccio, which had incredible balance of flavor in the light marinade/dressing, with an umami boost of fish sauce and much needed citrus to cut the fat from the bone marrow on the side. The sesame crackers offer great texture contrast. The other two dishes had great attention to flavor balance as well, just less extreme flavor rangeFor the second course, we tried the Hanoi bbq pork, turmeric fried catfish, and I believe an oxtail dish. The bbq pork and catfish dishes came with lots of Banh Hoi type materials, like lettuce, herbs, dipping sauces. They also came with rice paper, and I think our server recommended we just fold the food into them and dip before eating - I'm not sure that this is recommended, I think more typical may be to moisten the whole rice paper sheet before filling. People can eat it however they want, but offering some instruction either from staff or on the menu could be helpful here, since dealing with the rice paper isn't intuitive to all. I think moistening the rice paper entirely has a more pleasant texture. The Banh Hoi woven vermicelli noodles themselves are a marvel, cut to be just the right size for the rice paper, with a nice smoky garlic flavor, and satisfying springy texture. The catfish was spectacular, arrived sizzling and lightly crispy, and had a nice bed of fried onions to catch residual flavor.The banana pudding was excellent, with nice moist texture, and great temperature contrast with the ice cream. The tapioca pudding has a lot going on, but had a nice flavor balance.\", 'Loved santel our service provider who was warm and went above and beyond to make sure we understood the menu from start to finish. So for that we will def be coming back.The bone marrow was exceptional.  All the flavors harmonized and the herbs really made this dish sang.  Highly recommend. Bun rieu was very creative and had luscious flavors.  Though being Vietnamese I still felt it could use more tomato flavorPork chop was very high quality and was a generous portion. Something I always appreciate.  Will be back for many reasons but perhaps it was the service that made the experience memorable', \"Clement Street is so much fun with lots of varieties of cuisines to eat.  I highly recommend Lily, if you enjoy Vietnamese food with Californian flair, very friendly staff, and a warm comfortable setting.  I had the lunch special ($32pp) of fried fish and noodles, which had fresh dill.  The mango salad was spicy and refreshing.  Portions are large, beautifully presented, and seasoned perfectly.  There's a super friendly guy who works here and I'm sure people would return, not only for the great experience, but to see him again!\", 'Beautiful space and ambience with a unique and fun menu. The jackfruit \"pizza\" appetizer has a flat crispy rice paper crust and topped with jackfruit, veggies, and herbs - pretty and delicious! I ordered the special crab noodle soup, and I especially enjoyed the glass noodles and various crab - be warned the portion is huge so you will definitely have leftovers.', \"Loved this place! Always walked past it on clement but finally got around to trying it out. It's a more upscale viet food restaurant and the food was so well done! We enjoyed everything we got, and the portions were huge. The staff is so kind and personable, will definitely be back!\", \"One of my oldest friends live in this part of neighborhood. I used to belong to some running clubs that took me to this part of town. When the pandemic hit this just seems too far to travel to - however my son fences in Mteam and there are lots of time to kill in the burbs of SF, All that is to say - I stumbled into this eating establishment by accident on my way to sushi. I called my friend to see if she was available to hang out and dine with me. My friend said this place has been open for three years. The place seems to have hopping ahead of a three day weekend. We did not make a reservation but found a table relatively easily. She said this is on some list and was glad we made it in! Atmosphere is pleasant. Good portion. Seems to be a cross between Vietnamese and French. Shaken beef salad is very good. 1/5 of daily protein by the look of it. We don't eat enough protein at home so I said how about filet and scallops? This is the most expensive thing on the menu. Figure it is worth sharing. To my surprise, it also comes with baguette, rice, sunny side up egg on top of rice, cheese, and pate. A very rich, satisfying, east meets west kind of dish. More for an impressive date than to dine with your kids. Might be a bit too adventurous especially with the cheese and pate.Recently I have been missing Saigon. This restaurant scratched that itch for southeast Asian countries. A date worthy restaurant for this part of town. I hope my friend and her husband would come here on a date some time -  now that we have been here.\", \"Wow, just wow. This place blew me away. The space is absolutely gorgeous, servers were attentive and helpful. And it seems like the staff love what they do. Everyone in my party ordered from the lunch special menu. I had the duck confit spring rolls and the roast beef pho dip sandwich. The sandwich was enormous and I had to take the rest home to finish it for dinner. The beef was well seasoned and the dip made the whole experience better.  My friend had the spicy mango and rice paper salad and she was very happy with it. And my mom had the bbq heritage pork noodle bowl. She loved the noodle bowl and allowed us to try some of it. The duck confit spring rolls were extra crunchy, but were a little on the salty side for my taste. All in all, run, don't walk, to check this place out!\", \"Run, don't walk.Or maybe walk quickly since there's only two days left for SF Restaurant week's promotion.  I came here today on a whim, wanting to catch up with the chef who I often bump into at the Ferry farmer's market.  Getting here around 12:15 pm on a Friday afternoon, I found most tables were occupied and, dining solo, I chose to sit at a counter seat.  Sarah greeted and seated me after bumping into chef Rob outside.  After weighing the various options, drink, appetizer, and main, I ordered my meal.  Sarah helped me in deciding on my main.  The restaurant week promotion is $30 for your choice of beverage, appetizer, and main (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=a1y8iDhD72wwMddxFqc6Ww&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q).Here's what I tried:Drink1. Saigon iced tea (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=HTlt3UIc0VlnGX9gtelxSw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Lemongrass, lychee, goji berry, yuzu honey, and mint.  I picked this since the other non alcoholic drinks had yogurt likely making them on the creamy side.  This was refreshing and not too sweet.  Be sure to stir from the bottom.Appetizer2. Ginger chicken noodle soup (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=tf5RKUtVkS6Rnd1_S94rRQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Poached breast and thigh, Thai basil, and bean sprouts.  The surprise ingredient here were the cruller (fried dough pieces mostly accompanying porridge) which gave this a crunch element.  I commented to Sarah this is an elevated mom's chicken soup.Main3. Roast beef pho dip sandwich, $5 supplement (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=y-97xkg1Q7ndJnRrT8ts6A&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Five spice roasted beef, pate, shallot aioli, and pho au jus.  I've had this before and it was as good as remember with the portions larger than I remember.  I only finished half of the sandwich and 'jus'/broth with a few bites of the salad.  The rest went home for a future weekend meal.Bonus, comped by the generous chef4. Spicy orange and rice paper salad (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=cR_ZtT7NA_oLaWAAX3dV9Q&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Brokaw avocado, tomato sambal, and Nuoc Cham.  The chef brought this out like an amuse bouche mentioning the growers' names along with the ingredients (cara cara oranges and watercress).  I jokingly asked him to write it down so I could Yelp it.  I later looked at my menu photo in identifying this dish.  Get this.  If you like spicy, yes I mean spicy, and refreshing sweetness, you'll love this.  Was tempted to face plant the bowl to catch every last drop of the sauces.There were three other diners on the front counter with me but we were well socially distanced.  As I finished my meal, a flow of diners entered and were seated including a large table towards the back.  I didn't get an opportunity to catch up with him given the crowd.  I, in passing, kidded him that I liked it better when I was dining alone for lunch, during the pandemic peak.  I deliberately posted this now to share this with interested eaters who would like to try this meal as there's only two days left in restaurant week.  Just go!\", \"This place is simply lovely. The drinks-dangerous. Perfectly sweet and addicting. We ordered the jackfruit pizza-imagine salsa and chips but even better. A great balance of sweet and salty. Definitely get it. The Hanoi BBQ Heritage Pork was so good! I love the array of textures from the lettuce, perilla, noodles, rice paper, and seasoned pork. Overall an amazing meal. I'm sad we didn't have room for dessert, but that just means we will have to visit soon. Thank you to CJ for your excellent service and recommendations. Our girl dinner was made better because of you!\", \"I came for restaurant week which was $40pp for a drink, app, and entree. The ambiance inside is lovely with beautiful decor and tentative service but the food was a bit lacking. The broth for both the appetizer pho and the dipping portion of the sandwich lacked a depth of flavor and almost had a burnt taste to it.  I would not have compared it to a pho broth at all upon taste. The sandwich was very hearty as it's loaded with beef but since the broth was a let down the sandwich ended up being very dry. I wished for something like pickled vegetables on the side to cut the monotony of just eating a beef sandwich.\", \"Their lunch special is a really good deal. I got a really great salted egg viet iced coffee, some duck eggrolls, and a turmeric fish bowl. The portions were generous and everything was great. I've mostly only had that fish dish as a big family style thing and this was more of an individual vermicelli bowl. It works pretty well as a personal portion and I think more places should do it. I definitely want to come back here for dinner. I think they do a great job of mixing traditional flavors with a little California. Big fan.\", \"Quick overview: I got to try Lily for the first time during SF restaurant week, and it was an absolute delight. Their $30 set lunch menu, which included a beverage, appetizer, and entree, was a great value. Not only was the meal incredibly satisfying, but I also had leftovers to bring home. If you are looking for a delightful blend of Vietnamese fusion cuisine, try Lily. I'll definitely return to try their other items.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~More detailed review:7/10 for the environment: The restaurant has an impressively long layout. However, the lack of windows can create a progressively dimmer ambiance as you go deeper into the restaurant.9/10 for customer service: The server had exceptional hospitality and kindly shared their recommendations. They were attentive throughout our meal, checking on us periodically to ensure we were doing ok. They accommodated our request to split the bill between the 7 of us, a rare occurrence in restaurants since splitting is often limited to just two cards.8/10 for food: Everything I had from the Sf restaurant week menu was delicious!What I ordered:*Rodriguez Farms Strawberry Sinh To (beverage): This tasted very similar to strawberry milk, and they put actual pop rocks in there.*Spicy Orange and Rice Paper Salad (appetizer): This salad has a slight kick, and the avocado is an interesting mix.*Tumeric Fried Catfish Banh Mi Sandwich (Entree): This was my favorite, I love how crispy the fried catfish was, and it went so well with the dipping sauce. The portion was huge and I had to pack the second half of the sandwich to bring home.\", 'Went here for SF Restaurant Week with two other friends! I was scouring the reservation website for a good two days straight and was able to get a table reservation at prime time 6pm dinner! It was $65 per person and I left full! The appetizer of beef and bone marrow was delish!!! Highly recommend! The coffee crème brûlée was extraordinary as well!!', 'Amazing place located in the multiethnic area of Richmond. Beautifully decorated space with elevated Vietnamese dishes. We tried the lunch special which included a special drink, appetizer/salad, and main dish. Generous portions!  The dishes are freshly prepared and dressed.  I especially loved the the chow fun noodles with tofu! Highly recommend this place if you are in SF', 'I\\'ve always been a little cautious about creative Asian cuisine but this place is brilliant. The decor was very cute with an open kitchen where you can watch the cooks working on the grill and wok. We loved everything we ordered but in particular the Jackfruit Pizza. The presentation was beautiful! Toppings include sweet jackfruit, microgreens, edible flowers, and some herby, tangy, creamy sauce. The rice paper was super crunchy and fun to eat. Highly recommend! We also liked the mango chicken salad. It came with plenty of mango chunks, chicken pieces, and avocado. The dressing was tangy and spicy. The rice paper mixed in added some fun texture. It\\'s totally a dish I\\'d like to eat every day. The chow fun came with rolled rice noodles, fried tofu, and a variety of veggies. The tofu was the star of the show to me, crispy on the outside, custardy on the inside. The dressing on the side had a pretty strong mustardy/wasabi taste. Last thing we had was the Pork Meatball \"Xiu Mai\". The concept of a deconstructed banh mi was interesting. And the presentation of meatballs simmered in tomato sauce, two gorgeously buttered milk bread, and a scoop of pate was also appealing. Very rich meaty flavors and generous portions. The mains are on the pricier side and come in larger servings so good to share among a few people. However, IMO their appetizers are definitely the best part of the menu.', 'I came here for restaurant week because the fixed menu looked really good. I got the Vietnamese coffee, beef noodle soup, and roast beef sandwich with soup dip. The Vietnamese coffee had a strong flavor which I like. Beef noodle soup had zero flavor at all. It was strange because it smelled really nice though. It threw me off.After that soup I knew I was going to regret my entree dish . The soup dip was the same flavorless soup, but the sandwich was good on its own.$40 pp for the meal was kind of disappointing. The service was great though and reservations were easy.', \"Came here for restaurant week!So Sunday mornings/afternoon is when inner Richmond farmers market takes place so it was impossible to park! Would just bus or Uber honestly bc we spent 20 mins finding parking and another 15 to walk. Wish they had let us known ahead but oh well! Prefix was 30 pp but our entrees were +5 each Got the prefix menu for restaurant week which lets u choose btw drink, app, entree Saigon ice: 3/5 the yuzu was settled in the bottom so make sure to mix well!Strawberry sin toh: 2/5 tastes like the children strawberry yogurt drink (danimals) hahaCalamari: 3.5/5 this was ok! Appreciated the fish sauce/Asian flavors but maybe a bit bland bc lack of enough sauce Chicken noodle soup: 4/5 this was a miniature pho dish basically and broth was pretty good with taste of chicken stock Broken rice: 5/5 generous portion and all the individual pieces tasted really good. The broth this dish came out in was the best bc it had a beef stock taste with rich flavors Pho dip: 3/5 wasn't my favorite a lot of meat and pate but maybe wasn't as spicy as I had hoped to balance those flavors. Also the dip thing maybe wasn't too much of a fan of but can see why others may like! Overall we paid around 46 after tax and tip which I think was a bit pricey but still had pretty generous portion sizes. Not sure if I may visit again but if I do excited to explore the dinner menu!\", \"Our family had a wonderful experience having an early lunch at Lily this weekend. Ambiance - the space was gorgeous and clean. You know what you are getting into going to Clement Street on a Saturday morning, but found a metered parking spot right in front. Lots of metered parking within 1 block, and some unmetered parking further out. Food - really great, beautiful, and nice takes on familiar and traditional dishes. I am partial, but Vietnamese food is pretty but Lily makes them gorgeous with flowers, garnishes, and other 'tweezer-work'. I also loved the banh mi, wings, an bun cha. Service - really deserves 6 stars. Extremely attentive, water glasses filled, clean plates and utensils changed between courses, etc. Front of house staff went out of their way to make our family feel welcome. I want to bring more people back here now! We'll be back.\", \"Lily is a great place to go to if you're looking for delicious, upscale Vietnamese food. I was able to go during Restaurant week and get the $30 deal which included an appetizer, drink, and main course. Overall felt like it was a pretty good deal especially for SF, and we'll definitely be back to try different things on the menu.Food wise: For appetizers, we got the calamari and ginger chicken soup. The calamari was spectacular and the chicken soup even better, perfectly balanced flavors! For drinks, we got the strawberry and lime sinh to, both of which were super tart and flavor-filled. I don't know that we'd get them again if we came, but as part of the deal they were great! The only thing I wasn't completely satisfied with was the Garlic Noodles - to be fair I do feel like my garlic tolerance level is extremely high (as in I consistently quadruple the amount of garlic needed for a recipe when cooking) - and I felt that there could've been a stronger garlic flavor. However, the dish was still tasty. My partner got one of the plates that cost an extra $5 (can't remember what it was called) and it came with a variety of grilled meats and rice. He enjoyed that immensely! The service was good - it's definitely a busy and crowded restaurant and I did see a lot of dishes getting delivered to the wrong tables. We were also seated about 15 min after our reservation time, but I think that can be attributed to the business of restaurant week.\", \"We were walking around and exploring the neighborhood and passed by Lily's. Menu looked good so we decided to come back for dinner when it opened. Dinner turned out to be fantastic! We ordered the Bun Cha Hanoi, Com Tam Suon Nuong and Cafe Sua Pot de Creme. And wow, it was a lot of food. The portions are, as other reviewers note, rather hefty. Mind you, the menu prices are a bit steeper than I'd expect but each dish was delicious and beautifully presented. For what we ordered we could easily have fed another person so either come very hungry, come as a group, or don't over order like we did. That said, everything was delicious and I highly recommend it!\", \"Very beautiful interior. Drinks are served with gorgeous flowers.Service was great, we were a party of 6 + my baby nephew and felt super comfortable.Food was yummy but not extraordinary, also very expensive for what it is. Glad we came, probably won't go back. So many other local gems to check out.\", 'We ordered a lot of food. Each plate portion is way bigger than we anticipated. We thought this was one of those schmuck tapas places but NOPE the portions are pretty hefty. Come come. Get catfish. So good. Comes with stuff. Oh wait my burger king is ready I gtg.  Edit: I got covid. 2/27/23. Which one of you went here to eat dinner and gave me covid that night?', \"A new favorite in the city! First and foremost, service is amazing. From the front staff to waiters and bartenders, everyone is so friendly and attentive. Chef Rob Lam was present that night. He checked in with all the guests and ensured that everyone was having a good time. There is a diverse selection of dishes and a decently sized selection of non-alcoholic drinks too! That night we opted for the spicy glazed chicken wings, fried prawns and sweet potato, and Hanoi BBQ Heritage pork. We also had the Vietnamese iced coffee and lychee strawberry sinh to. Every item was an explosion of rich flavor. If you're craving for Vietnamese and open to a unique and elevated experience, Lily is the place.\", \"Lily on Clement StreetInner RichmondSan Francisco, California Chef Rob Lam's warm effervescent personality pushed this one to a 5 star for me. His presence and desire to create a delicious and pleasing environment, could be felt throughout. I love it when a Chef will take the time to stop by and visit to chat about the food! Happy workers make happy servers in this upscale Vietnamese establishment and you're invited to join the party. It's rare to find a fancy Vietnamese place! Most of us are used to the usual pho and summer roll restaurants. Ever had jackfruit on pizza with nasturtiums or thick sliced Berkshire pork chops served with broken rice plus a pork hash casserole with egg or coconut charcoal infused truffle crepes? I have now!Beautifully presented food in a lively atmosphere. Expect to be pleasantly surprised. Large portions and a long list of alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks. Get the Pots de Creme for dessert! Double yum!Street parking available.\", \"I usually wouldn't pay Lily prices for a regular Vietnamese restaurant, but this was no regular restaurant. We went during restaurant week to try and honestly it might be one of my favourite restaurants in the city, food wise.The banana pudding might've been the best dessert we've had in a long time, but the cauliflower curry could've been better. I really liked the cauliflower curry personally, but my partner found it to be lacking in flavour. the chow fun was really good. There were people next to us eating the beef carpaccio, and it looked spectacular. The vibe definitely has Asian influences and the bar seating was really awesome because we were able to watch all the chefs make the food. One of the managers (maybe owner) came and dropped off food, and chatted with us, and it felt really personable.\", \"Behind a very unassuming entry is this amazing modern Vietnamese eatery with super tasty food!  Very creative menu - most items on it we haven't seen anywhere else!  We started with the Jackfruit pizza - no thick dough here, more like think chips at the bottom, and we're delighted with the interesting taste. The second appetizer we had was the steak salad - good size bowl with chunks of tender beef; very delicious. Our main course was the BBQ pork chop - huge dish with a lot of meat- the three of us couldn't finish even half of it. Our last course was the garlic noodles , again, big portion size here again. Service was attentive and on point; owner/chef Robert was busy working as well as socializing with customers.  And they packaged all the food we couldn't finish carefully and thoughtfully for us in individual paper containers. While most of the dishes were between $30-60, I think the value is great because they give you a lot of food!  And that, combined with the quality and taste, make them an impeccable 5-Star restaurant in my book!\", 'What a wonderful way to celebrate a birthday! Not only was the food unreal, the staff was professional and personable--chef Robert Lam himself came out to say hi with his cute puppy. The overall mood of the restaurant had the right balance of formality and home which is exactly my vibe. It was such an amazing experience and my husband and I are happy to think of this restaurant as a new addition to our list of SF favorites. Lily is another reason why we love our city.', 'I made a reservation for a party of 6 a few months in advance for brunch on a Saturday. The online reservation system was easy to use and seamless. On the day of our brunch, we were running a little late and they were able to accommodate a reservation at 12:00 PM rather than 11:30 AM which was nice. (Note: They open at 11:00 AM). The place did not get busy until 1-1:30 PM, so if you do plan on having a later brunch, do make a reservation. Each of us ordered from the prix fixe brunch menu which was a base price of $35/person. The prix fixe menu allows you to choose a drink, appetizer, and an entree. However, there are supplemental and add-ons which can easily hike the price of $35/person closer to $50-$60/person before tax. I got the coconut smoothie and added a shot of rum ($5 added for the coconut smoothie and an additional $7 to add alcohol to any drink), fried calamari, and the broken rice fish (com tam). My husband got the Saigon tea, papaya mango salad, and the BBQ heritage bowl. Coconut sinh to (3/5) - The presentation for this drink was great as it reminded me of Hawaii, but the drink itself was not remarkable. It tasted like bland coconut milk rather than a piña colada smoothie. Saigon tea (3/5) - We were hoping the yuzu flavor in the tea would pull through, but the drink was a bit too floral for our tasting. A plus about this drink is it\\'s not sweet, but do make sure to mix your drink thoroughly before drinking it or it gets syrupy on the bottom. Fried calamari (4/5) - Out of the 3 choices for appetizers on the menu, this was most likely the best choice. The calamari was lightly fried with some peppers. An aioli was drizzled on top of it. It was great, but just also a bit on the bland side even with the aioli topped on. Papaya mango salad (1/5) - We get that aesthetics are key in making and plating dishes, but this salad just had too many edible flowers and veered too far from what a salad should be. The papaya and mango are thinly sliced into thick 0.5\" strips rather than in matchsticks. Everyone in our party who ordered this dish ate around the flowers and was left with half a plate of flowers. The flowers were simply too overwhelming. The pomegranate was a nice touch, but again everything was buried in flowers making it hard to truly enjoy. Com tam (3/5) - The broken rice fish came with a great selection of protein from shrimp to chicken to pork. It also had a sunny side up fried egg present. Having some fish sauce on the side would be nice, but the protein for this dish was overly salty. Items were cooked well, but the flavoring was not to our palette. BBQ bowl (3/5) - This dish had banh hoi (rice noodles) and grilled pork. Pork was fine, but nothing surprised us about the dish. All in all, we felt this was on the pricey side, but of course it\\'s in SF so we knew right off the bat that we would be paying more. Presentation for the food was well executed, but the flavors were hard to follow through. We are glad we tried Lily restaurant. The service was amazing and our server was very approachable.', 'Came to try their $30 restaurant week lunch menu, made a 1:30 pm restaurant and was finally seated around 1:50pm. They were VERY busy but we seemed to be the only party that had to stand around and wait for a table to open up. Kind of left a bad taste in the mouth.The food was decently good! The strawberry sinh to was a nice creamy smoothie that satisfied my sweet cravings. My table tried all the appetizers, and I would pass on the salad. The pho and calamari were good though! For my entree I got the cha ca la vong fish noodle bowl and I really liked it. The fish was perfectly crispy and they really loaded the bowl with a LOT of fish. Overall, $30 restaurant week deal was well worth it for the yummy food and the huge portion sizes.', \"The Vietnamese cuisine served at Lily is contemporary and unique. We chose 3 appetizers and the day's special. Our server was friendly and enthusiastic, though I wish he'd warned us how generous the portions were. I think we would have been fine with two appetizers. What we ordered:- beef carpaccio - fried prawns and sweet potato - shaking filet of beef salad- pâté chaudThe beef carpaccio was a westernized version of traditional bo tai chanh. It was good, though our marrow bone didn't have much marrow in it.The fried prawns and sweet potato were a deconstructed version of banh tom co ngu. I liked how the prawns were fried out super crispy with the heads included. It was well seasoned and very good.The shaking beef salad was also a twist on bo luc lac. It was my husband's favorite dish that evening.The pate chaud was a puff pastry filled with duck and chicken liver pate, instead of ground pork. A unique take, though very rich. The ambiance is chic and trendy and it was bustling. We could tell that Lily is a very popular restaurant. FYI, though the food served is very good, it's much heavier than traditional Vietnamese cuisine and the the appetizers are entree-sized.\", \"Went to Lily for their SF Restaurant Week Lunch! We were able to get seated without reservation pretty quickly, but we did get there close to closing.I ordered the saigon iced tea, salt & pepper calamari, and cha ca la vong fish noodle bowl off their prix fixe menu.I felt like iced tea was pretty light, but still refreshing. The calamari was good, but not that memorable. The texture was more soft than crispy, like I usually expect. The noodle bowl was my favorite; the fish was really well cooked and was super flaky and the sauce was good. I also tried my friend's ginger chicken noodle soup and I thought the broth was really rich and flavorful.Lily offered a really interesting/modern twist to the Viet cuisine/restaurants I'm used to. It was honestly too nice compared to the Viet restaurants I frequent, so it was nice to try a different take!\", \"You'll need to make reservations for Lily online using their reservation booking website. There's option for table or bar. Restaurant is long and has fairly good seating, lots of reservation options the day or two prior to going but the table option filled up quickly! Came on MLK day and had the best time talking to the staff while waiting. Didn't catch the name but he was very funny/charismatic. Our waiter was very nice as well. Most staff that we spoke to was very nice. We ordered the jackfruit pizza appetizer and it was delicious. It was sweet a little sweet! It came with a scissor to cut pieces of the pizza. Lots of different but delicious looking appetizers to choose from! It was hard to just get one. Drinks: my friend ordered the Rodriguez Farms strawberry sinh toI had the kiwi cucumber crush. I must say it was a bit too sour for my taste  and wish I got a sweeter drink. For dinner my friends got:Garlic noodles with added chicken - very delicious, you can't go wrong with garlic noodles. Wok seared vegetarian chow fun - despite being my friends choice, I'd say this was actually my favorite dish of the night. Super flavorful, the tofu was delicious I couldn't get enough! When I took my first bite my eyes lit up with pleasant surprise and I secretly wished I ordered this one. I got the 2nd place beef noodle soup -pho Bo- despite it being 2nd place it was sooooo good. Very flavorful, the broth had a cinnamon taste that came out more than I've ever had in other pho. I like the added bread to dip in the soup and even had leftovers which taste just as good!\"]\n",

      "Reviews: ['The pasta and mushroom ravioli were outstanding. One of the yummiest aperol spritz! The ambience is cozy with blankets incase you get cold! Amazing service ! Highly recommend!', \"We came here around 8:30 pm on a Sunday night and they were so sweet and accommodating! There seating available inside and outside but we chose to sit outside. They had plenty of heaters available and even had blankets that you could use while you dine! For dinner we all got a little bit of everything and shared, family style. I'd highly recommend because everything was so good and you don't want to muss out! 10/10 experience!\", 'After my wife asked me to take her to a special place for her birthday, I knew the pressure was on. Found Roma Antica after speaking with some friends and it did not disappoint. The vibes are fantastic with \"warm\" inside seating as well as \"electric\" outside seating. Our waiter was extremely friendly and helpful in helping us decide what to order.In terms of food we ordered the Boscaiola with pink sauce, gnocchi w/ white, and calamari (not pictured). It was fantastic. Some of the best pasta we\\'ve tasted here in SF. Several other items were recommended to us by friends (cacio e pepe and coda alla vacciinara) so don\\'t think there is a way to go wrong. The calamari was just okay for me (a bit too chewy). Will certainly be coming back and not just for a birthday!', \"What a gem. One of my favorite Italian spots in the Bay. Authentic, delicious Italian cuisine. Had the friendliest, best service ever. Food was fantastic all-around. Nice casual, fun vibe.First off you're greeted by just a great, jovial staff. They're on top of things and seem to really care for you. I appreciated that my server was actually from Italy (and he joked about his strong accent). Feels like a fun atmosphere, with good food and good energy.We're first served with the fantastic house focaccia, so soft and with fresh rosemary. Delicious, and we had to stop ourselves from eating too much.For apps, we got the Burrata alla Caprese and Suppli. Both were great. The Burrata alla Caprese had fresh ingredients, and the Burrata was the perfect temperature. The Suppli was delicious -- breaded, fried, yummy rice-and-cheese-filled balls.For our pastas, we got Coda Alla Vaccinara (oxtail) and the Amatriciana. Both were fantastic. I particularly loved the oxtail. So tender, with an amazing sauce, married with the wide, thin perfect pappardelle. The Amatriciana was a perfect al dente with an outstanding sauce. I recommend both.Drinks were good. We got the Smokey Rose and Er Cubano cocktails. The house red was also good.And last of all -- the price is actually quite decent. What an awesome spot to enjoy a delicious Italian meal. Can't recommend them enough.\", \"One of my go-to recommendations for Italian food in SF. It's classy enough, but you wouldn't be judged for going in sweatpants. Food is equally good if you dine in or take out, and the price point is reasonable. Pasta is always fresh and I have genuinely liked everything I've tried on the menu, my regular being the pappardelle. If you're able to, definitely dine in and take a table outside. The decor is cozy and if the heat lamps don't give you enough warmth, each chair has a giant blanket you can use. Service is great too.\", \"Came by with a large group and we were seated outside.I ended up showing late, so didn't get to try most of the food.I personally ordered the chicken caesar salad and it was pretty good.Street parking only.\", 'Pasta Amatriciana, TiramisuOmg this blew my mind it was so amazing. The pasta is so incredible and crazy flavorful and perfectly al dente like this was so reminiscent of the pasta I had in Italy I wish I could eat this every day!!! The amatriciana was the perfect level of spiciness in my opinion, just blew my mind as a dish. The complimentary bread is just alright. You can get a free tiramisu with Yelp check in, and it was good but a little too sweet for me. Servers are great. They have this fantastic huge covered outdoor space to dine in, as well as indoor seating.', \"Wanted a good and carby meal for the day before a half marathon - this did the job! Dined in on a Saturday afternoon, indoor and outdoor seating available. It was a nice day out so sat outside. Plenty of seatings but I can only imagine how busy it gets during dinner hours!Once seated, we were welcomed with their complimentary focaccia bread. Just wow! It's not just plain boring bread. Savory and soft! A little more on the salty side but good balance with the entrees. Ordered the amatriciana, cacio e pepe, and boscaiola (tomato or cream sauce options for this one). I usually prefer red sauce but all three pastas were delicious! The amatriciana was the favorite, more flavorful out of the bunch and has a little spicy kick to it. When they say they cook the pastas al dente, they mean it. This was perfect for two of us, definitely felt full and satisfied after the meal. It's in the heart of the Marina district with shops and other businesses, so we were able to walk it off and browse. There's a free tiramisu offer on Yelp for the check-in. While it looked amazing in pictures and was told it was really good, we decided not to get it this time and try it next time. Workers had great energy and were attentive. Great hospitality!\", 'This will be short and sweet, as I stumbled upon Roma Antica while on a business trip via Door Dash. We were blown away by how fresh and delicious the pasta was. Both of us got the Boscaiola pasta with Rosa sauce and it was so flavorful and delicious! The sautéed onions, and sausage were balanced perfectly with the Rosa sauce and fresh Parmesan cheese. If their food is this good as a takeout order, I can only imagine how fantastic Roma Antica is in person. Highly recommend!', 'Had a fantastic evening at Roma Antica. IT was very easy to get a table owing to Thanksgiving weekend. Outdoor seating is very cozy with heaters and blankets. Our waiter was excellent and considerate, he even provided two carefully plated bowls when we ordered a pasta for share. The croquettes in truffle sauce were amazing. The gnocchi could have used a minute more cooking.', 'No Fees', 'SO FIRE!! Came here Friday night at 8pm for dinner. The restaurant was still lively and there was no wait. The vibes here are great! There was good music and the waiters were all having a good time dancing and singing. They were also very friendly and helpful. The food and drinks were really good and well priced. We got the carbonara, coda alla vaccinara, and the shrimp pasta. We all finished our plates. The complimentary bread with olive oil and balsamic in the beginning were also really good. The staff was so nice and gave us a panna cotta for dessert. Will def be coming back.', \"Pleasantly surprised by this italian spot in the marina! There's plenty of indoor and outdoor dining with heaters. The servers all greet you in Italian and are super friendly. The entrees were really generously portioned and everything tasted authentic and delicious. Come with an empty stomach!\", \"On a Tuesday afternoon there's a hankering for either some real mozzarella di bufula or a solid sammy with prosciutto. The menu looked good, it was open, so I gave it a shot.It happened to be a beautiful day, so the outdoor seating looked too good to pass up ( dark wood tables, wooden overhang with plants about). The waiter-- who is from Rome-- was as hospitable as you'd expect from a young Roman waiter  kind, respectful, and helpful. With a good book I ordered some bruschetta Parma with a spritz (iykyk) and a proscuitto Parma pizza to go.The focaccia bread for the table-- moist, thicc-- was excellent. Ask for some parmiggiano for the oil on the table and it's a delight. Don't fill up too much on it tho! I thought that for $12 for two slices of bruschetta, we coulda got a third-- but when you look at how much prosciutto you get, I suppose one could argue it. But a third slice of toast with the current load of ham all spread out, and a bit more cheese, would be great. The prosciutto was very tender and quality. The pizza to go looks  with a nice fire stove first and some pesto paste on there too. Will be nice for tonight and tomorrow.On the way out: a double espresso and little sweet treat cheesecake. With the lovely addition of actual Italian waiters, solid ingredients, and the great weather (plus Italian music) I quite enjoyed myself. I thought the $10 cheesecake was a bit much, then I saw the behemoth lol. I had to take most of it home. For $65.30 (remember the pizza too) you get quality stuff for sure. I don't rate on particular items solely, but the whole experience. And it's worth 5/5. Remember to tip your staff :)\", \"I recently dined at Roma Antica and indulged in their Bucatini Amatriciana. It was a flavorful masterpiece! The dish boasted the perfect spice level, and the addition of salty guanciale hidden among the noodles provided delightful surprises in every bite. The modern bar area exuded a chic ambiance, complemented by well-thought-out lighting that created a cozy yet bright dining experience. While the tables were a bit tightly packed, it's a testament to the restaurant's popularity and the need to accommodate all eager diners. The exquisite food at Roma Antica undoubtedly makes it a must-visit despite the spatial constraints.\", 'Wow!!! We arrived a bit late as it was hard to find parking in the area. ( The only challenge) The servers/ staff was awesome and accommodating. The food was very delicious!!! You feel like part of a  family at this restaurant as they treat you so kindly and they are welcoming. The food came out in a timely manner, sharable  and we even had leftovers to enjoy the next day. Highly recommend this awesome restaurant. Will definitely come back here when we are back in town!', 'Solid Italian in the Marina! My friends and I walked in on a Friday night and waited about 10 minutes for a table. We got the amatricana, margherita pizza and calamari. All were good! We sat outside near a heater and they gave us blankets which was nice. Big portions on the pasta too!', \"First, I only had the homemade pappardelle slowly cooked , oxtail Ragu- Giuseppe, the bartender, recommended it, and he didn't lie like his son, Pinocchio...his long nosed son from the children's  fable-I went straight to heaven--very homemade, melted in my mouth. I wanted more but this dish made me full...I was already full when I came in here--I just wanted to drink some tequila--Giuseppe...he funny guy ...Best Service you'll have in this town - - everybody was extremely pleasant to me--wayward single minstrel with a smile and a shoeshine, and that's it--the  restaurant - - they made me feel at home. it's important to me - -Ambience, feeling at home is more important to me than the food itself - - but, that's just me-- Daphne is a true piece of work--I watched her dance around the smiling patrons, like a bunch of Tinker Bell's and I could see the smile she brought to the patron's faces - - a true professional--funny - - funny lady, if I owned  this place I'd want everybody to be like her--Andy --very nice guy--didn't know me from a hole in the wall, but asked me how my food was... --his shift was over, he wasn't waiting on me- - nothing to do with me...yet...he took the time...that spoke volumes about Andy the man - - Which brings me to the ambience - - - It's a little noisy, but not unbearable - - everybody that works here is funny - - I don't know about you, but when I go out for dinner, I don't want to see a sourpuss--the people that work here are either faking it till they make it or they really like their job and I think they really like their job, -it's the latter - and it shows--I write very few reviews, I'm very fussy and there is a certain type of place I like - - -This is that place! JuanitoPSHi-its Juanito, The Welsh bard, again...I liked this place so much, I returned two night later-My favorite Italian pasts is Carbonara-this truly is silky and creamy and delicious--speaking of this, Maria waited on me for lunch last week --(shame Juanito...I forgot,)--fabulous dinner and Maria is as fabulous as both --one more hat tip--Alexandra, owner-very pleasant chap-its a smart owner who comes over and presses the flesh and talks with you...Indeed\", 'Slay service, slay food, slay vibes!My group of 3 came on a Sunday night and we were sat down immediately; we decided to sit outside. They had a lot of space outside and made sure to keep us warm with blankets and outdoor warmers.They had a happy hour special with $12 cocktails and we tried the Moscow Mules (3/5)  and Limoncello Spritz (3/5). We also ordered the Cacio e Pepe (4/5), Amatriciana (4.5/5) and Coda Alla Vaccinara (4.5/5). All of the pastas would be a perfect (5/5) but the pasta was kind of hard. Portions were amazing and we were very full after!Our waiter was super attentive, friendly, and helpful. Remember to checkin for a free tiramisu (4/5 - super creamy and yummy)!', \"Located in the Marina District in San Francisco, this Italian restaurant has fresh homemade pasta. Very tasty oxtail pasta. There's also a kid menu ranging from pasta to pizza. We ordered a cheese pizza that came out looking like a cute bear with tomatoes as eyes and basil as the lips. There's also this copper-looking pizza oven. I shared the ox tail pasta and the staff were so thoughtful to separate the bowls into two plates. The octopus was fresh, chewy and crunchy like Costa Rica. It's not the old-tasting googey kind. The exterior sitting area has heat lamps and looks so chill. This restaurant makes you feel like you are dining somewhere in Europe\\xa0on\\xa0vacation.\", \"I ventured in here one evening, impromptu to with some guests from Canada, after an evening at The Academy of Science. We popped in close to closing, but that was not an issue. We were seated promptly.    The ambience, is dim lit, chill, modern rustic- intimate and relaxing. This is a great spot for dinner with friends, dinner with a group, or an intimate date night. They had a nice wine list, italian centric, which is fine with me- it pairs well with the food.   Now, let me get on to their menu... let me say their food is a 100. This is coming from someone that frequents Italy. I would have to say, the food here is the closest of had to Italian cuisine in Italy- depending on the region of course. With that said, I absolutely love this restaurant- it's a must!\", 'No Fees']\n",
