<h2>Reviews</h2>
<p>Took our adopted sister out to lunch! Hadn‚Äôt seen her in a couple of years. We had the delicious soup, frozen margs and guacamole</p>
<p>Was a night mare  bad service !  Horrible experience . They have no idea how to provide customer service . They want to charge like a 5 start restaurant  but no idea how to treat people</p>
<p>If you happen to be visiting Los Angeles, and you're in the area. And you want to try some really great Mexican food. This is it? Your stomach will be happy really good place to eat</p>
<p>this is as old school 70s mexican place as  LA gets.  the fantastic red leather booths, the art work and the food of course is fabulous !!! The prices are not ridiculous and the staff are wonderful.   I love a place with spanish tile on...the inside as well as christmas lights !!!More</p>
<p>Amazing spot! Lovely place for a date night or family dinner. The margaritas and the food are to die for and if you catch the live music you‚Äôre really in for a treat. Get the carne asada plate or the Chile relleno and burrito plate.</p>
<p>Super friendly staff and great food. Really enjoyed my time at el compadre. The food was great and the atmosphere was very neat. Definitely recommend.</p>
<p>Good for spend time with friends and family , delicious food and delicious Margaritas , totally recommend</p>
<p>We had a great experience. The infused margaritas and fajitas were great. The best part is we got a picture taken by a nice lady!</p>
<p>I love going here for dinner. a good place. always cozy. tasty. I recommend trying the tacos and flaming Margarita. It so good</p>
<p>had a great time! food & drinks were excellent, good service and very friendly staff, would definitely recommend</p>
<p>Great food, great atmosphere, came for a friends birthday, it rocked. Alina was great, very nice, food came quick</p>
<p>It was a nice evening with a great atmosphere! We even had a photo taken to remember our night by the most sweetest photographer. 10/10 would recommend.</p>
<p>Good place. Our favourite family restaurant for family dinner. 
I like this food and service so much</p>
<p>A great spot to take a group of friends and fun atmosphere to be in. Unlimited chips and salsa with fresh and authentic Mexican dishes. Highly reccomended.</p>
<p>Good food, good service, but not so good atitude. They offer you free photo, then try to sell you more photos, and if you don't want to buy them, they kind of pressure you to exchange them for a review on TRIPADVISOR, asking you to...show them your review, which is private. That is how they got their 5 stars. The place is good, and understand they want to promote it, but are pushing too much in their marketing strategy. Also I think the ambience is not apropriate for families with children.More</p>
<p>Such a great atmosphere food is delicious always a great time! The hospitality is great they are very attentive and kind</p>
<p>The best food! The photos were fantastic, wonderful singing, wonderful vibes, wonderful everything! Thankful!</p>
<p>Great service, very friendly, and amazing food. Waiter took very good care of us. Photographer took amazing pictures to capture the memories. Recommend coming here.</p>
<p>So wonderful! Amazing drinks! Great atmosphere - very cozy and good vibes. Delicious salsa as well.</p>
<p>We love El Compadre - great flaming margaritas, and the best crunch tacos in town! We also love the enchiladas. Great meat, excellent chips and salsa, plus love music and good atmosphere. Couldn‚Äôt ask for a better Mexican restaurant experience!</p>
<p>I always love coming here‚Ä¶ such a lovely staff and great food! Can‚Äôt wait to come back here !! It‚Äôs a great night out with friends !</p>
<p>my date and i were sat down and asked by a very wonderful woman to get our photos taken. she was so sweet and kind to us and made our night wonderful. she also was generous enough to give us MULTIPLE copies with no charge...More</p>
<p>Dined at El Compadre and was truly impressed. The salmon dish was perfectly cooked and flavorful. The strawberry margarita is a must-try ‚Äì refreshingly sweet and well-balanced. Highly recommend for a delightful Mexican experience!</p>
<p>We came on a Friday night for a lively, but chill dinner. We got seated immediately in one of their classic big red booths and had some tasty tacos. Love that the margaritas come flaming, it‚Äôs a fun touch.
They even had a photographer coming...More</p>
<p>Came here after not scoring tickets to a dodger game, atmosphere was great and the parking was easy. The salsa was also super good, my girlfriend who usually doesn‚Äôt like salsa loved it here!</p>
<p>Good place. Our favourite family restaurant for family dinner. 
I like this food and service so much</p>
<p>Staff was great and love that the chips are complementary. Loved the flaming marg üç∏ will be back !!!!!!</p>
<p>Great date spot!! Great margarita, nice employees and awesome ambiance. The food is delicious and reasonably priced. I will definitely be back ASAP with my friends instead of my dang stinking boyfriend.  Love it here!!!!</p>
<p>What a lovely ambience! Drinks were delicious, staff was super nice and we even got our pictures taken. Highly recommend for a night out at a reasonable price.</p>
<p>The atmosphere at this restaurant is intoxicating! The live music on Friday night was so fun and the flaming margaritas were lots of fun! A great place for any occasion and delicious eats.</p>
<p>N/Naka is an extraordinary dining establishment that offers an exquisite culinary experience. Led by Chef Niki Nakayama, the restaurant showcases an impressive blend of Japanese and Californian cuisine.</p>
<p>the meeting was planned there with the good references that I have seen of it and by visiting it I could see that it is true</p>
<p>We saw N/Naka on chefs table season 1 and was intrigued. The 6 of us not only thought that the food was epic and up to the 2 Michelin stars but the waiter was amazing! It‚Äôs a very small space and it felt like he...was there just for us. And the unique sake‚Äôs was really different and interesting. The easiest way to score a table is get a group of 6 together. These places have to figure out a way yo stop people from scoring a 2 top and selling on those bid for a table web sites. Go if you can it will blow your mind.More</p>
<p>the meal started slow, wasn‚Äôt impressed by the initial dishes. only started getting into the meat of things (hah) with the A5 wagyu course. everything after that was deliciousness.

perfect amount of sake/wine in the pairing. overall, n/naka was nice to try but lacking the...creativity/inventiveness that I prefer in my meals. especially at that price point.More</p>
<p>Always look forward to coming here.  It's busy for a reason. Staff are friendly and the food is excellent.  Hard to beat!</p>
<p>We have been to many Japanese restaurants in California and n/naka is by far the best. It is open now for seating (as of June 16) so go there and give yourself time. It is an experience not be missed or rushed. If you are...celebrating something very special this is also the place for you. It is fine dinning so please don't show up in shorts. Make a reservation and have the best time.

They have a wonderful sake selection, you want it, they have it and a lot of it is served by the glass, they also have a fab wine selection.

The food is to die for. Their OTSUKURI, traditional sashimi, is the best you will have. They have tasting menus that are amazing--some with 13 courses. Try their MIZUMONO, which is a Yellow Peach Mousse Castella Cake, Italian Meringue,
White Peach Jelly, Yellow Plum Sorbet, and  Sunflower Seeds--just OMG.

The service is second to none, the place is spotless and beautiful. You really have to see it. It is pricey for a reason. Have fun.More</p>
<p>This a great placer for a good date
It is one of my favorite restaurants, the best food and the best place to escape from the routine with your partner, I liked very much its less since it is very varied and according to the...site located exceeding expectationsMore</p>
<p>The place is clean, decent, with high ceilings and captivating decorations that are picture-perfect. The service is quick and reliable. Their food is delicious and reasonably priced. Overall, this is the perfect place to dine in. This is my ideal restaurant. I highly recommend this...place to everyone.More</p>
<p>The fascinating ambiance that breaks you to Korea. The smell of the grilled meat and also looks so good. You can't get enough of it. As well as the kimchi and other dishes. It was a great experience to dine in. I will surely visit...this restaurant again and you should too. I am sure that you will love it!More</p>
<p>Amazing! This restaurant was fabulous! Their staffs were very helpful and accommodating. The chef's cooked was very admirable on his very nice taste. He did excellently that day and it was remarkable. It melts my precious heart. I feel the happiness of the food He...made. I am very grateful to Him for providing us great food.More</p>
<p>I have been coming to this restaurant for years and every amazing thing that you have heard is true! One thing that doesn‚Äôt get talked about often enough is the amazing service that consistently accompanies every small detail of each meal served by Chef Niki...and her team.  Another thing I wanted to highlight is their amazing selection of sake-  of course a restaurant featuring Japanese food will offer sake but n/naka has introduced me to some great ones I have not found anywhere else. Of course the food is fantastic and really hard to describe in words because it‚Äòs not only delicious it‚Äôs also a work of art combined with a true labor of love.  I guess my one attempt at describing some aspect of the food at n/naka would be the Abalone Pasta-  I would like to go swimming in a pool completely filled with this abalone pasta and then eat my way out of it.  And that‚Äôs only one of the many fantastic courses you will enjoy at n/naka!More</p>
<p>Absolutely a once in a lifetime experience. Loved everything. We went in late December. I was pregnant (and an vegetarian), and my husband eats everything. The food was fantastic, catered to us. Every bite better than the last.</p>
<p>It was very difficult to get reservation; the food and service were excellent. I especially liked the tuna.</p>
<p>Food was really good, I would definitely recommend you to try their shashimi. We will be coming back soon!</p>
<p>Probably the best I never enjoyed in my life before.
Not good but excellent food, some proposals following the tradition some others following the modern fusion gourmet cuisine. Very unique cocktails. Totally recommended.</p>
<p>MINUS 5 stars for n/ naka's reservation system.

Every Sunday at 10AM I start trying to book a date. For a few minutes a date and time shows as available, but click it and not available. Every time. Moments later, all seats are booked and...More</p>
<p>The warm welcome and superb service are complimented by the high quality of the fish ingredients. This is sushi of the highest quality. We loved our visit and will return. Highly recommended.</p>
<p>There are so many great, new places to eat in Los Angeles; it's certainly one of the world's most important food cities right now. My most recent experience a n/naka was the beast meal I've eaten in Los Angeles. Wonderful service, austere design and the...More</p>
<p>As far as the quality of fish goes, it is very difficult to find a restaurant of this caliber even in Ginza, Tokyo.   I gave them only 4 stars though because of two issues.
One is the difficulty getting the reservation.  The other is the...More</p>
<p>It is O.K. if you are not hungry; the Chef is an artist and you can consider the evening as a visit to a foodie-art gallery. Note that the place only serves the Chef's menu, or more precisely the dishes she dreams up for the...More</p>
<p>Like so many others all I can do is rave about my experience. Its not pretentious, but rather focused on the food and me. Service is exceptional and have the Sake/wine pairing!!!  Don‚Äôt drive if you take advantage of pairing lol.</p>
<p>It was difficult to make reservation but once you have experienced the food, it made it all worth it. Definitely not cheap, but I do not regret it.</p>
<p>Our first n/naka's experience was amazing. We enjoyed everything absolutely everything. The food is amazing. Will surely back again soon! very soon.</p>
<p>Prices aren‚Äôt for the faint of heart but the food is good - Japanese with a modern twist. Service was great too.</p>
<p>My bf surprised me with reservation here for a big milestone birthday. I had been trying for months to get a reservation online, but he was somehow able to get one without me knowing!  I can only say, every single dish (all 14+) were not...More</p>
<p>Our first n/naka's experience was amazing. We enjoyed everything here. The food and service were excellent. Will surely back again soon!</p>
<p>Amazing food for an amazing service!  The level of the chef is over the top and presentation and taste are sometimes unique</p>
<p>The level of thought that goes into each dish is unparalleled. It is all incredibly tasty but the detailed presentation is where food meets art and turns this great meal into an experience that stays with you. Be prepared, it is not cheap, but when...More</p>
<p>As so many have noted, the food is both exquisite in taste and presentation.  Several of the courses ranked among the best I have ever had.  

We also were very fortunate in that our dinner partners procured our reservation on the first try!  

I felt...More</p>
<p>This is a rare experience. I suggest the sake pairing which will add big bucks to your meal AND is worth every penning.</p>
<p>Stopped in for an Anniversary Dinner.
After 6 pm free parking is a plus.
Large lot across the street. First the Staff

AAA+ Rating from TripAdvisor Top!
Thanks üòä  Owners & Staff Excellent !!!More</p>
<p>It was late on a Saturday evening, and 5 of us decided to go to dinner somewhere we hadn‚Äôt been. We looked up Trip Advisor for restaurants in San Pedro, and Ruffaello was the Number 1 entry on their list, and for well deserved rating....The place was packed and the dining rooms are large and noisy but in a good kind of large family gathering way. I had called ahead and asked about a wait time for 5 and they said the could get us set in about 10 min and when we arrived, we just had to wait for the table to be cleared and cleaned. Service was excellent even though the place was crowded. They immediately brought us Bruschetta, Italian Peppers, Bread and butter, the Bruschetta was excellent with tomatoes that tested fresh from the vine. While we consumed these delights it gave us a chance to order from the menu. 

We ordered Fried Calamari as an appetizer because as we walked to the restaurant, 3 different couples we passed who were just leaving, said it was the best they had had. We ordered Veal Piccata, Lobster Ravioli, Eggplant Parmesan, Penne Rustica with Shrimp and Sausage, and Linguini with Clams and Mussels. All the dinners came with a salad and the serving sizes were large. With the exception of the Lobster Ravioli we all had enough for a leftover meal at home. The house Chianti was delicious as well. 

Universally we all talked about how delicious or own plate was which led to sharing bits across the table. The Lobster Ravioli was the best we have had. The pasta wasn‚Äôt gummy like many are, there was good portion of lobster in the stuffing, and the sauce was delicate and not overbearing. It was had to select the best dish we ordered as they were all excellent. We all agreed that it reminded us of the dinners we had in Italy especially in Sorrento.

If you are looking for a romantic night out with great food, this is not a place to go. But if you want an authentic family style Italian Restaurant, you won‚Äôt find much better than RaffaelloMore</p>
<p>Becoming our ‚Äú Go To,‚Äù place fir graduations, jazz band performances.  With Italian family.  Grilled octopus is fantastic.</p>
<p>The service, food, and experience was like a dream come true...If you want a delightful dinner and celebration of your loved one's 100th Birthday, come to Raffaello's Restaurant in San Pedro! My name is Pinocchio, the lying Disney boy puppet...do the exact opposite and run...fast to Gaetano's, Olive Garden, Il Fornaio...FAST!!!More</p>
<p>Love this place - great food, great people, always a treat.  They will pound the veal scaloppine very thin if you ask, which is huge appreciated. Tomato sauce is made in house.</p>
<p>Super good Italian restaurant. I recommend pasta it was amazing nice.For sure we will come back whit our friends.</p>
<p>Wonderful spot for dinner. We come every time we are in San Pedro. Food is excellent. I really like the cioppino and the veal scallopine. Service is great! Just wish we lived closer!</p>
<p>My wife had the family recipe Lasagna; I had the veal marsala; and, our friend had the pasta with house sauce. All meals were excellent. Meals came with bread and salad. We were waited on by the son of this family owned business. We love...to support local business when we travel and you can't get more local than family owned. Excellent service throughout the meal. there were several groups being served and you could tell they were also having fun and that many were returning customers. This restaurant has a warm and homey atmosphere. We highly recommend this restaurant. San Pedro has many restaurants and we were visiting and could not visit them all. Boy, we made a great selection with this choice. could not have done better.More</p>
<p>The most welcoming, Italian eatery with a warm family feel to it restaurant I've come across anywhere other than a "Little Italy" district out in New York. I've heard of this place as all the locals know of it. Heard nothing but great things about...the family thats owned this establishment for half a century, to the restaurant itself (decor, environment, location, comfortable spacious,etc). You really do get a feeling that you're eating amongst family here.
The ONLY set back and its only my personal opinion or preference is that most all of the entrees in my large order all seemed to be just a tad bit more on the bland side than what i would've ever guessed.  That caught me by surprise. Food was good for the most part but I was expecting more rich flavor from each dish. Still good and a lovely selection.
Great desserts also. I would request for an olive oil with fresh cracked pepper to be served in addition instead of just a few small butter pats with the bread.More</p>
<p>For being the second rated restaurant in the Los Angeles area, I was not super impressed. It was not bad by any stretch of the imagination. The food wasn‚Äôt all that special. The service and atmosphere were great however.</p>
<p>visited recently to celebrate my son‚Äôs birthday, food was great, value for money, great wine selection and wonderful service! will visit again any time i go back to california!!</p>
<p>This place is so accommodating to families.  WE have been there twice(this being number two) and the staff recalled meeting us.  They are in the right amount of contact with respect to letting you enjoy food and making sure the plates don't overtake the table....Such and enjoyable place. Oh and the food!  Man, A taste of what is good<finger tips pinched together and the sound muah!!!>  Love this food!!

If you are traveling around, Seek out this place and partake in some good east!.

Caio Tony, Raffello!More</p>
<p>Food is great. Staff are extremely generous and quick to refill drinks, give complementary bread and salads etc. Was our cheapest meal of the trip yet by far the best.</p>
<p>My wife and I came here, for the first time, to celebrate our anniversary. We sure are glad we did! What a terrific experience‚Ä¶

Complimentary bread, saut√©ed bell peppers, bruschetta, and salad. What?! What other restaurant does that? So generous.

The service was friendly and...fast. 

The ambiance is classy, homey, and clean. 

The food is delicious. I have a feeling that everything on the menu tastes good.

We‚Äôll definitely be recommending Raffaello to friends and family.More</p>
<p>I can only give this restaurant a score of 5 out of 5.  Family run , excellent extensive menu and very good value for money.  If you are in San Pedro you must visit.  We loved the atmosphere and the staff were amazing especially the...son of one of the owners , Alessamdro.    A real local gem.More</p>
<p>This restaurant is that hidden gem you‚Äôve been looking for. We‚Äôd traveled from the UK and saw this in Tripadvisor, #2 restaurant in LA, and as it‚Äôs 30 miles from central LA, we thought it was worth a visit. We were not disappointed, We went...More</p>

<p>We love the Italian food at Raffaello's. There are many wonderful Italian restaurants in Los Angeles. This is one of them.

The service is divine, everyone is so friendly and caring. They know the menu well and can make excellent wine selections for you. What...More</p>
<p>My son and I love dinners at Raffaello's!  You will always get a great meal (we love the chicken parmesan) and friendly atmosphere from staff and clientele.   Just come hungry because they will feed you well!</p>
<p>once they get to full staff this will again rise to be a very good restaurant, but for now it is just good.</p>
<p>good Italian, but it has lost an edge since COVID. it was all good, just not quite as great as before.</p>
<p>Upon recommendation of John Papadakis of Papadakis Taverna fame, we selected Gino Cutri‚Äôs restaurant to cater our daughter‚Äôs wedding reception.  Gino and his team lived up to their stellar reputation.  All of the food was delicious and the presentation was well done.  The staff were...More</p>

<p>The food here is not the best of the Italian places I've visited, but it's solid. Portions are large to have the leftovers for lunch the next day, service is top notch, very friendly staff n the ambiance feels like a big family gathering. Not...More</p>
<p>This highly rated ristorante certainly lived up to it's rating!! The food was truly special and the service outstanding. The Italian cuisine is among the best anywhere and cannot be overlooked if you are ever in San Pedro. This is a must dining experience!!</p>
<p>The Xiao Long Bao were also delicious, with a flavorful soup inside. The Steamed Pork Buns were soft and fluffy, with a savory filling.</p>
<p>OUTSTANDING!!!  Wonderful menu. The Dim Sum came out HOT - full of flavor. Servers were helpul and attentive. Will certainly return again.</p>
<p>The pork dumplings were incredibly juicy and delicious! I couldn't get enough of them. The squid ink XLB was also a standout, with its unique flavors. The service was truly awesome, with kind and attentive staff who went above and beyond. The atmosphere was great,...creating a wonderful dining experience, and the drinks were both refreshing and delicious.More</p>
<p>There were 8 of us, family get-together, and our first time at this Culver City dimsum restaurant.
There were many tables outside under the patio, though we opt'd for inside, which is less conducive towards a bigger table.
The food was excellent, though slightly higher...priced than some other restaurants in the Monterey Park area.
The server, Anthony (?) was excellent, helpful, attentive without being obtrusive and there when needed, with a bit of humor.  He also introduced other members of the staff and kitchen to us, which was very nice.
Parking can be a bit difficult around the area, though we did get a spot near some residential areas less than half a block away.
All in all, all 8 of us said the food was excellent, service was excellent, and we took our time eating and chatting among ourselves.
I would highly recommend this restaurant.More</p>
<p>I had an excellent dining experience. The food was incredibly delicious. I opted for the regular dim sum while my friend went for the vegan options. Surprisingly, we couldn't distinguish any difference in taste between the two. This makes it a fantastic choice for vegans....The staff was exceptionally friendly and accommodating, and we were promptly seated upon arrival.More</p>
<p>Awful awful lot of people are in the same way and they are usually in the same way as they are usually in the same way they are</p>
<p>What a cozy place to eat DimSum for your lunch. Let me say up front that part of the coziness comes from the two guys who are in the service and behind the bar. The DimSum is of very good quality. I was curious about...The Magnificent Six - Xiao Long Bao. Those are samples of all six or their colored soup dumplings. Wow! Those were very flavorful and tasty.More</p>
<p>We went at 11:30 on a Saturday morning and was seated right away. We chose to eat inside but there's also nice patio tables. There were two of us and we ordered 2 green teas and 4 dishes: pork and shrimp shut mai, steamed bbq...pork buns, pork soup dumplings, and wontons. Everything was really good but we probably wouldn't order the wontons again. With the 20% tip our bill was just under sixty dollars. That's a bit expensive but we enjoyed the food, service was excellent, and there was street parking. We will definitely return to try other things on the menu.More</p>
<p>Hello,

Thank you for dining with us.

We appreciate you taking the time to write a review and give us a 5-star rating.

We're pleased to hear that you enjoyed some of the dim sum dishes. The jumbo pork & shrimp Siu Mai are our...More</p>
<p>First time here last night, and will come as often as I can.  What a great place!  We were 4 people and we ordered a fair amount of plates to share.  They were so delicious that we kept ordering more, including repeats on several of...the dishes.  And I don't know how they do it, but somehow it felt special, quiet, and relaxing sitting outside despite the fact that we were mere feet from busy Venice Blvd.  Such a nice setting.  The food, staff, and service were extra great.  Top marks.More</p>
<p>This is a neighborhood gem in downtown Los Angeles.  The fresh,  hand-made pasta we sampled was delicious.  It was very hard deciding what to order among the dishes, so we will definitely go back to try some more.  The flourless chocolate cake was also scrumptious....The owner was very friendly and helpful with menu choices.  The restaurant has a nice outdoor dining area.  Prices were modest, especially in comparison to most downtown restaurants. I think this may be my favorite place for pasta in L.A.More</p>
<p>Good food , typical italian style pasta, but  very bad service. We waited 45 minutes before being served (added to 1 hour waiting before entering, because this restaurant do not accept reservations); 
After my complaining about this, no regrets from the staff that said us...to go back to italy‚Ä¶furthermore the bill has been presented with a 18% of service added by the restaurant, instead of leaving to the customer this choice.More</p>
<p>Indeed, this restaurant boasts an impressive array of delectable dishes. The scampi, grilled squid, and calamari are simply outstanding, showcasing the chef's culinary prowess.</p>
<p>they definitely set the bar for my experience. be sure to make reservations early, once you get there and get seated you'll see why. 

the food was phenomenal. the Bigoli Della set me right on the first bite, ambience was spot on, and a pocket...surprise some of the staff even spoke Italian with me. Would and will come back here frequently. 

For the family,
Consiglio questo posto a chiunque cerchi autentica cucina italiana!More</p>
<p>This place lived up to it‚Äôs previous reviews. Delicious!
We decided to come for lunch instead of dinner to avoid waiting lines. The food here is absolutely delicious and tasty.
Service is amazing and super fast. Hope I can come back.</p>
<p>We had diner here our last night in LA and were pleased we did. Very nice servers and great burrata to start. Next we had seafood pasta and tortellini. One of our order got mixed up however this was quickly fixed. The outside terras had...a nice and romantic atmosphere and with the heathers was nice to stay out late. 
We did have to wait for a table for about 45 minutes however the system with texting worked great and we spent the time waiting in the food court across the streetMore</p>
<p>Outstanding 100% real Italian pasta . We ordered 4 different pasta and all of them were delicious . I highly recommend the Bigoli Della Nonna it was amazing 
You must stop here if you‚Äôre in downtown 
Grazie di tutto , sicuramente ci rivedremo quando saremo...nuovamente in L.A. 
Great job guysMore</p>
<p>Stumbled onto this gem by chance during the week. Got lucky with an outdoor table under the heater. It‚Äôs possible they were short staffed as we had the owner wait on us. Fantastic pasta and the BEST dessert (cheesecake) I have ever had, anywhere! Had...such a great meal my wife and I went back a few nights later and we both ordered the exact same meal we had 2 nights earlier, including the same bottle of wine. We will be back next time we are in LAMore</p>
<p>The food was great, we could definitely tell that the pasta and bread were fresh. Nothing like I've had before!! We also got fried mozzarella and it was absolutely delicious and the sauce that went with it.......chefs kiss

The staff was also great, they were...attentive and gave good suggestions and recommendations on drinks and food.More</p>
<p>We loved this restaurant! We were originally told 30 minute wait but it was actually only about 10 minutes. They have an area outside to stand and wait with some greenery. The overall ambiance of the restaurant is so great. Lots of trees, plants, and...even heaters on the patio. Two of us got wine and two got beer. They surprisingly didn‚Äôt have Peroni, but they liked the Italian beers on the menu. We each got different entrees and all loved them. Lasagna, spaghetti with meatballs, Maccheroni stellari, and rigatoni Pom‚Äôamore. The garlic bread is also a must for appetizer. Our server was great and attentive. This is also next to Grand Central Market so we checked that out after. We will be back!! 

P.S. we walked from the Westin and there was a block or two that was questionable as far as safety so we may take an Uber next time. Just a note if you‚Äôre walking the same route to the restaurant at night.More</p>
<p>Nice atmosphere, amazing home made food. It‚Äôs so laid back like a nice family meal, will be my new go to spot in LA.</p>
<p>It was really good Italian restaurant which i recommend it for sure. Home made pasta with a reasonable price and good taste.  I will recommend this place and you get pretty good pastas with good price.</p>
<p>Tonight's dinner included a variety of pasta dishes, including squid ink and fish, black and white thin pasta (a personal favorite), pumpkin ravioli with butter truffle sauce, bone marrow with salsa verde, and calamari. Everything was incredibly tasty. I strongly advise.</p>
<p>Great food and attentive service! We shared a ‚Äúspecial‚Äù dish of gnocchi with a mushroom sauce.  Also fried mozzarella and bread pudding. All excellent.</p>
<p>Great neighborhood Italian pasta bar for a low-key family dinner. They don‚Äôt take reservations, and the place may get a little busy later in the afternoon, but on a Friday around 5 pm we got a table without any wait time. The menu has a...good selection of appetizers and home-made pasta choices. Both the garlic bread and the burrata on a bed of tomato chutney were delicious. My linguine with frutti di mare did not disappoint either. If there is anything I could‚Äôve altered around it is the proportion of pasta to seafood. Pair that with some house wine, and you have yourself a relaxing dinner with some excellent Italian comfort food of home-cooked quality. Keep in mind that this restaurant is located in a neighborhood that gets ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù in the evening. Despite the strong recommendation of our Uber driver, we decided to take a quick walk after dinner to the Last Bookstore (also very much worth a visit), that is literally within a 5-minute walk. No, I‚Äôd say don‚Äôt walk, rather drive or take an Uber instead. This area gets really sketchy (quintessential LA DT flavor).More</p>

<p>Lovely spot to grab some delicious vegan food.
Many options to choose from on the menu, from bowls to wraps/burgers.
The buffalo cauli wings are particularly good.
Staff friendly and nice vibe.
On the expensive side so good for a treat but not everyday.</p>
<p>Thank you for the positive feedback!</p>
<p>I‚Äôve never had a meal I didn‚Äôt LOVE at various locations of this restaurant (Santa Cruz, San Diego, and formerly in SF and San Rafael). This time was no different. I always order too many dishes because I know they will be packed with flavor....This time we had the Yo Soy Fuerza wrap which was delicious and managed to not fall apart at any point. I ate the whole thing one-handed - the way any wrap or sandwich should be made, IMO. The fries that came with it were fantastic as was the side of buffalo cauliflower. I ordered a cinnamon roll to go, just to try it, and although it‚Äôs not as big and beautiful-looking as some, it packs a lot of flavor and has the right texture. This is a great stop for anyone vegetarian or vegan. They‚Äôre not trying to duplicate non-veg dishes, but rather they create veggie dishes that stand on their own merit.More</p>
<p>Thank you Erin for the positive feedback! We are glad that you've enjoyed dining in at several of our locations and hope to see you again soon in Venice!</p>
<p>This is one of the best plant based restaurants I have visited. My husband and I spent 3 days in LA, and ate breakfast here every day. Really friendly, helpful staff, and fantastic food - what's not to like! We can't wait to return.</p>
<p>Thank you for the positive feedback! We look forward to your next visit!</p>
<p>My partner and I visited here after a recommendation. Neither of us our vegan, but this food is absolutely superb. It was delicious and full of flavour with lots of options. I would highly recommend to anyone!</p>
<p>Thank you Hannah for the positive feedback!</p>
<p>A couple of days before, I ate at Millennium Restaurant in Oakland with Michelin award which calls itself the #1 vegetarian restaurant in the world. I found the food to be so bland, I wondered if I had just made the mistake of being an...omnivore in a vegan environment.

But the food at Cafe Gratitude was bursting with umami rich flavours. So tasty, by any standards. Even for an omnivore. 

So well done Cafe Gratitude. You are awesome!More</p>
<p>Thank you Ralph! We're so glad that you enjoyed your experience dining in with us! We look forward to serving you again next time!</p>
<p>The food was absolutely delicious!!!  Wish there was a Cafe Gratitude in NC.  We went to brunch every day while visiting CA.  Highly recommend!!!</p>
<p>I was visiting from London for a work trip. I popped in and it was terrific. I highly recommend. The food was fresh, staff friendly and they were incredibly well presented and the venue was super hygienic!</p>
<p>We had a wonderful vegan meal.  So delicious!! Also, so wonderful to find so many gluten free meals and desserts! Will definitely go back. Please open a restaurant in Colorado.</p>

<p>This New-Age vegan cafe offers inspiration with its kale. Every dish is named some wonderful virtue and the servers ask you a profound "question of the day" when they greet you. The food is fresh and healthy. Prices are moderate. There is 90 minutes of...free parking with validation if you turn at their corner and go down into the parking structureMore</p>
<p>Its a favorite restaurant - at any of their locations - because its not just food, its an experience and almost meditative. I haven't had a bad entree here and love experimenting knowing full well its safe to eat anything and everything here. My favorite...however is any of their bowls. (Eclectic) Buffalo Cauliflower has been a go-to of mine for years as the flavors are always consistent and runner up is the (Ecstatic) Roasted Brussels Sprouts which is always outstanding.More</p>
<p>Friends took us to this one yesterday. Sat outside first, a bit chilly, then inside. Nice, but no atmosphere‚Äã I would travel for. My wife loved her lentil soup and the nachos. I had the burger, which I loved. After my stroke‚Äã last year, fries...are a treat I am only supposed to have now and then - and then they better be good. Sadly, these were not. They were soggy. I did not eat them, and the waiter did not care.

Then: the desert was excellent‚Äã. All in all, it was simply not good enough to go again, let alone take a detour (mandatory with me to get five stars). 

A little more attention to detail in food and service, and I might go back.More</p>
<p>The cafe gratitude as always is so so good. A real variety of options and the quality of food is superb. Big fan of the blue shake, so delicious and different. Service can be slow but gives you time to relax and enjoy.</p>

<p>Had the I Love You Bowl and immortal coffee. So tasty and healthy. I can't wait to come back again. Wish they would open in Colorado.</p>
<p>The food is outstanding. Everything we took was delicious. The eggplant sandwich, the nachos were probably best we ever had, the bowl was great too. The iron cast cookie was not as good and so the coffee.</p>
<p>We had an excellent breakfast at this cheery eatery. A bright, modern dining room, professional and friendly staff, an innovative menu, and outstanding coffee. What's not to like. Highly recommended.</p>
<p>Didn't actually realise this was a vegan restaurant but glad we tried.  The food was healthy and delicious and staff very helpful and knowledgeable with menu and wines.</p>

<p>Vegan Place, Excellent concept, menu and Service
The atmosphere is very convivial, Friendly Staff, Great Vegan Options + Desserts.</p>
<p>We have been travelling in the US for a month now & have been disappointed with the vegan options available... until now. Great restaurant- great vegan food - great service- great for kids</p>
<p>Very good vegan restaurant.  Clearly popular with the locals.  I went there three times while in Santa Monica.  I had the fried mushroom burger, a burrito, and a flight of healthy shots - all good.</p>
<p>The absolute best meal we had on our trip.  We dined at The Polo Lounge, Chateau Marmont (which were both excellent) and several other notable places around West Hollywood but nothing compares to the meal we had here. Authentic Italian cuisine-extremely flavorful and fresh made...ingredients. The burato was out of this world and entrees were perfection. We finished the meal with a freshly made carrot cake. Most importantly it had a neighborhood feel with no pretentiousness that made you feel like you were at home. Don‚Äôt miss out on this amazing experience.More</p>
<p>We were greeted at the door by Elizabetta. From the moment we walked in, she was very kind and very attentive. She was very knowledgeable in the available options, along with suggestions for pairings with our food. We hope to be back in the near...future and we hope it‚Äôs on a night that she is there! Thank you!

Also, the atmosphere here is very lovely! We imagined that it would be hard to pull off nice outdoor seating right next to Beverly Blvd but this place pulls it off! :)More</p>
<p>We were running 15 minutes late yet were still greeted warmly and welcomed in. We chose to sit outside and pleased we did as we had a table in the courtyard area which had a nice romantic feel and was more private than the seating...on the street area. We ate the lemon cream spaghetti and lasagne, both tasted amazing. The profiteroles for pudding were delicious, I would highly recommend them! All the staff were friendly and attentive, and able to help with some questions about the wine.More</p>
<p>Good food quality , great service , nice place to have an authentic Italian meal with good ingredients and taste delicious Gino always the welcoming and gracious host helping around where needed ready to offer you a cheese plate or advising with the menu, our...host Simone gave us great service very gracious and experienced , all in all very good evening with good food good wine will return to this place very soonMore</p>
<p>This place is overrated! The food was good but not exceptional. The service was friendly but one of the four of us had to wait at least 10 minutes for his meal after the other three were served. And the prices were exorbitant -- over...$50 for so-so fish entrees (Dover Sole and Branzino) -- that's ridiculous. Oh ... not to be forgotten -- the place was really, really noisy!!! If you have any hearing deficits at all, go someplace else (and probably have a better meal at a more reasonable cost)More</p>
<p>We went to Angelini Osteria on a Monday night and it was packed. We sat by the door and there was a constant stream of new customers coming in to be seated.

We ordered the Octopus (fried) - served on a bed of arugula. It...was tasty.

We shared an order of the Sea Urchin (uni) linguine - because of course, you‚Äôre at an Italian restaurant so you must have pasta, right? Pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was balanced very well with a portion of sea urchin balanced on the pasta (which you mix in). It was also very tasty.

The entrees were a little disappointing. We ordered the Branzino (fillet, not the entire fish) and I had the Dover Sole Romagna style (again, small portion size) - both were served with mashed potatoes (very buttery, well done) and saut√©ed veggies (also pretty standard). Honestly for $50 and $60 I expected the portion sizes to be a bit bigger - (-1 star)

Overall - pretty happy with the meal but would I come back? Probably not. Good enough to try once but not return again and again IMHO. Lots of great dining spots in LA.More</p>
<p>Angelini Osteria is my GO TO place when I'm craving THE BEST  Italian food in LA.  The dover sole, whole branzino,  sea urchin pasta and PROFITEROLES are must gets.  I frequent this place  and the food and service are consistently on point.  The best couples'...spot (PRE-COVID)  was the inside bar area.  I look forward to the re-opening of the inside again.  This place will not disappoint.More</p>
<p>Looked forward to visit.
Busy.
Rushed staff offering little description.
Had the Uni pasta.
Very little uni.
It was kinda good/good.
Not a top tier place - maybe average.</p>
<p>Everything is wonderful starting with the service and through each course.  Homemade pasta, delicious sauces, appropriate serving size.  The ambiance inside is perfect or enjoy outside dining.  Come here every time I‚Äôm in town and have never been disappointed-lasagna amazing! Dover sole, fregola starter! Make...a ReservationMore</p>
<p>I enjoyed dining at Angelini Osteria.  The service was fine, the menu was somewhat limited but they are able to execute this tight menu quite well.  I do not believe this restaurant is for everyone, as the offerings might be a bit too avant-garde, if...you are looking for your traditional rendition of Chicken Parmagina with Spaghetti or Linguini with White Clam sauce-then I would suggest Dan Tana's in West Hollywood.  This place successfully serves up a more authentic Italian experience, I opted for Seafood Risotto consisting of clams, mussels, lobster and calamari-the portion size was small for the price point but the risotto was well prepared.  I submit that the risotto is made here properly with consistent stirring of fish stock into the starch until it is fully cooked instead of the shortcut some places use that involves boiling the rice to cut time on the cooking process, there's no way everything is not done fresh here, trust me it is.  My wife ordered a meat lasagna made with spinach-again you can plainly see that this is freshly prepared, the lasagna was an adequate portion as well-certainly not oversized but not terribly undersized either.  They basically give you just enough to eat at this restaurant, which is fine but take that into consideration if your expectations are different prior to walking in.  I didn't leave the place hungry but some might depending on what they order.  We had a homemade bread pudding for dessert and I considered this to be one of the highlights of our visit, it was truly a fantastic rendition on the classic dessert.  The wine list is extensive yet once again overpriced and barely meets value-stressing portion again with the wine, they aren't giving you any extra drops in the perfectly portioned controlled glass for $18.  
     I would suggest you try this place if you've not been before, but I will likely not return.  There are so many options in West Hollywood and Beverly Hills that I would be inclined to revisit then this place.  Good but not Great.More</p>
<p>We hadn't eaten at Angelini for years, and having just returned from southern Italy, we were excited to try their latest offerings with friends. We were immediately warned that the sole was briny, and fish was what we were looking for. OK. Shrimp pasta with...cherry tomatoes was the next option, and it was simply awful. The food wasn't fresh, the noodles were limp and the sauce gave us the impression that the tomatoes were well past their prime.

Zucchini flowers, another favorite dish of ours, were fried as if it were tempura and the sauce was a spicy disaster, and again, didn't seem fresh. The soups were passable, but not great. Panna cotta dessert was stiff as if mixed in a blender too long, and worse of all the service took 2 1/2 hours start to finish. Bus boys reached over me to retrieve an empty soup bowl while I was eating. Not what you want out of a 200 dollar dinner. This is top rated, Italian eatery and yes, we know that LA is known for poor food, but AO had been an exception. Can't wait to get back to Capri for real food.More</p>
<p>We‚Äôre on a holiday visiting family here and they recommended this restaurant to us. Honestly couldn‚Äôt recommend this place more, the food, the atmosphere, the staff. We will definitely be returning before we leave.</p>
<p>A perfect lunch on a flying visit to LA. The staff were so friendly, the service was first class and the food was amazing.

<p>First and foremost, book this restaurant if you want to visit, we arrived as a walk-in table of 5 and had to wait an hour although it appears their customers like to hang onto their table!

<p>Based on friend‚Äôs recommendation, my friends and I came here with an 2030 booking through OpenTable. Then because of some miscommunication between the hostesses and management we saw a group who arrived after us were seated before us. Finally seated at 2045. The uni pasta...lacked on the uni. But 4* because management made it up to us with free desserts, profuse apologies, and a promise that the next time they won‚Äôt screw up.More</p>

Thank you for sharing your stamp of approval! We are so glad you joined us at our new brasserie, and that you enjoyed the warmth of our atmosphere and the elevation of our cuisine.

The risotto is a favorite of ours as well!...More</p>
<p>This French/California hybrid is brand new in Hollywood, and I‚Äôm so glad we found it.  Located in the historic Roosevelt Hotel, we dined while staying at the hotel.  We had a wonderful experience, and can‚Äôt wait to go back to try different menu offerings.  

My...first compliment goes to the staff.  It is great and too uncommon to find a staff that is genuinely enthusiastic about their restaurant.  We talked to both the hostess and our server, and it was obvious they had tried everything on the menu, and they spoke knowledgeably and confidently about the quality of the food.  Our party consisted of my wife and two teenagers, and we all loved what the staff helped us settle on.

My daughter‚Äôs lobster pasta was delicious and had a lot of lobster in it.  It had a nice chunk of lobster as a centerpiece, which was a pleasant surprise.  The pasta and the chanterelles were shaped similarly, and that was really nice for getting great forkfuls.  My son got the 12 oz NY strip.  It was cooked perfectly medium rare at his request and was a beautiful cut of meat, seasoned beautifully.  

My wife‚Äôs salmon was delicious!  She also got the green beans, and they were so good.  I got the Branzino.  SO AMAZING.  It was delicious, perfectly cooked, and the presentation was spot on.  I really wanted to try the Mushroom and black truffle risotto, but I so rarely see Branzino, I had to get it.  Someone please try the risotto and let me know.  

The cocktails and desserts were also first class.  The lemon meringue tart is renamed ‚ÄúIsland‚Äù something and is served with ice cream.  My family raved about it.

I can‚Äôt recommend this restaurant highly enough!  Cheers and enjoy!More</p>
<p>I was with a friend for dinner, at first they made us wait inside and then an arrogant waiter made us sit outside the room and wait our turn.  We were given the menu without prices and only at my request was I given the...full menu with prices.  We had dinner at the bar and I have to say the sushi is good.  But the real problem is the rudeness of a waiter and the chef who served us at the bar.  When we asked for the bill, it seemed to us that the bill was not correct and we asked for clarifications on the final bill ... the Chef who served us, with great rudeness, allowed himself to tell us "pay and go out!" with a sign of the hand, while the waiter with an annoyed air did not deign to greet us.  In my opinion, there are better sushis and you will certainly be treated well.  I recommend to stay away from this restaurant.More</p>
<p>This is the classic LA sushi restaurant that has stayed true to its old self. Two pieces per order, fresh fish, typically served unseasoned, limited menu (has all the fish you would recognize). I have frequented since the late 80s and pretty much nothing has...changed. Quality has been maintained and the no reservations plus a very long queue remains the trademark of this restaurant.

Don‚Äôt expect surprises - you come here for the freshest pieces served unseasoned. Service is fast and I pretentious.

Prepare for a long wait though. If you come late and wait for sushi bar the wait is shorter.More</p>
<p>Want a little abuse with your sushi? Then look no further than Sushi Gen.

They don't take reservations, which is fine.  So we arrived and put our name on waiting list. They said the wait would be 30 minutes. It turned out to be an...hour and a half and during that time standing in the parking lot of the strip mall they inhabit, many people who came well after us were seated well before us. 

We finally examined their wait list and realized there were two columns to it and that the two weren‚Äôt treated equally. Exactly what they based their segregation upon, I suspect, but can‚Äôt know for sure. Regardless, the sushi did not justify the long wait and the *rude* attitude of their two ‚Äúhosts‚Äù. (What kind of sushi would justify such inhospitable treatment?)

Yes: it‚Äôs really good sushi. But there are probably twenty other sushi restaurants in Los Angeles that are as good or better. So why eat where they treat you like they could not give a damn that you are there. (And maybe preferred you weren‚Äôt.)More</p>
<p>Carry out only but it worth the wait, I love sushi and this place has the best one i have ever had, very fresh, high quality ingredients.</p>
<p>This sushi restaurant was highly recommended to us by a friend who lives in the area as being someplace that's well worth the long wait.  We got here right as the dinner period was picking up and put ourselves on the wait list, and ended...up waiting almost an hour in the parking lot.  However, once our table was ready - wow!  The sushi was some of the freshest and most delicious that we've ever had.  We shared the plum roll, salmon belly, and tuna roll, as well as a beef teriyaki, and everything was utterly fantastic.  The staff were super professional and polite, and the food came out in good time, which is a sign that they took great pains to serve food that was both delicious and aesthetically pleasing.  The restaurant itself is pretty small, which might account for part of the long wait - this place can only accommodate so many people.More</p>

<p>Very friendly staff and great tasting sushi. Wide variety to choose from. Very fresh looking and tasting.</p>
<p>Sushi Gen is my goto spot in Little Tokyo.  Affordable and fresh!  This place is one of Little Tokyo's gems.</p>
<p>And they draw a big crowd, but to me very over-rated.  Also, the manager would not let me watch while they took my credit card into the kitchen to run it.  "Our insurance does not allow it."  For the first time in 7 months a...couple of weeks ago, I let a stranger have complete control of it, out of my sight, unlike in Europe & Canada, where security is better. or even in American when I walk with the server and watch them put the chip in (or swipe it)..  Guess what happens this morning?  Some cleaning supply charge is put onto my card on the web and I have to close it and get a new card and re-do monthly recurring charges.  Was it Sushi Gen?  How do I prove it but I know I'll never go back there again.  My own insurance won't allow it.More</p>
<p>This is by far the best sushi you can have in LA. Authentic. Tasty. Good service. The only thing is you have to book ahead.</p>
<p>If you have not been here you are missing out on really good, authentic Japanese food. You must book ahead at least a week! In atmosphere it is the closest to being in Tokyo I have been to. The service is swift and the clientele...were  lively. 

The menu is big and rather daunting. For a first visit I would recommend choosing a set meal like sashimi platter or the chicken teriyaki. Both come with miso soup and tempura. 

Dinner for 3 and saki $120.More</p>
<p>My friend reserved this place for me, and I enjoyed their sushi very much. I did not like little tokyo so much, but I will surely come back for Sushi Gen!</p>
<p>Good food, nice services. Lots of Japanese people visit this place as well. All I did was order what ever the Japanese order. I mean it must be good if the Japanese order right?</p>
<p>Great Sushi place!!! I absolutely loved it, awesome. Great service and the product as-well. Probably the best Japanese food that I have had in Los Angeles! Thank you very much!!</p>
<p>A nice sushi place in little Tokyo. We can around 11.30 and had to wait for a table  for 40 minutes. The place was very busy. However, 1-2 people can find a spot faster  by the bar. Food quality is very good. Service nothing is...More</p>
<p>This place is very authentic, not a snobby Beverly Hills Japanese restaurant at all. Prices are moderate. We paid 155USD with tip in total for 2 person. about 74 dollars per person. But the quality of the fish we had was amazing. Also we had...More</p>
<p>It was good, not as great as expected.  Service was a bit lacking. The Menu selection was excellent and the prepared food was good.</p>
<p>nice restaurant, taste good and if you need seconds or even thirds rush and get there so you can experience a fabulous time. comfortable dressing is allowed and filling the you belly with their delights is ;exactly what you'll like to do</p>
<p>we were looking for sushi but didnt want rolls with fried shrimp, spicy tuna, soft shell crab, so landed with sushi gen.  very crowded, but maybe it is a friday. seated by the sushi bar where no dinner menu, only serve sushi.  sushi is ok,...More</p>
<p>Been eating here for many many many years.  Seating is always difficult to get and tightly packed at the bar, chefs are gruff bordering on unfriendly, and parking can be a hassle in the busy pay lot, but don't let any of that stop you...More</p>

<p>This place is amazing.  you must make a reservation or you will wait.  when we first arrived it was a strip mall, not the nicest place but you soon realize there are people outside waiting for a table.  that is always a good sign.  then...More</p>
<p>We love have new experience in the food this place need to be more known but overall the experience of the taste are amazing</p>
<p>Cannot go wrong with any item on their menu.  I went here in my "splurge" day.  If on a budget, go to Kura revolving  sushi inside nearby Tokyo Town.  In fairness  Sushi Gen has more tantalizing selections.</p>
<p>Went for a late lunch mid week and was fortunate to get some seats by the sashimi bar. The Otoro tuna was a highlight- some of the best I‚Äôve had outside of Japan. The eel was delicious. The range of options was quite large. The...More</p>
<p>Wow, wow, wow. We have an over-the-top, artsy, extraordinary sushi restaurant near us in Dallas Texas. My son won't eat sushi anywhere else. We came here, and after careful consideration, he said that the difference is the place in Dallas has Americanized their portions and...More</p>
<p>this is the best you have to eat here if you go to LA it's soo good I got lamb it was the best ever</p>
<p>Our tour guide dropped our bus load off at The Farmers Market, to both experience the Market and have lunch.  Before we arrived, I saw a travel video on Market lunch places  so we followed a recommendation to Pampas Grill and were not disappointed.  It's...a fun experience, worth the wait in line, and the food was delicious.  It's a rather small operation, where you choose your food cafeteria style on a tray and take it to any of the available tables out in the market.  After you get your tray, you select what you want from the salad and hot selection areas before moving on to the meat station;  varying Brazilian cuts are hand carved, at your choice, onto your plate.  You then pay by the weight of your plate; there are two price points, one with and one without meats.  It's a fun experience, and the food was delicious.  There was no need for diner later at night!More</p>
<p>Always visit here when I am in town. Meat cooked to perfection. Great selection of salads and hot sides.  Cant wait to be back</p>
<p>High quality comfort food for a very fair price. It's real brazilian food, the meat is very good (don't miss the picanha) and the buffet has great options.</p>
<p>Meat was over cooked and dry. It had good flavor but that did not make up for texture. If they more thinly sliced it maybe that would be better. I liked that it was self service so you can pick your own portions and number...of sides. Sides were good but the star which was the meat was bad.More</p>
<p>Went for a Saturday lunch. First thing- there was (as usually l long line (wait is about 25-30 min). Food is fresh, very good selection at the salad bar, warm meals bar as well as meats. They charge by weight, have around 3 different options...(meat only, meat + salad bar, meat + salad bar + warm dishes).
My favorites black beans stew, garlic beef, leg of lamb, cheese roll.
Very decent prices.
I would highly recommend and definitely it is worth of the wait.More</p>
<p>the side dishes are so good, the collards are yum, the grilled meat is delicious, the plantains were cooked just like i like them, all was fantastic and its weighed at the end so you take as much as you can eat, and mine was...only $14 for a big platefull.More</p>
<p>Great cafeteria style Brazilian food.  Long lines but went pretty fast.  Bread was a little dry.  Great selection of choices.  Good salad bar.  A bit pricey per pound but the taste keeps me coming back again, and again.  6 to 7 different meat choices.  The...lamb was super tender and great flavor.  Not a super gamey tastle at all.  Can get it to go or dine in.More</p>
<p>Is a Very good place in farmers place. Very good meat and the prices are Very good for California. So Many different cuts of meats</p>
<p>Fav Brazilian BBQ in LA! 

Located in the Grove. Even though you line up and select what you want and then take it to a seat or to go, this is the best Brazilian BBQ in LA! Even better than the famous expensive Brazilian restaurants.</p>
<p>Delicious food. My family and I had lunch every other day throughout the week we were in Los Angeles. Garlic Top sirloin steak (picanha no alho) and regular sirloin steak (picanha) are very tasty. It even has Guarana as a drink to go with it....The kids loved it ....More</p>
<p>Inside the Farmer‚Äôs Market at the Grove we grabbed a quick lunch here. It‚Äôs Brazilian food ‚Äì meat cooked on long metal rods, just like if you want to a Brazilian steakhouse ‚Äì except your not paying $49 per person. You pay by the pound...‚Äì meaning they weigh your plate at the register. They also have a salad bar. We had steak, chicken and sausage ‚Äì all were very good. There was a line to get food there the whole time we were there, which was lunchtime on a Tuesday.More</p>
<p>This restaurant is just wonderful. You pay by how heavy your plate is and their meat is all excellent. You just have to make sure that you take a medium well done meat as the normal meat is a bit too red. The system is...really good and very Brazilian.More</p>
<p>Love coming here. Food is always great! The Pao de quiejo is my favorite! Its cheesy and warm and I always load up!</p>
<p>If you enjoy steak then you must try here. It is lovely and really reasonable.  It is in Farmers Market. There are loads of places to eat but this is by far the best</p>
<p>It used to be cheap eats. Then they raised the prices by about 50%.
I don't go there anymore. $12.95 a LB adds up fast.</p>
<p>I tried several kinds of meat, and all were very tasteful and tender, even the leg of lamb was delicious. Dipping it in the jalapeno sauce made it even more delicious. It was a very long queu, but it is worth a try.</p>
<p>Farmers Market is such a great place with so many fabulous spots to stop and eat.  Pampas is high on the list of great choices.  The line can be long and slow but the service is great and so is the taste.</p>
<p>We tried the steaks, the cheese bread, and the salad. All tasted good with a decent price. The location is in the farmers market so lots of choices there.</p>
<p>This would be my first experience eating Brazilian BBQ, and it was such a success to have Pampas Grill as my first experience! The meats are so juicy and tender, and not to mention the taste.. perfect! With lots of option of side-dishes. A luxurious...More</p>
<p>Our city tour guide John recommended this place and we weren‚Äôt disappointed. There was a constant line to get in. The range of salads was very good and the 8 types of bbq meats were really good. I limited myself to the top sirloin, leg...More</p>
<p>Spicy chicken & Top Sirloin. 
Slightly on the salty side for the beef.

Spicy sauce is ok for my standard. Could be hotter. 
Spicy Chicken is rather salty.

<p>According to prices it was expensive but with great selection. Super food, it was tasty and in time. Great stop and totally worth it!</p>
<p>Visit this restaurant in the evening. The queu was so long but it was worth the effort. The meat was so delicious. Recommended.</p>
<p>My favorite restaurant in the farmers market. The meat was so flavorful ordered chicken and steak. They have great difed love the potato salad beets collard greens. There is a line but worth waiting.</p>
<p>Super food. I really loved what I ordered, it was tasty and in time. According to prices it was expensive but with great selection. The quality of the meat in this restaurant was nuts. The service was good at all</p>
<p>WOW, what a pleasant surprise hiding out in the Farmer's Market of L.A.! I got lamb, top sirloin, and spicy chicken plus sides for $12.50 and I seriously couldn't even pick a favorite. Would love to take this place back to Nebraska with me! Highly...More</p>
<p>Fantastic food, reasonably priced. The selection is huge and the quality of the meat is just fantastic. Highly recommend if at the Farmers Market!</p>
<p>All the food were delicious, the hot and sour soup, never had one like this one before.  Want to come again to eat it again.  The Lychee mojito and greet tea superb. It was such a wonderful experience with my love ones!</p>
<p>You can never go wrong here. Everything is fantastic. Service is perfect. A pleasant surprise... Due to medical reasons, noodles are a no-no. Get the pork chop ... The best I ever had. Seriously...</p>
<p>Been to this restaurant on our last visit to California (2016) and dropped in again thinking we'd walk right in. We had a 60+ minute wait (we were allowed to come back an hour later and wait another 10-15 mins). As always great service and...superb food. We ordered the Chicken and Pork Xiao Long Bao Buns and a Chicken Fired Rice.More</p>
<p>No surprise this is the number one restaurant in Glendale. Our server Steve was amazing and so was the food. We had the wood ear mushroom and seaweed salads, beautiful bok choy with scallion infused oil, their famous steamed buns and a stir fry and...all were outstanding. Steve was the the icing on the cake - super friendly, informative and efficient. Thanks for a wonderful evening.More</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been to three of their locations and all are dynamite. I know exactly what to order and exactly what to expect. Bottom line‚Ä¶it‚Äôs all super great. The service, the food‚Ä¶awesome! Never a bad experience</p>
<p>I had to go here after seeing all the tik tok videos. Lol. Glad it didn‚Äôt disappoint!! All the food was delicious, I will go back to try more of the menu. Recommend that you reserve in advance to avoid long waits.</p>
<p>We were very hungry and after ordering 3 plates each we were not full.   Always love the soup dumplings and service was friendly and efficient‚Ä¶ however, it‚Äôs noisy, rushed and expensive, so we will modify our visits.  Been 4 times to LJ location after discovering...in Glendale years ago.More</p>
<p>Delicious experience! We had a very helpful waitress who recommended all the best dishes . We enjoyed every single one of them! The xiao long bao were unlike anything else. Sticky buns, spicy noodles and all varieties of shrimp and pork dumplings were a hit....Can‚Äôt wait to go back!More</p>
<p>Was looking forward to this popular restaurant.   Oh boy; what a disapointment with the food quality!  All items served lukewarm!  Who wants wonton soup barely warm?  Rice steamed and fried ,not warm/hot and not cooked (rice needed to be cooked more and warmer!)  How about...cooking til it's done?

Thought maybe we made a mistake and were eating in a non Asian/Taiwanese restaurant!  

Can see why it's a chain! No originality, flavor, taste!  
 
Looking for authentic Taiwanese food, don't go here!More</p>
<p>We booked a reservation at the Glendale location on May 7th for 4 of us. We didn't have to wait long before we were seated. Staff was friendly. The food was amazing. I highly recommend this place.</p>
<p>We had dumpling, fried rice, spinach,  and sesame noodle, and they‚Äôre all great!!!  We went there around 11:30am, so we didn‚Äôt have to wait in lines at all.</p>
<p>Book a reservation online or be prepared for a long wait. Food is great and the service always attentive. I never have had a bad meal here.</p>
<p>My daughter was dying to come here when we decided to take a vacation to LA. The Glendale location was so beautiful! The staff was engaging and friendly. The food was AMAZING! You must try the soup dumplings and chocolate balls for dessert. Everything we...picked was incredible! Reasonably priced for the amount of food. Can‚Äôt wait for it to open in NYC.More</p>
<p>Visiting LA this week as brother lives in Glendale area, dinner here tonight (a Wednesday night) for our group of 4  (3 adults & teenage daughter); had our name placed ~6:20pm,  was informed ~ 1 hour wait.  We were seated at 8pm.  We were not...allowed to order drinks at bar or allowed to even sit at bar for drinks while waiting --only can order "until you are seated" was the explanation.  Perhaps better communication or offer some seats while waiting.  No benches or very limited (1-2 chairs) seating were available, not appropriate for those disabled, elderly or children.   Almost 95% of those waiting  for their seating stood against the wall or outside (no seats there either)---   seating in-house was packed, so why not provide seats to those waiting?    Walked about the mall area for 1 hour and table was still not available.   We had all our dim sum choices on their ticket picked out and ready for wait staff by the time we were seated & all arrived one by one.  We were out of restaurant within 45 minutes. 
Dim sum served all day but according to my brother,  the carts bearing food (typical of true dim sum) are only there early (not sure what time it ends), so the dim sum is off a menu.   
Food was decent but nothing really uniquely different or anything original (wanted chicken feet as our teenager wanted this but not on menu).  Individual dumplings size was on the small side, for reference our dim sums have been few cities  Las Vegas, San Francisco, Chicago, and Seattle.   Bottom line:  1) Don't think the food was worth almost the 2 hour wait for limited dim sum on menu; and they were out of a few things already.   2)  The 3 people at the check-in desk could have also been better with communicating  & more organized  to those waiting- suggest occasionally updating wait status-  if have known sooner, could've gone elsewhere.More</p>
<p>I stopped in for lunch to this very popular restaurant and ate outside.  The server was extremely professional and went above an beyond in offering guidance.  The most well known dishes feature their pork but as a non-meat eater I was happy with the vegetarian...options.  Overall, it was a unique experience and a great chance to try something different.  Loved the cream ice tea,More</p>
<p>tried the Din Tai Fung in UAE so I had to go when I was in Los Angeles. Perfect just the way I remember it. Took the family and they enjoyed the dumplings too. will always stop in if I can.</p>

<p>If you can handle the wait this dim sum restaurant is worth it.  Soup dumplings a must!  I‚Äôve been to 5 different branches including Bellville WA  and  Dubai.  All food is Exactly the same.</p>
<p>Plenty of space, very modern venue.  We selected several dishes to have an  assortment of dumplings, several vegetables, noodles and more. The food is fresh and prepared well. Service was helpful, considerate and prompt.</p>
<p>I love this place for lunch.  If you love dumplings then this is a must.  A wide variety, fresh, and generous portions.  We shared shrimp and pork, chicken noodle soup, and spicy wonton.  Moderately priced but not cheap.  Great location, parking good. .</p>
<p>Had noodles with spicy pork sauce, cucumber salad, vegetarian dumplings and spicy chicken wontons-the favorite for all. Nice service and drink options. The servers need to explain the making of the sauce better. We had to ask what the ginger was for and how to...More</p>
<p>Visiting from Washington, DC, this stylish place offered good soup dumplings and a respectable noodle dish.  It is very popular, but we do know better and far less expensive places serving similar food in the DC region.</p>

<p>Here in Pasadena for a one day trip and we picked Russell‚Äôs based off the great reviews. It did not disappoint! The staff was incredible. We watched them clean a table and get new customers seated in under a minute. The food was great. We...ordered the waffle breakfast and the Denver omelet. We would definitely come back again!More</p>
<p>This spot is THE BEST   Staff is terrific. Coffee is great  Service is top notch. Owner is hands on and makes everyone feel welcome and respected</p>
<p>I went to pick up an order for a client this morning and had a terrible experience. As usual, the restaurant was busy. I went to the counter and waited for approximately 30 seconds. Normally the orders are not on the counter but this morning...there were two. After waiting, I grabbed the receipt to see if it was the order I was assigned to pick up, all of a sudden Ryan (who was standing right by the orders but doing something else) yelled as though I‚Äôd shot someone, ‚ÄúHey! Don‚Äôt touch the orders!‚Äù I didn‚Äôt say anything, so he repeated what he said. Again, I didn‚Äôt answer. The order was repeated by someone else to whom I responded, ‚ÄúI just wanted to see if it was mine.‚Äù The order was repeated and I responded that I just wanted to see who the order was for (it turned out to be the one assigned to me and the employee immediately gave it to me). Ryan, however, saw it fit to call me a ‚Äúsh*t head‚Äù. I asked what he called me and he repeated it. 

I‚Äôve gone to this restaurant numerous occasions, both as a customer and to pick up for clients, and normally I‚Äôm treated well by the employees but this was my first time seeing Ryan and I most likely won‚Äôt return as a customer. Any restaurant who allows employees to use foul language toward anyone (internal customers, external customers, other employees) shouldn‚Äôt be frequented by the public. 

I eventually spoke to someone who said they were owner (I doubt very seriously he was) and when I told him what I was called he stated ‚ÄúWell you said something to him.‚Äù When I asked if he heard what I said (which was me explaining why I looked at the order) he replied, ‚ÄúNo but you said something to him.‚Äù That is no excuse for an employee swearing at someone doing business with their establishment nor do I believe it is the response an owner would give anyone who just told him one of his employees called him a ‚Äúsh*t head‚Äù. I‚Äôm very disappointed. I actually like Russell‚Äôs breakfast menu but Pasadena has lots of restaurants and I‚Äôll gladly go someplace else.More</p>
<p>Breakfast was simply amazing. The coffee was incredible. If the owner/anyone thar works there read this can you please tell me the brand of the coffee?</p>
<p>Thank you for your great review.  The coffee brand is Jose's Organic French Roast.</p>
<p>Touring through Pasadena, my wife and I were looking for a lunch spot to relax and savor the local atmosphere.  We really found it in Russell's! We arrived late for lunch, so we were promptly seated in a comfortable booth.  The walls are adorned with...classic artwork of the Masters, giving a feeling that you might be dining in an art museum or someone's Victorian home.  Our server was engaging and very efficient.  Our food selections lived up to the wonderful overall ambiance.  I got the  avocado bacon Swiss grilled chicken club;  topped with melted Swiss cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and house slaw.  The sandwich came in a paper sleeve so that you could navigate it. My wife got the Croque Monsieur; classic French ham & cheese sourdough sandwich with ham, melted Gouda cheese, Mornay sauce and fries. We chased our lunch down with Jones soda - a refreshing change from your standard colas. Our choices were very favorable, done to perfection, and quite original.  This place is a winner!More</p>
<p>Outstanding breakfast. Generous portions, quick service, pleasant and clean decor. Easy to see why this is a local favorite. Absolutely would return. Nice that they validate parking for public garage immediately behind restaurant - reflects a good management!</p>
<p>The food was plentivful and the   camphange split was  nice for my cousin.  The view of the sidewalk reminded me of Seattle.</p>
<p>This is a solid option for breakfast in Old Town Pasadena.  The space isn't very big and the place is popular so be prepared for a wait - sometimes a long one.  Food is good and the service is attentive.  I enjoyed the waffle with...bacon.More</p>
<p>We stopped in here for breakfast. We were told it would be a 20 minute wait. But we barely waited two minutes. So that was good. The service was friendly and the food was delicious. 
I had French toast which was nice and thick and...tasty. 
My husband had like a skillet type breakfast with potatoes and veggies and cheese and avocado. He really enjoyed it. 
Prices were good for what you get. 
Loved this place.More</p>
<p>Nice last minute find for breakfast, lunch menu looked great too. Recommend to go early or else expect a wait for a table!</p>
<p>Visiting CA from FL, my stomach was running 3 hours ahead of my hotel‚Äôs breakfast availability. The Marriott Courtyard was a quick walk from Russell‚Äôs, so I gave it a try. Do not be tricked into thinking this is a coffee shop; this is an...excellent restaurant that happens to open very early. You detect a difference when you realize classical music is playing and prints of great art grace the walls above the booths. The portions are huge, and the waitstaff was very solicitous of a single woman dining alone.More</p>
<p>The owners really know what their restaurant is about.  Classical music and reproductions of art by the Masters in a beautifully maintained setting surround you.  Then the menus show up.  Then the food.  We were there for breakfast and all we can say is that...lunch was suddenly unnecessary.  The food was delicious and the portions huge.  This a great place for breakfast or lunch in Old Pasadena.More</p>
<p>Hi Brian,

Thank you very much for your wonderful review!  I do my best to make my restaurant like my home, hence the classical music and the decor. I am so glad that you have enjoyed it and once again, thank you for the wonderful...More</p>
<p>If we'd been here i when the place first opened in 1930, we probably wouldn't have had to wait so long for a table.  Then again, the wait was definitely worth it.  We were eventually seated in a narrow, cozy, very colorful alcove, sporting bright...red walls punctuated by what seemed vivid, high quality prints of famous paintings.  

This narrow sliver of a dining area was very busy and a little tight for the wait staff to navigate with their big serving trays (kudos for them).  In such a small space, there was quite a din, as happy/chatty people enjoyed good food and conversation.  We found the noisy ambience to be sparkling and pleasant, rather than annoying, and it added a little zip to our 3-generation family brunch.

We indulged ourselves with some very well made Croques Monsieur, served with a side of fresh fruit, accompanied by large coffees and even larger glasses of fruit juice to wash it all down.  One of our party was under 2 years old.  He got a special chair, ate and behaved well, bothered no one, and had a great time.  We all had fun here.  We appreciated that children, even babies and toddlers, were welcome. 

Do try to come early and be prepared to wait.  Breakfast might be easier than brunch-time, when it's more crowded. There are seats outside on the sidewalk, or you can take a stroll through the fine old neighborhood with its wonderful storefronts. 

Highly Recommended.More</p>
<p>Great Breakfast! Good food, great service, and definitely would return. My husband and I waited about 30 min on a Saturday morning. Once we were seated we were offered coffee right away. We chose to share the ABC omelet and a stack of pancakes. We...were very happy with our food. Our server was very nice and anticipated our needs without hovering. We really enjoyed our breakfastMore</p>

<p>8 of us ladies went after swim practice at the Rose Bowl. New experience for me since I live in the central valley. A bit of a wait but that's to be expected for a large group. Food arrived quickly I had the Belgian waffle...More</p>
<p>Glad we found this place. Ate breakfast twice during our stay and would definitely come back. Traditional dishes cooked perfectly,  great service and good coffee. Our kind of place!</p>
<p>Russell's has been established since 1930 and it is, apparently, a tradition for those driving Route 66, to stop for a bite. It was a Saturday evening when we decided to go and really didn't know what to expect.
It is an American Diner, albeit,...More</p>
<p>Get there early if you're going for Breakfast. I think we arrived around 9am and there was about a 20 minute wait.  However, the service is excellent and the food arrived quickly. I'm a huge omelet fan and the Mexican omelet did not disappoint. My...More</p>
<p>We came here for breakfast on a Saturday morning (we‚Äôre early birds, so we just missed the rush and were seated right away). The egg breakfasts come with an option to upgrade to a Belgian waffle rather than toast. I haven‚Äôt had a waffle in...More</p>
<p>The wait on a Friday morning was 45 minutes.  Trusting the reviews we had maybe too much expectation for a fantastic meal.  It‚Äôs average diner food.  Nothing to rave about and certainly not a 5 star place.  My wife and I both had omelets and...More</p>

Food and service is okay - not really exceptional 
Portions are huge so make sure you share</p>
<p>Very good place for breakfast. Good selection and all very tasty. Staff was very efficient and friendly.</p>
<p>EVERYONE! You have to check your receipts every time you go there! 
This is my second time. That I visited their restaurant, but when I received the bill I noticed there is 18% gratuities that was automatically included and we were a party of two....We noticed that they charge and take advantage of the Arab ethnic population. I actually checked the next table near to our and he showed me his bill no gratuity was added. 

Please make sure you don‚Äôt get ripped off like they tried to take advantage of us. 
According to their company policy! 

(Orders over $100 will be charged a 10% prep-charge.
An 18% gratuity will be added to any parties of 6 or more, or bills exceeding $100.)More</p>
<p>Terrible food. It is trendy with the locals but the food is really bad. I would not recommend this place at all.</p>
<p>Amazing! I would recommend it to anyone. It's not my first time here, I come back more and more! If you crave for some pastries than this is the right place to go.</p>
<p>Bottom line is Nice place and food is ok But service is Slow uneven and ita very expensive for breakfast. They are clearly understaffed and expect delays...sad</p>
<p>Had worst and rude server going there 
Place was highly rec by my hotel Concierge
Maybe as a tourist asking some question to the server should have been more helpful 
He had an attitude 
Mannerless server

Had a high expection but sometimes servers like this can spoil the mood to even dine there

<p>Since I ate in this place I was fascinated by everything they offered me to eat and I naturally wanted to try the best and if it was the best</p>
<p>I love their Tony's salad! the pecans, blue cheese, strawberries and avocado.... yummy! Service is professional and quick. I recommend!</p>
<p>My wife and I were tiring of our hotel breakfast option while touring LA, so we wanted to get out and experience a local breakfast option.  We chose Toast from Trip Advisor, and were not disappointed.  Only downside was finding a "qualified" spot, other than...paying $10 in an adjacent garage or metered parking.  We lucked out and found a spot only a block away.  The restaurant offers both in and outside service, but on this cool morning we dined inside.  The ambiance is comfortable, the service swift, and the food delicious.  My wife ordered the 3rd street -  spinach, swiss and feta cheese omelet, and I got the classic pancakes with sides of eggs and bacon.  All was done to order, nicely presented, and very tasty.  Tea and coffee were both delivered hot.  Our bill was somewhat pricey, but I'll give it a pass due to egg prices.  Excellent choice and experience.More</p>
<p>If you're looking for a great little place to have brunch with friends you should definitely check out post on 3rd Street they have a extensive menu and they have gluten and vegetarian options which is fantastic if you're in a big group.

Take a...look at the menu online I definitely recommend the avocado toast the breads and french toast are fantastic they are at bakery as well.More</p>
<p>Such a nice place for breakfast! I really liked the food and service. I would come again definitely. I took breakfast combo and the French toast which was amazing!</p>
<p>Sat outside and enjoyed good service and food. V relaxing. Menu was extensive and portions were v generous. We had pancakes, fruit and avocado and eggs. Salad was fresh with nice dressings.</p>
<p>Came for Saturday brunch and was pleased when our party of three was seated outdoors right away. The service was attentive and excellent. We found street parking right across from the restaurant without too much trouble. The Chilaquiles were excellent and spicy- too filling for...me, but hubby happily finished it off. The Eggwich was also good. Both of us wished for more seasoning on the potatoes. The Sofritos Enchilada were also flavorful. The seating area was pleasant for such a busy area. Plenty of shade and space from other parties.More</p>
<p>We tried Toast with our daughter and we thought it was very good.  We were seated right away though it was crowded.  The service was very good as was the food.  I had a bowl of fruit and vanilla yogurt which was delectable!</p>
<p>The portions are so HUGE at this place. We ordered five dishes between four adults and one toddler and the table barely had enough room for all of our plates! The portions are big for not only California but really anywhere. The food was delicious...and memorable.

Had THE PORTOBELLO omelette and it was delicious! Had VANILLA LATTE as well with almond milk and it was just perfect!

The staff was attentive and clean. Sat outside and the heater kept us nice and warm.

Overall, will definitely return!More</p>
<p>Visited Toast on our recent visit to LA. Food was very good, but the service was very slow. The Eggwich is recommended to those that like breakfast sandwiches.</p>
<p>Amazing tasty breakfast, great coffee and service. Highly recommend the chilaquiles. Would definitely come back given more time</p>

The food was superb everyone in my party was happy with our meals. I loved my pancakes. 

The music playlist at Toast is also fantastic! 

Highly recommend!</p>
<p>This is a perfect place for breakfast 
I had as always my strawberry pancakes and always so delicious,service always quick and friendly and coffee so gooood</p>
<p>Overpriced. Overrated. Poor option and bread are not good taste. They are trying to do like Urth coffee but they have failed.</p>

<p>Very busy street cafe.  Everything was tasty but portions were not large.  One the most expensive meals on our trip.  Single restroom for the whole restaurant = long line.</p>
<p>Had a really good lunch here at the Toast Bakery Cafe. The service was super fast and friendly. Highly recommend coming here for breakfast/brunch/lunch. Expect a wait, it's always busy!</p>
<p>Fun, lively place with indoor and outdoor dining. Good food, good service, good prices, good menu. Unbeatable combo. Did not have this visit but understand that any of the soups are worth ordering more of to take home.</p>
<p>We went here each day of our holiday in LA. Nice servers. Good coffee and nice breakfast with little cookies and muffins in the side. Try the oatmeal with almond milk.</p>
<p>Mmmm, delicious breakfast. Friendly staff where nothing is a problem. The coffee was fantastic, our waiter took the time to put lists together of everthing we should see in the city. The food was delicious, kids loved there food. A definite must stop if in...More</p>
